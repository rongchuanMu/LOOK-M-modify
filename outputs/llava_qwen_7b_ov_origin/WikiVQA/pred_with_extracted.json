On the first day of the visit, Zelenska met with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Samantha Power, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. On the second day of the visit, she held a meeting with the first lady of the United States, Jill Biden, at the White House. Zelenska was also met on the porch of the White House by US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  \nZelenska also addressed the US Congress on the second day of her visit, becoming the first First Lady of another country to speak before the US Congress. She called for more military aid to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to protect the country from Russian invasion.  \nZelenska dedicated the beginning of her speech to the families and children impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. One of the images included was of a four-year-old Liza Dmytriyeva, who was killed in an air strike in the central-western city of Vinnytsia. Zelenska also showed photos and videos of the victims of the Kremenchuk shopping mall attack and other numerous victims of Russian invasion.  \nDuring the trip, Zelenska also accepted the Dissident Human Rights Award at the Victims of Communism Memorial in Washington, D.C., on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people.  \nOn July 23, Ukraine will host the second Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen dedicated to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. The event is planned to be held in the format of a telebridge between different countries of the world. Within the Summit, fundraising for C-type ambulance vehicles was announced. USD 6.4 million was raised in total, allowing to purchase 84 ambulance vehicles for the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. These ambulance vehicles are equipped with everything necessary to quickly and safely transport the seriously injured to the hospitals.  \nIn September 2022, Zelenska was present as an invitee to Ursula von der Leyen's third State of the European Union address, where the EU Commission President rendered homage to her courage during the war in Ukraine.  \nOn 19 September 2022, Zelenska attended the state funeral in London of Queen Elizabeth II to pay her respects to the late monarch \"on behalf of all Ukrainians\".  \nOn 2 October 2022, Zelenska visited Turkey, where she discussed the evacuation of Ukrainian orphans to Turkey with Turkish first lady Emine Erdo\u011fan, met ecumenical patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, and launched the Ukrainian corvette Hetman Ivan Mazepa.  \nZelenska was alleged by social media and several news outlets in France to have spent over \u20ac40,000 during a shopping spree in Paris, during her visit in December, however these claims proved to be false, and originally circulated by pro-Russia media.\n\n### Olena Zelenska Foundation  \n<ImageHere>Hillary Clinton and Olena Zelenska during the presentation of the foundation\nOn 22 September 2022, Olena Zelenska presented her foundation at a charity evening in New York City during the 77th UN General Assembly.  \nThe Foundation's primary goal is to restore Ukraine's human capital so that every Ukrainian feels physically and mentally healthy, protected, and able to exercise their right to education, work, and build a future in Ukraine.  \nThe Foundation has three key directions: medicine, education and humanitarian aid. Within these areas, it will provide targeted assistance, invest in reconstructing preschool and school education institutions, polyclinics and outpatient clinics, and provide grants for training and scientific developments. The Foundation sees foreign business and other international foundations as its key partners and donors.\n\n## Awards  \nZelenska received ShEO Awards 2022 in the nomination \u201cWorld Peace\u201d. The award was founded by Wprost, one of the most influential and oldest publications in Poland.  \nOn November 9, 2022, Olena Zelenska was included in the ELLE 100 Women.  \n<ImageHere>Zelenska meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in 2022\nOn December 6, 2022, the First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska received the Hillary Rodham Clinton Awards, presented annually by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security for exceptional leadership in recognizing the exceptional leadership in promoting women\u2019s rights and creating a more peaceful and secure world for all.  \nShe was honored as one of the BBC 100 Women in December 2022.\n\n\nQuestion: Which event did Olena Zelenska initiate that brought together eleven first ladies from different countries to discuss the post-COVID reality?\nChoice list: \nA.

Hall was one of Austria's largest cities in the late Middle Ages and is still a regional economic and cultural hub today.\n\n<ImageHere>(B-VG 117 (1))\nInformally, municipalities that are neither cities nor market towns are sometimes called Landgemeinden, lit. \"rural municipalities\".\n\n## Responsibilities  \nThe constitution distinguishes between a municipality's sphere of inherent responsibilities (eigener Wirkungsbereich) and the sphere of responsibilities delegated to the municipalities by the higher levels of government (\u00fcbertragener Wirkungsbereich). The constitution defines a minimum extent of the inherent sphere that national and provincial law may add to but not detract from: nowrap|(B-VG 118 (2))  \n* Levying municipal taxes (Gemeindeabgaben) and otherwise managing their own finances and their own property.  \n* Appointing municipal officials.  \n* Hiring and supervising municipal employees.  \n* Local security police (Sicherheitspolizei) and event control (Veranstaltungspolizei).  \n* Traffic space management including but not limited to road maintenance and traffic police.  \n* Crop protection (Flurschutz).  \n* Sanitary police matters, rescue services, interment services.  \n* Public decency (Sittlichkeitspolizei).  \n* Development planning, fire prevention, and general building code enforcement.  \n* Mediation services for out-of-court dispute resolution.  \nAdditional legislation vests municipalities with a large number of additional responsibilities. Municipalities are in charge of public water supply, sewage disposal, garbage disposal, public lighting, and cemetery construction and maintenance, among other things. They run schools and kindergartens, assisted living facilities, sports and cultural facilities, and fire departments. The purview each Austrian municipality is constitutionally guaranteed to have is a small share of the purview it has in practice. Matters of public services (Daseinsvorsorge) far outclass matters of political administration (Obrigkeitliche Verwaltungs) in terms of both salience and budgets. (Raschauer 2009, Rz 330.)  \n## Regional particularities  \n## Subdivisions  \n<ImageHere>Town hall of Markt Piesting, Lower Austria, population ca. 3,000\n\n<ImageHere>Town hall of Neufelden, Upper Austria, population ca. 1,300\nThe cities of Vienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt are divided into municipal districts (Stadtbezirke, colloquially just Bezirke).  \nMunicipal districts are not to be confused with administrative districts (politische Bezirke, but colloquially also just called Bezirke).  \nAdministrative districts are provided for by the constitution and play an important and highly visible role in Austria's national and regional administrations. Municipal districts are subsections of local administrations established by local laws.  \nVienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt are statutory cities and as such are equivalent to one administrative district each.  \nThe 23 districts of Vienna (Wiener Gemeindebezirke) and the 17 districts of Graz are vested with a limited form of precinct-level self-government. The district constituency elects a district assembly (Bezirksvertretung), the district assembly in turn elect a district commissioner (Bezirksvorsteher). District assemblies and commissioners are responsible for whatever matters the city chooses to devolve to them \u2013 in general, they run schools and take care of road maintenance, general neighborhood maintenance, and traffic planning. They have a certain measure of budgetary autonomy, although they cannot levy taxes and depend on money allocated to them by the city.  \nThe 15 districts of Klagenfurt are roughly neighborhood-sized quarters with no special autonomy.\n\n## Statistics  \nAs of January 1, 2018 there are 15 statutory cities in Austria, 186 other cities, 770 market towns, and 1127 other communes, for a total of 2,098 municipalities. One of these municipalities stands out: the city of Vienna is a statutory city and a state at the same time. At 1,900,000 inhabitants, the national capital also seven times larger than the second most populous city, Graz.  \nFor the other eight states, the numbers are as follows (Statistik Austria 2018):  \nWith respect to population, there is wide variation within each class of municipalities:  \nWith respect to area, the smallest municipality is Rattenberg at sqmi; the largest is S\u00f6lden in the thinly populated mountain territory of Tyrol at sqmi. The city of Vienna ranks second, at sqmi.\n\nQuestion: Which town hall is located in a municipality that, as of the provided information, is neither a city nor a market town in Austria?\nChoice list: \nA.

She is most famous for her participation, in 1804, in the battle of Pulo Aura. She foundered in 1811 while on her fifth trip.  \n## Career  \n### Voyage #1 (1801\u201302)  \nCaptain Andrew Patton sailed Ocean for Bombay and China. He had been captain of the company's previous 2, which had wrecked in 1797. Because the French Revolutionary Wars were still on going, Patton acquired a letter of marque, which was dated 10 December 1800.  \nOcean left Portsmouth on 9 January 1801 and reached on 22 May. From there she sailed for China. She reached Whampoa on 6 October. On the return leg she crossed the Second Bar on 7 December. She arrived at Saint Helena on 12 April 1802, and  The Downs on 10 June.  \n<ImageHere>A fleet of East Indiamen at Sea, by Nicholas Pocock; it is believed to show the Indiamen  Lord Hawkesbury, Worcester, 2, Fort William, 2, 2, Ocean, 2, Carnatic, 2 and Windham returning from China in 1802\n\n\n### Voyage #2 (1802\u201304)  \nOn Oceans second voyage, Patton was again her captain and he left The Downs on 13 October 1802 for the Cape of Good Hope, Madras, Bombay and China. After the resumption of war with France in 1803, Patton posthumously received a new letter of marque dated 1 July 1803 for the same vessel, with a crew of 140 men and 36 guns. Patton died at Bombay in June 1803; Oceans first lieutenant, John Christian Lochner, became captain and it was he that commanded her at the battle of Pulo Aura.  \n<ImageHere>Ocean can be seen in this printed key for a view of the Battle, showing the China Fleet a painting by Francis Sartorius, the younger after a drawing by an officer on board the Henry Addington\nOn 14 February 1804, the China Fleet, under the command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance, intimidated, drove off and chased a powerful French naval squadron at Pulo Aura. Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of fire. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger, whereupon he resumed his passage towards British India.  \nOcean reached Britain on 15 August 1804.  \nThe EIC voted a \u00a350,000 prize fund to be divided among the various commanders at the battle and their crews. Farrer received 500 guineas, and also a piece of plate worth 50 guineas. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund and other national and mercantile institutions made a series of awards of ceremonial swords, silver plate, and monetary gifts to individual officers. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave each captain a sword worth \u00a350, and one worth \u00a3100 to Nathaniel Dance. Dance refused a baronetcy but was subsequently knighted.\n\n### Voyage #3 (1805\u201306)  \nCaptain John(s) James Williamson became captain of Ocean for this and her next two voyages. The change of captain required the issuing of a new letter of marque. This one was dated 17 December 1804.  \nOn her third voyage she left Portsmouth on 8 March 1805, bound for Madras and China. She reached Madeira on 26 March, and Madras on 14 July.  \nThis voyage also saw combat, but of a more minor sort. On 7 August Ocean was in company with the East Indiamen 2, Dorsetshire, and 2 in a convoy escorted by naval vessels under the command of Sir Thomas Troubridge. The British exchanged fire with three French warships that included 2 and Marengo, which did not press the attack.  \nBy 27 August Ocean was at Penang, and then on 14 September she was at Malacca. She reached Whampoa on 22 December. On the return leg Ocean was \"off Chumpee\" (Chuenpee) in the Bocca Tigris, the estuary of the Pearl River, on 26 February 1806. She reached St Helena on 2 July, and arrived at the Downs on 3 September.  \n### Voyage #4 (1808\u201309)  \nOn Her fourth voyage, Ocean left Portsmouth on 5 March 1808, sailing for China. She reached the Cape of Good Hope on 31 May. From there she sailed to Madras, which she reached on 3 August. From there she sailed to Penang (22 August) and Malacca (3 September), before reaching Whampoa on 2 October. On the return leg she crossed the Second Bar on 2 February 1809. She reached St Helena on 7 July, and The Downs on 8 September.  \n### Voyage #5 (1810-loss)  \nOcean was again under the command of Captain Williamson when she departed in January 1810 for St. Helena, Bencoolen, and China. Ocean apparently foundered off Pulo Sapate in 1811. Because the ship foundered, there is little further information.  \nThe EIC valued the cargo lost on her at \u00a321,202. She appears on a list of vessels that are believed to have disappeared in typhoons in the India or China Seas.\n\nQuestion: Which ship is mentioned in the context of both images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\n<ImageHere>Artist's representation of the Ring\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy work The Lord of the Rings, the One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom during the Second Age to gain dominion over peoples of Middle-earth. He intended it to control those who wore any of the other Rings of Power. Since they were powerful, he had to put much of his own power as a Maia, a supernatural being, into the Ring to achieve this.  \nWhen the Stoorish Hobbit Sm\u00e9agol saw the Ring that his friend D\u00e9agol had found in the River Anduin, he killed D\u00e9agol to get it, and used the Ring's power of invisibility:  \nThe wizard Gandalf explains that Gollum was wholly corrupted by and addicted to the Ring:\n\n### The Ring's effects  \nA major theme is the corrupting influence of the Ring through the power it offers, especially to those already powerful. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes Gandalf's statements about the power and influence of the One Ring in \"The Shadow of the Past\", and the corrupting influence it has on its bearers. Gandalf rejects the Ring for this reason when Frodo offers it to him; this view of the Ring is reinforced as Elrond, Galadriel, Aragorn, and Faramir in their turn also reject it, fearing that it would overpower them as well. Inversely, the hobbits' good-naturedness and lack of ambition makes them less susceptible to the Ring's promises of power, as in Frodo and Samwise Gamgee, who are able to handle the Ring for extended periods of time. Hobbits are not totally immune to the Ring's effects, however, as shown by the changes it works in Frodo, Bilbo and Gollum. On the other hand, Boromir becomes obsessed with the Ring, but never possesses it, while Sm\u00e9agol kills his kin D\u00e9agol, the first Ring bearer after Isildur, to obtain it.  \nGollum and Saruman differ from the other characters in submitting willingly to an evil power; the effect, according to the scholar Patricia Spacks, is of gradual destruction, even when the character starts out mainly virtuous. Saruman's case shows, she writes, that \"pride and the lust for power\", as he strives to get the Ring and to be powerful like Sauron, are enough to destroy him even though he never gets the Ring. When Gandalf comes to the ruins of Isengard to meet Saruman, and offers him freedom in place of slavery to Sauron, Saruman is too thoroughly corrupted to be able to choose any longer. As for Gollum, he is \"a far more pitiable creature\" as the Ring has taken him from a basically amoral position to one of evil. When Frodo suggests Gollum is not totally evil, Faramir replies \"Not wholly, perhaps, but malice eats it like a canker, and the evil is growing\".  \n### Tolkien vs Plato  \nThe theme of a corrupting ring dates back to Plato's Republic, where the Ring of Gyges gave invisibility and thus the ability to get away with crime.2009  \nThe philosopher Eric Katz, however writes that \"Plato argues that such moral corruption will occur, but Tolkien shows us this corruption through the thoughts and actions of his characters\"; Plato tries to counter the \"cynical conclusion\" that moral life is chosen by the weak; Glaucon thinks that people are only \"good\" because they suppose they will be caught if they are not. Plato argues that immoral life is no good as it corrupts one's soul. So, Katz states, according to Plato a moral person has peace and happiness, and would not use a Ring of Power. Katz writes that Tolkien's story \"demonstrates various responses to the question posed by Plato: would a just person be corrupted by the possibility of almost unlimited power?\" The question is answered in different ways: Gollum is weak, corrupted, and finally destroyed; Boromir begins virtuous but like Plato's Gyges is corrupted \"by the temptation of power\" from the Ring, even if he wants to use it for good, but redeems himself by defending the hobbits to his own death; the \"strong and virtuous\" Galadriel, who sees clearly what she would become if she accepted the ring, and rejects it; the immortal Tom Bombadil, exempt from the Ring's corrupting power and from its gift of invisibility; Sam who in a moment of need faithfully uses the ring, but is not seduced by its vision of \"Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age\"; and finally Frodo who is gradually corrupted, but is saved by his earlier mercy to Gollum, and Gollum's desperation for the Ring. Katz concludes that Tolkien's answer to Plato's \"Why be moral?\" is \"to be yourself\".  \n## Addiction  \n### \"Power corrupts\"  \n<ImageHere>Lord Acton famously stated \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\", an idea embodied in the addictive power of the One Ring.\nThe corrupting effect of power is, according to Shippey, a modern theme, since in earlier times, power was considered to \"reveal character\", not alter it. Shippey quotes Lord Acton's 1887 statement:  \nShippey points out authors contemporary with Tolkien who dealt in the theme of the corrupting influence of power: George Orwell with Animal Farm (1945), William Golding with Lord of the Flies (1954), and T. H. White with The Once and Future King (1958). In his view, this was largely a modern idea; he writes that the nearest medieval equivalent is the Old English proverb \"man de\u00fe swa he by\u00fe \u00feonne he mot swa he wile\": \"A man does as he is when he can do what he wants\", i.e. power reveals existing character, rather than changing it for the worse. The Lord of the Rings is largely medieval in its setting, but its attitude to the corrupting effect of power is an anachronism, something wholly modern. He sees a modern echo, too, in Boromir's response to the Ring, with \"all the signals which the twentieth century has learned to distrust\", including fascination with power even if it is the Enemy's; his speech  praising \"the fearless\" and then \"the ruthless\" as the way to victory; the portrayal of himself as a leader with \"power of Command\"; and eventually \"the naked appeal to force\".  \nThe Tolkien scholars Agnes Perkins and Helen Hill, writing in A Tolkien Compass, analyse the corrupting effect of power. They pay particular attention to the Ring, but point out that the issue is wider than that, as some characters were corrupted long before the Rings were forged. They view Tolkien's scheme as having five groups of three characters, each affected differently by power.\n\n### A single explanation  \nThe literary critic Colin Manlove criticises Tolkien's attitude towards power as inconsistent, with exceptions to the supposedly overwhelming influence of the Ring. The Ring can be handed over relatively easily (Sam and Bilbo), and removing the Ring by force (Gollum to Frodo) does not, despite Gandalf's assertion at the beginning of the story, break Frodo's mind. The Ring also appears to have little effect on characters such as Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Shippey notes that, despite Manlove, Tolkien is fair in showing a regular pattern of \"creeping corruption\": Bilbo becomes angry when Gandalf tries to coax him to give up the Ring, and is seen as \"a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands\" when he asks Frodo to let him look at the Ring just one more time; Isildur uses Gollum-like words with \"It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain\"; there is Gollum's corrupted state throughout the story; and there are the ominous signals from Boromir. Shippey replies to Manlove's doubt with \"one word\": addictive. He writes that this sums up Gandalf's whole argument, as in the early stages, as with Bilbo and Sam, the addiction can be shaken off easily enough, while for those who are not yet addicted, as with Aragorn and indeed others like Galadriel and Faramir, its pull is like any other temptation. What Gandalf could not do to Frodo, Shippey writes, is make him want to hand the Ring over. And for the owner of the Ring, the destructive aspect is the urge to use it, no matter how good the intentions of the owner might be at the start. Katz writes that \"it is clear that Tolkien is demonstrating to us the progressive forces of corruption of the possession and use of the One Ring\"; usage may begin innocently or accidentally, but \"its seductive power\" gradually wears down any resistance.  \nOther critics, too, have described the Ring as addictive, with each use progressively increasing the hold the Ring has over its bearer. Bilbo, while possessing the Ring for some time, is able to give it away willingly, though with considerable difficulty. Later, when he encounters the Ring in Rivendell, he experiences a powerful longing to hold it again. Frodo also shows features of addiction, ultimately becoming unable to relinquish the Ring of his own accord.  \nIn Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the effects of the Ring on Bilbo and Frodo are obsessions that have been compared with drug addiction; the actor Andy Serkis, who played Gollum, cited drug addiction as an inspiration for his performance. Critical theory scholar Douglas Kellner, examining the question of whether the work is an allegory despite Tolkien's statement to the contrary, writes that Gollum serves as \"a cautionary warning as to what obsession with the Ring and addiction to power can do to someone. In deprivation, he craves his 'precious' talisman of power, although he knows its destructive force. The film presents a parable of addiction, as Gollum is torn apart by his need for the destructive substance\".  \n### Revealing each character's morality  \nKatz argues that Tolkien uses the device of the Ring and its addictive power to reveal each character's morality in turn. The extreme case is Sm\u00e9agol, whose addiction to the Ring becomes more pronounced as, over 500 years, he is wholly overcome by its power. He is transformed into the monstrous creature Gollum, showing traits ranging from withdrawal and isolation to suspicion and anger towards others; his obsession with the Ring leads to his demise. Eventually he is \"utterly destroyed\" by the pull of the Ring.  \n### Overcoming the addiction  \nThe Tolkien scholar Patrick Curry writes that Tolkien's narrative is not limited to \"a single, all-consuming crisis: the War of the Ring dominates, but is not absolutely everything\", and furthermore \"Nor is the end of the Ring a purely voluntary, willed and idealistic renunciation\": the addiction is not broken by a single choice. Instead, he argues, that is brought about by \"countless acts of courage, kindness and help, both small and great, from unknown people and forces, in unforeseen circumstances, that together provide an opportunity to do the right thing.\" That in turn is accompanied by \"a commitment to the simple good things of life \u2013 food, water, green and growing things\", making \"an appreciation of life itself, at once natural and spiritual\" the value that succeeds. Curry sees this as offering hope in the real world, and the principal message of Tolkien's writings.  \nCurry cites the moment when Sam is saved from the Ring's temptation:  \nSaruman, a Wizard not a warrior, expresses the temptation to Gandalf, in the hope of persuading him, as \"Knowledge, Rule, Order\". The Episcopal priest and Tolkien scholar Fleming Rutledge writes that Saruman's triad is capitalised \"as though they were Powers. They sound oppressive, like Nazi slogans ... in the German fashion\". She notes the half-elf Elrond's description of the lust for power: \"strength, domination, and hoarded wealth\", which Elrond contrasts with another triad, \"understanding, making, and healing\". She explains that these \"softer, gentler\" things are \"more powerful than any conventional weapons\".\n\nQuestion: Which statement best reflects the theme common to both the representation of the One Ring and the idea expressed by Lord Acton?\nChoice list: \nA.

Since all LPC bootloaders support loading from the UART peripheral and most boards connect a UART to RS-232 or a USB-to-UART adapter IC, thus it's a universal method to program the LPC microcontrollers. Some microcontrollers requires the target board to have a way to enable/disable booting from the ROM'ed bootloader (i.e. jumper / switch / button).  \n* lpc21isp A multi-platform open-source tool to flash LPC microcontrollers over the UART.  \n* Flash Magic, a commercial program for Windows and macOS to perform in-system programming of the LPC flash via its UART.  \n* nxp_isp_loader, an open-source tool to flash LPC microcontrollers over the UART.  \nDebugging tools (JTAG / SWD)  \n* OpenOCD, an open source software package for JTAG access using a wide variety of hardware adapters.  \n* LPC-Link 2, by NXP, a JTAG / SWD debug adapter that has multiple firmware releases available to emulate popular debug adapter protocols, such as: J-Link by Segger, CMSIS-DAP by ARM, Redlink by Code Red Technologies. All connectors are 1.27\u00a0mm (0.05-inch) pitch.  \n## Documentation  \nThe amount of documentation for all ARM chips is daunting, especially for newcomers.  The documentation for microcontrollers from past decades would easily be inclusive in a single document, but as chips have evolved so has the documentation grown.  The total documentation is especially hard to grasp for all ARM chips since it consists of documents from the IC manufacturer (NXP Semiconductors) and documents from CPU core vendor (ARM Holdings).  \nA typical top-down documentation tree is: manufacturer website, manufacturer marketing slides, manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip, manufacturer detailed reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family, ARM core generic user guide, ARM core technical reference manual, ARM architecture reference manual that describes the instruction set(s).  \nNXP documentation tree (top to bottom):  \n-  NXP website.  \n-  NXP marketing slides.  \n-  NXP datasheet.  \n-  NXP reference manual.  \n-  ARM core website.  \n-  ARM core generic user guide.  \n-  ARM core technical reference manual.  \n-  ARM architecture reference manual.  \nNXP has additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

Number 7 is a specimen of Calommata transvaalica, a spider from the Blouberg\n\n<ImageHere>NASA picture of the Blouberg (dark shape, middle right) and the pale Makgabeng Plateau directly to the south of it\nThe Blouberg (formerly \"Blaauwberg\"), meaning \"Blue Mountain\" in Dutch, is a range of mountains in the Limpopo Province, at the far north of South Africa. It is located in Blouberg Local Municipality, Capricorn District. The mountain is entrenched in the history of the local Northern Sotho people, and they have different names for its various parts.  \nThe Blouberg forms part of the 'Vhembe Biosphere Reserve', named a biosphere reserve by UNESCO since 2009. This reserve also includes the neighboring Makgabeng Plateau, the Soutpansberg, the northern part of the Kruger National Park, the Makuleke Wetlands and the Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape. The eastern and part of the central Blouberg prominences are enclosed and protected as part of the Blouberg Nature Reserve. A 4x4 track traverses Rapanyan's Neck, the defile that separates these easterly subranges.\n\n## Setting  \nThis rocky mountain range rises over a plateau averaging 900 m to the west of the western end of the Soutpansberg range. The Blouberg is topped by massive rocky outcrops resembling castles or fortifications with sheer walls. Its highest point reaches 2,040 m above sea level and is also the highest point of the entire Soutpansberg/Blouberg system.  \nThe Brak River (also known as Hout River), a tributary of the Sand River, flows diagonally along the southeastern edge of the Blouberg, separating it from the Soutpansberg further east. Although these two  ranges are clearly destinguishable from a geographical point of view, geologically the Blouberg forms part of the Soutpansberg.  \n## Human population  \nAbout 117 settlements in its foothills are home to some 161,000 inhabitants, belonging to the Bahananwa nation. Senwabarwana, the economic centre of these villages, is visited by many to do their shopping. During the 19th century they were incorporated into the South African Republic, and the homeland system was introduced during the Apartheid era of the 20th century. Basic infrastructure and developmental needs were neglected, and in the 21st century it remains one of Limpopo's most underdeveloped regions. Many villages experience high unemployment rates, severe poverty or low levels of income despite the area's natural resources. Their isolation is mitigated by their sense of community and connectivity to each other.  \n## Ecology  \nThe vegetation of the Blouberg ranges from sub-tropical veld or savanna at the base, to a type of Afro-montane vegetation related to the Cape Fynbos near the summits. The rocky cliffs are a haven for birds of prey such as the Cape vultures.  \nThe Blouberg, like its larger neighbor further east, the Soutpansberg, is known for a high level of endemism of its invertebrate fauna, such as the Swanepoel's widow butterfly that is found on the southern slopes of the range. The Waterberg flat lizard and a subspecies of the common flat lizard are found in this range.  \n## Rock climbing  \nThe Blouberg is one of the most spectacular rock climbing areas in South Africa. As a rock climbing destination it is famous for its sheer 350\u00a0m \"Moonshadow\" wall. Most of the climbing spots are on private land but climbers can make arrangements to access them through the Alldays Mountain Club in nearby Alldays, Limpopo.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts the specimen of Calommata transvaalica, a spider from the Blouberg?\nChoice list: \nA.

He was born in Nancy and died in Paris.\n\n## Life  \nThe Adam family home in Nancy  \nAdam was the youngest of the three sons of the sculptor Jacob Sigisbert Adam of Nancy. His brothers Lambert-Sigisbert Adam and Fran\u00e7ois Gaspard Adam were also sculptors.  \nIn 1757, Adam married Christine Lenoir, the daughter of a goldsmith in Nancy. They had two sons, the painter Jean Charles Nicolas Adam and the sculptor Gaspard Louis Adam.  \nNicolas Adam was blind when he died in 1778 in Paris.  \n## Career  \nAdam studied first with his father, then with his elder brother Lambert, at the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture). He failed to obtain the prix de Rome, but did receive funding to travel to Italy. Along the way, he stopped to work on the ornamental fa\u00e7ade of the Ch\u00e2teau de la Mosson at Juvignac, near Montpellier, spending 18 months on the project. He finally arrived in Rome in 1726. His brother introduced him to the cardinal Melchior de Polignac, for whom he restored a number of ancient marbles.  \nAdam returned to Paris in 1734, working in his elder brother's atelier. Soon he began to receive a number of commissions. With his brother, he worked on Le Triomphe de Neptune et d'Amphitrite (\"The Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite,\" completed 1740), the large sculpture group in lead for the Neptune fountain at the Palace of Versailles.  \nDuring the same period, he worked for the Rohan family at the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, sculpting bas-reliefs for Amours des Dieux (\"The Gods' Love Affairs\", 1736) in the state chamber of the Princess. The B\u00e2timents du Roi commissioned him for work at the Courts of Accounts in Paris, at the Basilica of St. Denis, and on the royal chapel at Versailles. At the abbey he created a bas-relief Saint Maur Seeking the Aid of the Lord for the Healing of a Child. The fathers at the Oratory of Paris entrusted him with the decoration of the church portal.  \nPrometheus Bound (1762), Adam's reception piece for the Academy  \nHis reception piece for the Academy in 1762 was Prometheus Bound (French Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e encha\u00een\u00e9) considered one of the masterpieces of 18th-century sculpture. His most notable work, however, is the funeral monument of the queen Catherine Opali\u0144ska, wife of Stanislas Leszczy\u0144ski, at the Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours church in Nancy. It depicts the deceased kneeling, with her hands joined in an attitude of prayer. An angel takes her by the hand to guide her to Heaven. The base is of black marble. Executed with great elegance, the group is regarded as one of the most remarkable and genuinely moving funeral monuments of the 18th century.  \nNicolas Adam, like his brother Lambert, was influenced by the Italian Baroque. He ranks with him as one of the most refined and subtle sculptors of his time. He was a major influence on his nephew, the sculptor Clodion.  \n## Selected works  \n<ImageHere>Religion Instructing an Indian (1745), expressing the colonialist attitudes of 18th-century Europe\n* Nymph  (c. 1723), bas-relief in the pediment of the great hall, and berry ornamentation on the ground floor of the Ch\u00e2teau de la Mosson, Juvignac  \n* The Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite (1735 - 1740), lead sculpture for the fountain at Versailles, in collaboration with his brother Lambert Sigisbert Adam  \n* Les Amours des Dieux (\"Love Affairs of the Gods,\" 1736), stucco relief, H\u00f4tel de Soubise, Paris, the chamber of the Princess  image  \n* L'Automne (\"Autumn,\" 1745), marble vase, originally created for the grounds at the Ch\u00e2teau de Choisy, now in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art  \n* Religion Instructing an Indian (1745), marble statue group, church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, Paris  \n* The Martyrdom of Saint Victoria (1747), bronze relief, bronze, royal chapel at Versailles  \n* Funeral monument of the queen Catherine Opali\u0144ska (1749), marble and bronze, Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours at Nancy, France  \n* A series of narrative reliefs on Apollo: Apollo et Daphne, Latona and the Farmers, Apollo and the Sibyl, Apollo and Coronis (c. 1753), bas-reliefs for the H\u00f4tel de la Bou\u00ebxi\u00e8re in Paris, Ch\u00e2teau de Bagatelle et Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet  \n* Angelica and Medoro from Orlando Furioso, a marble statue group along with Apollo and Diana, originally created for the H\u00f4tel de Choiseul in Paris, now in the Museum of Amiens  \n* Prometheus Bound (1762), a marble sculpture group at the Louvre  \n* Iris Putting on Her Wings (1775\u201376), a marble statue finished by his nephew Clodion, Versailles\n\n\nQuestion: Which work was created by Nicolas-S\u00e9bastien Adam, also known as \"Adam the Younger\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Micro-atmosphere method  \n<ImageHere>Streak plates of several bacterial species on nutrient agar plates\nThe micro-atmosphere method is an antimicrobial testing method involving the use of potentially bacteriostatic or fungicidal compounds which are obtained from the volatile oils of plants, such as citronella grass. This method involves the use of essential oils, a growth medium, a selection of bacterial or cultures and an incubator.\n\n## Method  \nIn this microbiological procedure, theoretically, the antibacterial or anti-fungal activity of the volatile oils from a chosen plant may be tested against a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria or a species of fungus. The growth of the bacteria or fungi are then monitored on a timely basis to measure the bacteriostatic or anti-fungal activity of the volatile oils. In some cases, a complete inhibition of growth for the bacteria tested can be observed.  \n## Dilution of essential oils  \nBefore it can be tested, the essential oils are first diluted to produce solutions of varying concentrations. In this way, the minimum inhibitory concentration can be calculated to obtain the most cost-effective antimicrobial agent.  \n## Antibacterial activity  \nUntil recently, the antibacterial activity of essential oils has been primarily evaluated through direct contact methods between the pathogen and the antimicrobial agent through diffusion and dilution methods, however the role of essential oils in the vapour phase as antimicrobial agents is gaining increasing significance.  \nThis method was developed on the premise that essential oil vapours exert critical biological activity. These methods offer rapid screening protocols for the antimicrobial assessment of plant essential oils. It has been suggested that essential oils in the vapour phase possess the greatest degree of antimicrobial activity since the active constituents are highly volatile in nature and thus, the vapour is therefore the contributing attribute for its biological activity. Each individual constituent has differing volatility, therefore when the mixtures are introduced into a free, non-saturated state in a closed micro-environment; the volatile constituents begin to disperse at differing rates in the vapour phase within the headspace according to their degree of volatility until they reach equilibrium.  \nPreliminary research involving the essential oils of citronella yielded promising results when tested against a selection of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. The use of such extracts can be explored especially in the development of cost-effective treatments of respiratory illness, specifically of those caused by bacterial or fungal infection. Preliminary tests exhibit complete inhibition of the growth of certain bacterial strains.  \n## Anti-fungal activity  \n<ImageHere>Kirby\u2013Bauer testing: White wafers containing antibiotics shown on plate of bacteria. Circles of poor bacterial growth surround some wafers, indicating susceptibility to the antibiotic\nIn a separate research, the micro-atmosphere method was used to investigate the anti-fungal efficacy of the essential oils from the cinnamon, a plant belonging to the genus Cinnamomum.  \nThe procedure was employed to ensure that the active films, the material containing the active compound, does not come into direct contact to the tested fungal suspension.  \nThe micro-atmosphere method was performed, in order to evaluate the indirect effects of active films against P. digitatum. Addition of 0.5% cinnamon essential oil, led to 12% inhibition of fungal growth. Higher anti-fungal effects were obtained by adding higher amounts of the essential oil. An inhibition of fungal growth between 28% and 50% were observed for the films incorporated with 1.5% and 3% essential oil, respectively.  \nIn this particular research, the potential anti-fungal agent was subjected to both disk diffusion test and the micro-atmosphere method for comparison and to get an idea of how the active compound may be utilized. The active compound exhibited higher anti-fungal effects in the disc diffusion test compared to the micro-atmosphere assays. This could be attributed to the fact that in the disc diffusion test, both direct contact and migration of active compounds from the film to the outside induced the observed antimicrobial effects. On the other hand, only the migration of the volatile compounds to the headspace, may cause the anti-fungal effect in the micro-atmosphere method.\n\n\nQuestion: Which method is depicted in Image 2 for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics?\nChoice list: \nA.

As Jey attempted to adorn Zayn with the tribal garland, Reigns intervened and the Bloodline then delivered a beatdown to Owens, with The Usos and Sikoa doing the damage while Zayn was watching. Heyman handed two pairs of handcuffs to Reigns and The Usos handcuffed both arms of Owens to the ropes. After The Usos viciously attacked Owens with superkicks, Reigns attempted to strike a fallen Owens with a chair, however, Zayn intervened and told Reigns that Owens had enough, and such a savage attack was beneath someone of Reigns' status. Reigns then handed the chair to Zayn, instructing him to strike Owens to prove his loyalty to The Bloodline. Zayn hesitated, and Reigns then began berating Zayn, pointing out how much Reigns and The Bloodline had done for Zayn in elevating his career. A conflicted Zayn then attacked Reigns with the chair, which prompted the entire Bloodline (except Jey, who had taken a liking to Zayn and was emotionally conflicted by what he just witnessed) to beat down Zayn. Jey left the ring and Zayn was removed from the Bloodline, turning Zayn face for the first time since 2017. Reigns, Jimmy, Sikoa, and Heyman headed up the entrance aisle while Owens and Zayn were laid out in the ring as the event came to an end.\n\n## Reception  \nThe 2023 Royal Rumble was a financial success for WWE. The company reported that it was the biggest gate in Royal Rumble history, garnering more than US$7.7 million, more than 50% than the previous record set by the 2017 event. It also had a 52% increase in viewership over the previous record set by the 2022 event. Additionally, the 2023 event broke all-time venue merchandise and sponsorship records, with merchandise sales up 135% over the record set in 2022, and sponsorship revenue was up nearly 200% over 2022. Sponsorships included Mountain Dew for the Pitch Black match and Applebee's for the countdown clock. The final segment featuring The Bloodline, particularly between Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn, generated over 20 million views across all of WWE's social media platforms. Dave Meltzer reported the Mountain Dew sponsorship was for 1 million dollars.  \nWWE reported an attendance of 51,338, though a report by Wrestlenomics said according to a public records request with the City of San Antonio (which operates the Alamodome), the company sold 44,569 tickets for the event, and that he number of tickets scanned and entered was 42,928.  \nDave Meltzer gave star ratings for each match of the night. The lowest rated match was Bray Wyatt vs. LA Knight, which received 0.75 stars, the Raw Women's Championship match received 1.5 stars, the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match and the women's Royal Rumble match both received 3.5 stars, and the men's Royal Rumble match received 4.25 stars, the highest rated match of the night.  \nBrent Brookhouse of CBS Sports gave praise to the main event, giving it a grade of A+, stating that \"there was so much to dig into in that match\". He also stated that the best moment of the aftermath of the match was Jey Uso's walkout, which \"established the pecking order of The Bloodline\", and also called it \"a full circle moment dating back to the group's origins and Jey Uso's feud with Reigns in 2020\". Wade Keller of Pro Wrestling Torch gave the match 4 stars out of 5, and that the angle was \"phenomenal\" with a \"perfect crowd response\". Brandon LeClair, also from Pro Wrestling Torch, praised Sami Zayn's betrayal of The Bloodline. He said that it was \"unbelievable\" while also stating that it \"certainly leads to that old cliche\". LeClair said that \"the crowd's reaction to Sami delivering the chair shot to Reigns provides any necessary proof that this has been wildly successful\", and \"the crowd was nearly as enthralled by an emotional Jey Uso walking out on his family, seemingly siding with Zayn\". Chris Mueller of Bleacher Report gave the match itself a grade of B, stating that the match \"was a bit too predictable\", but gave the post-match grade an A+, stating that this \"was what everybody actually came to see\".  \n## Aftermath  \nDuring the 2023 WWE Draft, the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship changed brands. They were later renamed WWE Women's Championship and Women's World Championship, respectively.  \n### Raw  \nMen's Royal Rumble match winner Cody Rhodes opened the following episode of Raw, setting his sights on Roman Reigns and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 39. Afterwards, he was interrupted by The Judgment Day (Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio, and Finn B\u00e1lor). After they mocked Rhodes' Rumble win, Edge appeared and attacked The Judgment Day. A match between B\u00e1lor and Rhodes was later scheduled for that episode's main event. During the match, The Judgment Day tried to help B\u00e1lor win, but Edge evened the odds, only to be attacked by Rhea Ripley. However, Beth Phoenix took care of Ripley, allowing Rhodes to win the match. The following week, Edge and Phoenix challenged B\u00e1lor and Ripley to a mixed tag team match at Elimination Chamber, which B\u00e1lor accepted.  \nAlso, on Raw, women's Royal Rumble match winner Rhea Ripley announced that she would challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania 39. This in turn left the Raw Women's Champion without a WrestleMania opponent. As such, WWE official Adam Pearce announced that at Elimination Chamber, there would be an Elimination Chamber match with three wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown each with the winner earning a Raw Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 39. The four Royal Rumble runner ups were automatically added to the match: Asuka and Nikki Cross from Raw and Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan from SmackDown. Asuka won the match to become the number one contender for the title at WrestleMania 39.  \nBayley talked about eliminating Becky Lynch in the women's Royal Rumble match, only for Lynch to interrupt. After the two talked about their history, Lynch challenged Bayley to a Steel Cage match for the following week, but Bayley rejected. However, when Lynch brought Dakota Kai, whose ankle was wrapped around a chair, to the stage and threatened to stomp on the chair, Bayley accepted the challenge. During the match, Bayley was about to win after interference from Damage CTRL (Kai and Iyo Sky), but a returning Lita took out Kai and Sky, and helped Lynch defeat Bayley. Two weeks later, Lita and Lynch challenged Kai and Sky for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship and defeated them on the February 27 episode to win the titles thanks to a returning Trish Stratus taking out Bayley, who tried interfering. The following week, Stratus, who had retired at SummerSlam in 2019, said she was coming out of retirement so that she, Lynch, and Lita could challenge Damage CTRL to a six-woman tag team match at WrestleMania 39, and Damage CTRL accepted.  \nOn the February 6 episode of Raw, Brock Lesnar appeared with a match contract and challenged Bobby Lashley to another match at Elimination Chamber. Lashley came out and said he would give him an answer later on after reviewing the contract. Lesnar then attacked Lashley with two F-5s. An official contract signing for a match at Elimination Chamber took place the following week, and after Lashley laid out Lesnar, he signed the contract to make the match official.  \nAfter the Royal Rumble, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins began bad mouthing Logan Paul in interviews, stating that he did not want Paul to be in wrestling. At Elimination Chamber during the titular match, Paul snuck into the chamber and attacked Rollins, costing him the United States Championship. During the February 27 episode of Raw, Rollins called out Paul to meet him face-to-face on the following episode, and Paul accepted. There, Rollins wanted to fight, but Paul said he would not fight for free and hinted that they could fight at WrestleMania 39. WrestleMania host The Miz said he could make the match official, and it was later confirmed.  \n### SmackDown  \nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns (with Paul Heyman) talked about Sami Zayn's contributions to The Bloodline, but thought he saw greed in Zayn. Reigns then stated that Zayn used his island of relevancy. Afterwards, Zayn attacked Reigns from behind, and performed his own Spear on Reigns, only for Reigns to retreat. Zayn then challenged Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, but was attacked by Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa (Jey Uso was absent for the episode). Reigns prevented Sikoa from doing further damage to Zayn, and accepted Zayn's challenge, stating that since Zayn hurt his family, he would hurt Zayn in front of his own family in Montreal at Elimination Chamber. After Reigns retained against Zayn, Kevin Owens prevented The Bloodline (except Jey) from doing further damage to Zayn. After more weeks of feuding, including Jey turning on Zayn, Owens saved Zayn from an attack by The Usos on the March 17 episode of SmackDown, and the two embraced. It was then confirmed that Owens and Zayn would face The Usos for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 39.  \nWith women's Royal Rumble match winner Rhea Ripley choosing to challenge for the SmackDown Women's Championship, The Judgment Day (Ripley, Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio, and Finn B\u00e1lor) began appearing on SmackDown, thus Dominik began tormenting his dad, Rey, again. After weeks of Rey refusing to attack Dominik, on the March 24 episode of SmackDown, Dominik disrespected his mother and sister, forcing Rey to intervene and hit Dominik. It was then confirmed that Rey and Dominik would face each other at WrestleMania 39. During this time, Ripley and Liv Morgan had a match on the March 3 episode, where Ripley was victorious.  \nAfter the Royal Rumble, Bray Wyatt was to begin a WrestleMania program with Bobby Lashley. However, these plans were dropped as he was taken off television in late February due to an undisclosed illness. On August 19, it was reported that the illness was life-threatening, but he was making positive progress towards a return. However, just five days later on August 24, Wyatt unexpectedly died of a heart attack. It was also revealed that the illness was COVID-19, which had exacerbated an existing heart issue. The 2023 Royal Rumble would in turn be his final televised match. His final overall match was at a WWE Live event on February 26, where he defeated LA Knight in a rematch.  \n## Results  \n### Men's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations  \nborder=silver \u2013 Raw  \nborder=silver \u2013 SmackDown  \nborder=silver \u2013 NXT  \nborder=silver \u2013 Unaffiliated  \nborder=silver \u2013 Winner  \n(HOF) \u2013 WWE Hall of Famer (at the time of the match)  \n### Women's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations  \nborder=silver \u2013 Raw  \nborder=silver \u2013 SmackDown  \nborder=silver \u2013 NXT  \nborder=silver \u2013 Unaffiliated  \nborder=silver \u2013 Winner\n\nQuestion: Which event took place at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, in January 2023, as shown in the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# 1124 papal election  \nThe 1124 papal election (held 16\u201321 December) took place after the death of Pope Callixtus II on 13 December 1124. The election was characterised by a power struggle between Italian cardinals supported by the Pierleoni family and northern cardinals supported by the Frangipani family. On 16 December the cardinals elected Theobaldo Boccapecci, the cardinal-priest of Sant'Anastasia. He chose the name Celestine II. Before his consecration, however, an armed party of the Frangipani attacked and wounded the newly elected pope. In the following confusion the Bishop of Ostia Lamberto Scannabecchi, the Frangipani's candidate was proclaimed pope under the name Honorius II. After several days of factional fighting Celestine was abandoned by his supporters. However, Honorius would not accept the throne in this manner and resigned as well. He was immediately re-elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124.  \n## Background  \nPressures building within the Curia, together with ongoing conflicts among the Roman nobility, would erupt after the death of Pope Callixtus II in 1124. The pontificates of Urban II and Paschal II had seen an expansion in the College of Cardinals of Italian clerics that strengthened the local Roman influence. These cardinals were reluctant to meet with the group of cardinals recently promoted by Callixtus II, who were mainly French or Burgundian. As far as the older cardinals were concerned, these newer cardinals were dangerous innovators, and they were determined to resist their increasing influence. The northern cardinals, led by Cardinal Aymeric de Bourgogne (the Papal Chancellor), were equally determined to ensure that the elected pope would be one of their candidates. Both groups looked towards the great Roman families for support.  \n<ImageHere>Plan of the medieval Lateran Basilica, with the Monastery of Saint Pancratius at upper right (south).\n\n<ImageHere>The area of medieval Rome controlled by the Frangipani family\nBy 1124, there were two great factions dominating local politics in Rome: the Frangipani family, which controlled the region around the fortified Colosseum and supported the northern cardinals, and the Pierleoni family, which controlled the Tiber Island and the fortress of the Theatre of Marcellus and supported the Italian cardinals.  With Callixtus II's death on 13 December 1124, both families agreed that the election of the next pope should be in three days time, in accordance with the church canons. The Frangipani, led by Leo Frangipani, pushed for a delay in order that they could promote their preferred candidate, Lamberto, but the people were eager to see Saxo de Anagni, the Cardinal-Priest of San Stefano in Celiomonte elected as the next pope. Leo, eager to ensure a valid election, approached key members of every Cardinal's entourage, promising each one that he would support their master when the voting for the election was underway.\n\n## Election  \nOn 16 December, the Cardinals, including Lamberto, assembled in the chapel of the monastery of St. Pancratius attached to the south of the Lateran basilica. There, at the suggestion of Jonathas, the cardinal-deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano, who was a partisan of the Pierleoni family, the Cardinals unanimously elected as Pope the cardinal-priest of Sant\u2019 Anastasia, Theobaldo Boccapecci, who took the name Celestine II. He had only just put on the red mantle and the Te Deum was being sung when an armed party led by Roberto Frangipani (in a move pre-arranged with Cardinal Aymeric) burst in, attacked the newly enthroned Celestine, who was wounded, and acclaimed Lamberto as Pope. Since Celestine had not been formally consecrated pope, the wounded candidate declared himself willing to resign, but the Pierleoni family and their supporters refused to accept Lamberto, who in the confusion had been proclaimed Pope under the name Honorius II. Historians call the election \"a travesty of canonical procedure\".  \nRome descended into factional infighting, while Cardinal Aymeric and Leo Frangipani attempted to win over the resistance of Urban, the City Prefect, and the Pierleoni family with bribes and extravagant promises. Eventually, Celestine's supporters abandoned him, leaving Honorius the only contender for the papal throne. Honorius, unwilling to accept the throne in such a manner, resigned his position before the assembled Cardinals, but was immediately and unanimously re-elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124.  \n### Cardinals  \nThe College of Cardinals probably had between 47 and 53 members. Little information is available on which Cardinals were actually present in Rome during the election(s).  \nThe following table lists the Cardinals who were alive at the time of the electionrefn|Based on Adams and Miranda, who in turn cite other sources including Brixius, Jaff\u00e9, H\u00fcls, Klewitz, Stroll, Pandulf of Pisa and the Annuaire Pontifical Catholique 1928.  \n#### Absentee Cardinals\n\nQuestion: Which of the following structures is depicted in both Image 1 and Image 2?\nChoice list: \nA.

The aim was to enable rapid dissemination of Allied propaganda material by the use of German prisoners of war.  \nOriginal document of the OSS on the Sauerkraut missions  \n<ImageHere>Counterfeit NSDAP-party dues stamps\n\n<ImageHere>Propaganda flyer for Austria\nThe idea of utilizing German prisoners of war as agents arose after the failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler on July 20, 1944. By exploiting this unexpected psychological advantage, the deployment of apparently German soldiers in Wehrmacht uniforms was considered particularly suitable for indoctrinating the enemy without much delay.  \nIn a prisoner of war camp for Germans near Naples, efforts were made to recruit the first candidates for the mission. At the same time, suitable leaflets were developed which referred to the attempted coup on July 20 and were then to be smuggled into German territory. Thus, for example, it was claimed that Walther von Brauchitsch had taken over the command in Germany, or German troops were called upon to carry out revolutionary measures against the Nazi regime. An extra issue of the magazine Das Neue Deutschland was also produced, which pointed to alleged opposition groups within the German Reich.  \nAfter initially selecting 16 trustworthy prisoners of war, they were first transported to Rome to be equipped accordingly. This included German Wehrmacht uniforms, forged documents, weapons and compasses. Money in Italian currency, cigarettes and first aid equipment were also included. In small groups they were then smuggled across the river Arno. They were to penetrate as deeply as possible behind the German lines and spread the propaganda material they had been given. For example, leaflets and magazines were to be placed on trees, in cars, in buildings and on roads.  \nFlyer deliberately printed in  coarse quality  \nVarious gummed labels, often carried and distributed by agents  \nOf particular importance were the forged documents that were given to the agents. Since the German side was constantly changing certain recognition features for security reasons, the US side had to regularly improve them, which apparently succeeded brilliantly. Although agents of the operation were later reportedly checked by German military police on several occasions, there was only one case in which such an agent was exposed. While the forged documents had to look as perfect as possible - and this included forged party books along with the party fee stamps - the propaganda material provided was deliberately printed in a much coarser quality. This was to avoid the impression that the stickers, leaflets or magazines were material produced abroad by the enemy using high-quality printing presses.  \nIn total, about 13 missions of Operation Sauerkraut were carried out. For this purpose, small groups were smuggled behind the German lines from July 25, 1944, until at least March 21, 1945.  \nSince international law prohibits deliberately placing prisoners of war in dangerous situations, all Operation Sauerkraut personnel had to sign a declaration certifying their voluntary participation. US lawyers considered this procedure to be indispensable in the event that after the war legal action was taken against the US Army before an international court. Although the German agents of Operation Sauerkraut were promised preferential treatment for their services by the U.S. side, they were merely returned to the regular POW camps after their deployment. There they were shunned by fellow prisoners of war to the knowledge of their agent activities and despised as traitors.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following items was deliberately printed in coarse quality to avoid the impression that it was produced abroad by the enemy using high-quality printing presses during World War II?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\n<ImageHere>Curtiss-Wright CW-C-14R, mainstay of the Fuerza Aerea Nacional de Bolivia during the Chaco war, in flight\nAlthough the Bolivian C-14R Ospreys were the most widely used aircraft on either side in Chaco war, additional airframes were anticipated but were never delivered. The Ospreys that were delivered to Bolivia arrived in three batches, of 12, 6 and 3 aircraft, with the last aircraft in the third batch being seized by Chilean customs officers due to an embargo imposed by the United States. This had the effect of also cancelling a fourth order of 6 aircraft. The eventual whereabouts of the seized aircraft is unknown. Random serial numbers were assigned to all but the first couple of aircraft, which were lost in accidents before numbers could be assigned. Shortly after the last examples had been made operational, The Air Force reorganized its aircraft into units that were named for their most important type \u2013 and so the Osprey escuadrilla was formed.  \nThe first operational flight was made on 2 January 1933 during the Bolivian attack on Nanawa, where they attacked Paraguayan troop concentrations, while the first aircraft to be shot down, by ground fire, during the war was an Osprey on 25 February 1933. The first air to air kill of the war was made in a Osprey by Rafael Pab\u00f3n over a Paraguayan Potez 25TOE, but he would in turn be killed when his Osprey was shot down in flames on 12 August 1934 near Fort Florida. The Bolivians would later name the Lieutenant Colonel Rafael Pab\u00f3n Airport in his honor.  \nAn attack by six Ospreys on Puerto Casado on 27 April 1933 triggered protests from the Argentine government \u2013 that were reiterated when a solo flight by single Osprey dropped homemade propaganda leaflets on Concepcion in Paraguay. Argentina was at that time maintaining a position of neutrality while supplying Paraguay with equipment, but would have posed a serious threat to the Bolivians had they declared war. As it was, despite pilots flying Ospreys providing ample warning of Paraguayan movements, Commander Hans Kundt's failure to act during the Campo V\u00eda pocket resulted in the greatest military defeat suffered by Bolivia, crippling their defences, and hastening the end of the war, to Paraguay's benefit.  \nBy the time of the armistice in June 1935, only three of the 20 were known to still be operational between accidents and combat losses. Two remained operational in January 1940, and a unfulfilled request was sent to the US authorities for spares in 1945. The last example was still shown on the books as late as 1954, albeit no longer airworthy.\n\n## Variants  \nData from Aerofiles, U.S. Civil Aircraft: Vol. 5,  \nand Curtiss Aircraft 1907-1947  \nCW-14C Travel Air: 1931 (ATC 2-357) prototype with hp Curtiss R-600 Challenger radial engine. 1 built, later converted into an A-14D  \nCW-A-14D Sportsman Deluxe: 1931 (ATC 442) hp Wright J-6-7 Whirlwind radial engine  \nCW-B-14B Speedwing: 1932 (ATC 485) with hp Wright R-975E radial engine  \nCW-B-14D Speedwing: 1 modified with hp Wright R-975-E radial engine  \nCW-B-14R (Racer): 1 built as a racer for Casey Lambert with hp Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind/SR-975 radial engine  \nCW-C-14B Osprey: 1932 Military CW-B-14B with hp Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind radial engine  \nCW-C-14R Osprey: hp Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind radial engine  \nCW-C-14B9 : Alternate designation for C-14R  \nCW-17R : Fighter development of Osprey, probably unbuilt.  \nCW-18D : Unbuilt primary trainer development of Osprey with detail changes to be powered by Wright R-760E.  \n## Operators  \n### Civil  \n* Casey Lambert had a B-14R that had been converted into a racer from a B-14B.  \n* Bureau of Air Commerce operated one CW-B-14B  \n* Curtiss Flying Service operated one CW-B-14B that was converted into a B14D.  \n* Union Oil Company operated two CW-A-14Ds  \n### Military  \n* Servicio de Aviacion Militar operated one CW-A14D Speedwing in the 1930s  \n* Fuerza Aerea Nacional de Bolivia and Fuerza Aerea Boliviana operated 20 CW-C-14R/C-14B-9 Bolivian Ospreys from 15 December 1933 to 1954  \n* Aviacion Militar operated at least three CW-14 Ospreys from December 1932 to 1939  \n* Fuerza Aerea del Ejercito Ecuatoriana operated two CW-14R Ospreys (sn 2014 & 2015) from August 1932 to 1936  \n* Fuerza Aerea Ejercito de Salvador operated three CW-14 Ospreys (sns 2033, 2034 & 2035) from August 1933 to 1942  \n* Sericio Aero Militar Venezolana operated two CW-14R Ospreys and one C-14B from August 1932 to 1938  \n## Surviving aircraft  \n<ImageHere>Curtiss-Wright CW-A-14-D NC12329 on display at the now defunct Virginia Aviation Museum\nFour surviving examples are currently on the US civil register \u2013 fully half of those that were registered in the US, although not all are likely to be in airworthy, or even displayable condition.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Joseph W. Herbert  \nJoseph W. Herbert in 1889  \nJoseph William Herbert (27 November 1863\u201318 February 1923) was a British-born American director, silent-film actor, singer and dramatist notable for being the first person to play Ko-Ko in America in a pirate production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado (1885) before joining D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring companies across America (1885\u20131890).  \n## Early career  \nHerbert was born in Liverpool in 1863 to Irish parents and emigrated to America in 1876 aged 13,  living in Chicago where, during his college days, he joined the local Church Choir Company as an amateur chorister. He deputised for a professional comedian who failed to show to play the Lord Chancellor in the company\u2019s production of Iolanthe and when C. D. Hess reformed the company as the Acme Opera Company and sent it on the road (1884) as a professional musical stock company, Herbert went with it. He subsequently played the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, Gobo in Les cloches de Corneville, appeared in Fatinitza, The Pirates of Penzance and Patience, played N\u00e9pomuc in La Grande-Duchesse de G\u00e9rolstein and Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, etc, through the tour and, following the Acme troupe\u2019s collapse, played with a stuck-together season of a stuck-together company in New Orleans.  \nHerbert was the first actor to play Ko-Ko in the United States, appearing in Sydney Rosenfeld's pirate production of The Mikado in Chicago in July 1885 before appearing in one performance (breaking a temporary injunction) in the same role at the Union Square Theatre in New York in July 1885, nearly a month before the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company arrived in America with the official production of The Mikado.  Herbert appeared as Ko-Ko for two weeks at the Union Square Theatre, opening on 17 August 1885 just two days before the D'Oyly Carte opened with their official production; Herbert and the rest of the cast then transferred to the Grand Opera House in Manhattan.  \n## D'Oyly Carte and other roles  \n<ImageHere>Sheet music cover for 'The Love-Lorn Lobster' (1897) sung by Sam Bernard with lyrics by Herbert and music by John Stromberg\nSuch was Herbert's success as Ko-Ko that he was engaged by Richard D'Oyly Carte and John Stetson to play the role in New York and New England with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's Third American Mikado Company, touring from November 1885 to May 1886. Again for Stetson Herbert played King Gama in Princess Ida from November to December 1886, and he appeared as Reginald Bunthorne in Patience during January 1887 in a D'Oyly Carte approved production in New York. He toured across North-East America for Stetson during the first half of 1887 in other D'Oyly Carte approved productions, again as King Gama in Princess Ida and later as Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore \u2013 this time in D'Oyly Carte's Second American Company.  In April 1887 he transferred to D'Oyly Carte's Third American Ruddigore Company, playing Sir Despard Murgatroyd; for a short period in early May 1887 he again played Robin Oakapple in New York.  \nHerbert played Sosoriki in the musical comedy The Pearl of Pekin (1888 and 1889); he made his last appearance with D'Oyly Carte in March 1890 when he briefly took over from Henry Lytton as the Duke of Plaza-Toro in D'Oyly Carte's recast production of The Gondoliers at Palmer's Theatre in New York; he played Mr. Auguste Pompier in the musical The Girl From Paris (1896) at the Herald Square Theatre; Count Berezowski in the operetta The Fortune Teller at Wallack's Theatre (1898); Prince Pumpernickel in the comic opera The Singing Girl (1899\u20131900); in the musical comedy The Rounders (1900); Maurice de Champignon in the musical comedy The Little Duchess (1901\u20131902); Damon Marigold in the musical comedy Sally in Our Alley (1902); Michael Dooley in the musical The Street Singer (1904); Washington Graft in The West Point Cadet (1904); The Duke of Toxen in It Happened in Nordland (1904\u20131905); Captain Carmona in Mexicana (1906); The Laird O'Finnan Haddock in his own About Town alongside his son, Joseph W Herbert Jr. (1906); Marquis d'Aucuneterre in Baron Trenck (1912); Count Buzot in Oh, I Say! (1913) and Duke of Crowborough in Betty (1916).  \nIn his latter years Herbert moved into the media of film, appearing in at least six silent films between 1917 and 1919 including The Divorce Game (1917), The Teeth of the Tiger (1919) and Laughing Bill Hyde (1918).\n\n## Writer and director  \n<ImageHere>The chorus in Fascinating Flora (book by R. H. Burnside and Joseph W. Herbert, music by Gustave Kerker) Casino Theatre, New York (1907)\nHerbert also carved a career as a successful dramatist and lyricist, writing firstly the book for the comedy After the Ball (1893) while his first musical was The Birth of Venus (1895) with music by Edward Jakobowski. For burlesque he wrote Thrilby (1895), a parody of the successful Trilby and with a score by Frank Osmond Carr; The Geezer (1896\u201397), a parody of The Geisha; The Social Whirl (1906); Fascinating Flora (1907) and wrote lyrics for The Top o' th' World (1907\u20131908). He authored a musical play The Prince of Borneo, which was staged in three different versions in three different continents under three different titles in search of success until it eventually emerged in 1909 as The Beauty Spot to music by Reginald De Koven. He wrote The Lamb of Delft (1911); The Duchess (1911); supplied the text for the Al Jolson vehicle The Honeymoon Express (1913); wrote lyrics for Alone at Last (1915\u20131916) and wrote Honeydew (1920\u20131921).  \nAs a writer and director Herbert adapted the farce The Turtle (1898); wrote and directed the musical comedy Tommy Rot (1902); wrote, directed and played Miche in the musical Mam'selle Napoleon (1903\u20131904); wrote and played Laird O'Findon Haddock in About Town (1906); wrote The Great Decide (1906); wrote and played Toby Blockett in The Orchid (1907\u20131908); wrote the adaptation and played Prince Lothar in A Waltz Dream (1908); wrote and directed the operetta Madame Troubadour (1910) and wrote and directed Sue, Dear (1922). Between 1903 and 1915 Herbert also worked as a stage director, directing, among others the comic opera Red Feather (1903\u20131904); King of Cadonia (1910); a 1910 revival of The Mikado and The Red Petticoat (1912\u20131913).  \nA naturalised American citizen, he  married four times: in 1888 to Nanette L. Herbert with whom he had a son, the actor and singer Joseph William Herbert Jr. (1887\u20131960); in 1895 to the actress Adele Ritchie (divorced); the actress Billie Norton (who he met when they appeared together in It Happened in Nordland in 1904) and Mary Lines Maynard.  \nJoseph William Herbert died of heart disease in New York in 1923 aged 59.\n\n\nQuestion: Which musical was written by Joseph W.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# GE Dash 9 Series  \nThe Dash 9 Series is a line of diesel locomotives built by GE Transportation. It replaced the Dash 8 Series in the mid-1990s, and was superseded by the Evolution Series in the mid-2000s. Dash 9 series locomotives are some of the most common in the United States.  \n## Specifications  \nThe Dash 9 Series is an improved version of the Dash 8 Series.  Like that earlier Series, it has a microprocessor-equipped engine control unit, and a modular system of construction of the vehicle body.  \nAll models of the Dash 9 Series are powered by a 16-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine, with electronic fuel injection and split cooling.  \nDash 9 Series locomotives also ride on HiAd high adhesion trucks, with low weight transfer characteristics and microprocessor controlled wheelslip.  \n## Six axle models  \n### Common feature  \nA specification common to all Dash 9 Series six axle models is the AAR wheel arrangement known as C-C  \n### C40-9  \nNS C40-9 # 8801.  \nThis version of the Dash 9 was manufactured between January and March 1995.  All 125 examples of this model are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway.  \nThe C40-9 is the only model in the Dash 9 Series to feature the standard cab design. All were built with rooftop-mounted air conditioners which gives them a rather unusual and distinctive look - and were quickly coined \"top hats\" by the railfan community. Other than the standard cab, the model is identical in all specifications to the wide-nose \"North American\" safety cab Dash 9-40CW (or C40-9W) model (see below).  \nNS specifically requested the standard cab, and may have purchased more units had the Federal Railroad Administration not required it to purchase the wide-nose C40-9W version instead. Besides, standard cab GE's had become more expensive by the mid-1990s, since they were now considered optional equipment by the builder, and thus priced as such, and when a carrier is purchasing one or two hundred units of a particular model at a time, even a slight extra price for a customized cab can add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of a locomotive order.  \nIn 2015, the railroad announced the locomotives would be given a new wide cab, A.C. traction motors, cab signals, LSL and uprated to 4400 HP. The new locomotives will be designated as AC44C6M. The last of the \"top hats\" were rebuilt to AC44C6M's in November 2018.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3  \n### C40-9W  \nNS C40-9W # 9258.  \nAll 1,090 units of this model were built for the Norfolk Southern Railway, as road numbers 8889 to 9978. The orders for these units were basically an extension of NS's previous order for the standard cab Dash 9-40C (or C40-9) (see above). They were built under the same premise that a lower power rating than the abbr=on rating of the Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see below) would prolong the life of the engine, and use less fuel. However, there is a manual override switch that allows the engineer to run the engine with all abbr=on if necessary.  \nAs with the C40-9, Norfolk Southern began to upgrade their C40-9W's from 4,000 to 4,400\u00a0hp and AC traction in mid-2015, making them AC44C6M's as well.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3  \n### C44-9W  \n<ImageHere>Hamersley Iron C44-9W # 7072 at the Brockman 4 mine.\nThe C44-9W model was in production between 1993 and 2004 with 53 pre-production units being built for CSX with an extended Dash 8 carbody and trucks a couple years earlier.  \nOf all the Dash 9 Series models, this one received by far the greatest number of orders.  \nA total of 1,697 orders for C44-9W's were received from Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and successor BNSF Railway (known at the time as the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway).  \nOther large orders from North American operators were placed by Canadian National Railway and a number of operators that have since been absorbed by the present day Union Pacific Railroad, including Chicago and Northwestern and Southern Pacific.  \nSubstantial orders for this model were also received from operators in Australia and Brazil, in the latter case for 1600mm broad gauge versions.  \nGeneral Electric and Norfolk Southern agreed to rebuild 450 of these C44-9W's, making them AC44C6M's along with their C40-9's and C40-9W's. Norfolk Southern is essentially converting all of their Dash 9 units into AC44C6M's.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3\n\n### C-38AChe  \n<ImageHere>China Railway NJ2 0053.\nThe C-38AChe, also known as the NJ2, is operated by China Railway.  \nBuilt in Erie, Pennsylvania, it is based on a standard Dash 9-44CW (or C44-9W) (see above) and marketed as the GE C38AChe.  \nThe model was specially customised for high altitude operation on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway route.  \nIt is used on the Qingzang Railway, which connects Xining, Qinghai Province, to Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, in the People's Republic of China.  \n* Power output: sigfig=3\n\n## Eight axle model  \n### BB40-9W  \nThis is a 1000mm (meter gauge) version of the C40-9W.  It was manufactured between 1997 and 2006.  \nAll 141 examples of the model are owned by the Estrada de Ferro Vit\u00f3ria a Minas (EFVM), a railroad in Brazil.  \nThe model is equipped with four B-style trucks, two at each end, replacing the conventional C-style trucks. The different trucks are necessary due to the railroad load limit per axle, which is lb.  \nThe standard C40-9W traction motors cannot fit in the narrower trucks. To achieve the same total power, more of the smaller traction motors are needed.  \n* Power output: lk=in\n\nQuestion: Which locomotive was specifically customized for high altitude operation on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway route?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nalt=An engraving by Theodor Josef Hubert Hoffbauer of the Saints Innocents Cemetery and its church. The image shows the Rue Saint-Denis on the left, the church at the rear and the graveyard in the foreground. A burial is taking place.\nThe novel takes place immediately before the French Revolution and, while not discussed in the novel, a number of sights and incidents foreshadow the impending events. Clare Clark, in The Guardian, stated \"as Baratte's story unfolds, the impending revolution hangs over the narrative like the blade of the guillotine to come\", identifying a number of auguries of the future turmoil; including \"an organist playing to an empty church\", the local theatre putting on a production of Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro; and a cart displaying the phrase \"M Hulot et Fils: D\u00e9m\u00e9nageurs \u00e0 la Noblesse\" on its side (English: M Hulot and Son: Movers to the Nobility). In The Week, Michael Bywater stated he felt that the novel has \"a sense in the air that something decisive is going to happen, and happen soon\".  \nThomas Quinn for The Big Issue opined that the removal of the cemetery as a whole could be construed as Miller asking \"whether we should sweep away the past in the name of progress\" or if we should be \"confronting set ideas about what makes us human in the first place\".  \nMiller also aimed to imbue the novel with a sense of anxiety, especially concerning the decisions Jean-Baptiste must take. Commenting on fiction in general in an interview with Lorna Bradbury for The Daily Telegraph, Miller stated that \"a novel is a collection of anxieties held together, more or less well, more or less interestingly, by the chicken wire of plot\". Bradbury goes on to state \"that is absolutely the case with Pure, which details multiple counts of insanity as the panic-inducing business of razing the cemetery takes hold\". Of Pure specifically, Miller stated that \"I'm interested in what anxiety does to people\", \"in what happens when they can't respond the way the world expects them to. What happens when our sense of ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances? What's left? That's a very interesting place to be.\"  \nAnother theme prevalent in the novel is death, influenced in part by the death of Miller's father, to whom the book is dedicated. Miller stated that \"after the age of fortysomething, death is a taste in your mouth, and never goes away again\". The reviewer for The Australian called the novel \"a meditation on death and the frailty of the body and spirit\".\n\n## Development  \nMiller first heard about the clearing of the Les Innocents cemetery ten years before writing the novel, when reading a book by French medievalist and historian, Philippe Ari\u00e8s; specifically, his 1977 work entitled L'Homme devant la mort, or The Hour of Our Death. Ari\u00e8s' book did not go into a great deal of detail concerning this actual event, however, Miller was \"taken by the theatricality\" of it and decided to write a novel based around the exhumation. In an interview with Kira Cochrane he stated the novel \"appealed to him as being interesting, visually interesting\", stating \"it was when it all happened that made it stand out. It's the 1780s, a few years before the French revolution\". Miller further stated that his father's occupation as a doctor also had some bearing on his interest in the human body, stating \"I grew up looking at these things \u2013 my Beano and Dandy were the BMJ and The Lancet\". Miller decided not to include any French dialogue in the novel as \"it is so pretentious\" in an English-language novel, stating \"I was afraid that my editor would strike it out\".  \n### Publication history  \n* 2011, UK, Sceptre 978-1-4447-2425-7, pub date 9 Jun 2011, Hardback  \n* 2012, UK, Sceptre 978-1-4447-2428-8, pub date 5 Jan 2012, Paperback  \n* 2012, UK, Dreamscape Media, pub date 29 May 2012, Audiobook  \n* 2012, USA, Europa Editions 978-1-60945-067-0, pub date 29 May 2012, Paperback  \n### Novel's title  \nThe novel's title can be attributed to a number of aspects of the work. The purification of the cemetery and the recent change in social mores (in relation to dirt and decay) being the most immediately apparent. James Kidd, writing for The Independent, stated \"if this suggests one definition of purity, others are suggested by political undercurrents. Namely, the ideals that helped shape the French Revolution: Voltaire's call to reason, Rousseau's call to equality, and Robespierre's call to arms.\"  \n### Cover  \n<ImageHere>alt=Francisco Goya's 1797\u20131799 etching, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. The self-portrait shows the artist seated and burying his head into his arms, as owls and bats surround and assail him.\nThe cover, created by Royston Knipe, was based on Francisco Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. It features Baratte in his pistachio green silk Charvet suit replacing the recumbent Goya in his self-portrait. Instead of the owls and bats which assail Goya in The Sleep of Reason, Knipe used ravens. The cover was noted by The Guardian writer John Dugdale, in an article about the marketing aspect of book cover design, as being unique in the current market. He stated that; along with the covers for The Sense of an Ending and The Tiger's Wife; \"None of the three looks like anything else in bookshops\".\n\n### Audio adaptations  \nA Sweet Talk production of Pure was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as part of the Book at Bedtime programme from 20\u201331 August 2012; it was read by John Sessions, abridged by Jeremy Osborne and produced by Rosalynd Ward.  \nThe novel was also the inspiration for two songs written by Bath based musicians, The Bookshop Band, namely \"The downfall of Les Innocents\" and \"The Engineer's Paris\" from their album Into The Farthest Reaches.  \n## Reception  \nThe novel received almost universal praise, with reviewers praising Miller's approach to the subject, his vividly rendered characters and setting and his eloquent prose.  \nIn a review for The Independent, James Urquhart found the novel to be \"richly textured\" and that it had \"energetic, acutely observed characters\"; stating \"Miller populates Baratte's quest for equanimity with these lush and tart characters, seductively fleshed out, who collectively help to deliver the bittersweet resolution of Baratte's professional and personal travails.\" Clare Clark, writing for The Guardian, found that \"Miller is a writer of subtlety and skill\" and stated that she found the novel to be much like a parable, stating that \"Unlike many parables, however, Pure is neither laboured nor leaden. Miller writes like a poet, with a deceptive simplicity \u2013 his sentences and images are intense distillations, conjuring the fleeting details of existence with clarity.\" Clark goes on to say that \"Pure defies the ordinary conventions of storytelling, slipping dream-like between lucidity and a kind of abstracted elusiveness. The characters are often opaque. The narrative lacks dramatic structure, unfolding in the present tense much as life does, without clear shape or climax\" and found that \"The result is a book that is unsettling and, ultimately, optimistic.\" The Australian's Jennifer Levasseur found Pure to be \"Well-executed and inventive\", stating that she found the plot \"Historically convincing, immediately engaging and intellectually stimulating\". She went on to state, of Miller himself: \"Miller is the calibre of writer who deserves to be followed regardless of topic, time period or setting because of his astonishing dexterity with language, his piercing observations and his ability to combine rollicking storytelling with depth of character.\"  \nNovelist Brian Lynch, writing for the Irish Independent found \"The story in Pure is simple, almost dreamlike, a realistic fantasy, a violent fairy tale for adults\", stating \"At its best Pure shimmers\". The novel received two reviews from The Daily Telegraph. Freya Johnston found that \"Miller lingers up close on details: sour breath, decaying objects, pretty clothes, flames, smells, eyelashes. He is a close observer of cats\" and stated, of Baratte's project as a whole, \"Miller intimately imagines how it might have felt to witness it.\" Holly Kyte found Pure to be \"irresistibly compelling\" and \"Exquisite inside and out\". She stated that \"Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind\" and that she found that \"Pure is a near-faultless thing: detailed, symbolic and richly evocative of a time, place and man in dangerous flux. It is brilliance distilled, with very few impurities.\" Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated \"Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work\" and also noted that \"Miller's portraits of women and the poor are thoughtful and subtle.\" Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be \"very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times\" and stated that \"Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour. It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy.\"  \nIn a review for The Observer, Leo Robson found the novel to be somewhat underwhelming, stating that \"It is disappointing, given the vitality of the novel's setting and set-up, that Miller fails to achieve corresponding dynamism in the development of plot and character\", adding that \"as a prose writer, Miller appears averse to taking risks, which means no pratfalls \u2013 but no glory either\". He found the \"engineer's progress and his setbacks are narrated in a patient, tight-lipped present tense, and just as the novel rarely concerns itself with anything that doesn't impinge on the destruction of Les Innocents, so it rarely deviates from its obsessive regime of description and dialogue\". He did somewhat temper this, however, stating that \"It is one of the historical novel's advantages over the topical or journalistic novel that the benchmark is plausibility rather than verifiable authenticity. Success in this effort requires a capacity for immersion and a degree of imagination, and whatever his shortcomings as a prose writer and a storyteller, Andrew Miller is endowed with both.\"  \n## Awards and nominations  \nThe novel was not longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, to the surprise of a number of reviewers. The novel did, however, win the Costa Book Award in 2011 for the \"Best Novel\" and \"Book of the Year\".  \nNovelist Rose Tremain, writing for The Guardian, identified the novel as one of her two \"Books of the year 2011\". In 2012, The Observer named it as one of \"The 10 best historical novels\". It was shortlisted for the 2012 Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction, with judges praising the novel as \"a wholly unexpected story, richly imagined and beautifully structured\"; and the South Bank Award in the \"Literature\" category. The novel was also short-listed for the \"Independent Booksellers' Week\" Book Awards, which are voted for by the public through independent book-shops. The marketing campaign for the novel was short-listed in the \"Best Overall Package\" award by the Book Marketing Society in their Best Marketing Campaign of the Year awards.  \nPure was identified as an \"Editors' Choice\" by The New York Times in June 2012. The novel was also listed on the Belfast Telegraph \"Your Top Choice\" listing for the best book of the week. Pure has, lc=y, been listed twelve times; with the first seven being in position 1. NPR listed it as one of their \"Critics' Lists\" for summer 2012 in the \"Rich Reads: Historical Fiction Fit for a Queen\" section, nominated by historical fiction author Madeline Miller who stated that \"this is historical fiction at its best.\"  \n### Costa \"Book of the Year\"  \nSpeaking about the novel at the awards ceremony in Piccadilly, London, Miller stated that he \"had no special sense of this one being the one\" and mentioned that \"it's a strange journey, you spend three years in a room on your own and then this: a little unsettling but deeply pleasurable\"; \"It's a very happy occasion\". Chair of the judging, editor of the Evening Standard newspaper Geordie Greig, said that the panel were basing their decision partially on the durability and memorability of the work, stating \"we were looking for quality\".  \nThe judges were undecided over whether the prize should have gone to Matthew Hollis' biography Now All Roads Lead to France instead. The judging panel was locked in a \"fierce debate and quite bitter dissent\" and eventually used a vote to decide on the winner. Geordie Greig said \"it was not unpleasant, it was forthright\", stating \"it's not like comparing apples and oranges \u2013 it's like comparing bananas and curry.\" Chair for the selection in 2010, web editor for Foyles bookshops Jonathan Ruppin, supported the decision, stating \"Like Hilary Mantel, who finally became a major name when she won the Man Booker, Miller should now gain the commercial success his stylish and absorbing novels have long deserved.\" He goes on to say \"Pure perfectly captures the mood of a downtrodden and angry nation, on the verge of overthrowing a self-serving and out-of-touch ruling class \u2013 it's very much a book for our time.\"  \nThe 2011 awards were subject to some attention from bookmakers, who offered odds of 2/1 for favourite Matthew Hollis' biography Now All Roads Lead To France and odds of 3/1 for Miller's Pure.\n\nQuestion: Which theme is common to the novel discussed in the description of the first image and the artwork depicted in the second image?\nChoice list: \nA.

He previously competed in the FIA Formula 3 Championship in 2020, 2021 and 2022.  \n## Racing career  \n### Lower formulae  \n2017 was Smolyar's debut season in single-seater racing. He competed for SMP Racing in the Spanish and Russian Formula 4 Championships, finishing 3rd in both. He scored a total of 24 podiums, with all of his race wins coming in the Spanish Championship.  \n### Formula Renault Eurocup  \n#### 2018  \nIn the following two years the Russian driver raced in the Formula Renault Eurocup. In his debut campaign, driving for Tech 1 Racing, Smolyar finished 12th in the standings, beating out two of his three teammates and helping the team to finish 5th in the team championship.  \n#### 2019  \nHis 2019 season would prove to be much more successful. He finished 3rd and won three races, only being beaten in the championship by Frenchman Victor Martins and his R-ace GP teammate, Oscar Piastri.  \n### FIA Formula 3 Championship  \n#### 2020  \nSmolyar was signed by ART Grand Prix to drive for them in the 2020 Formula 3 Championship alongside ADAC F4 champion Th\u00e9o Pourchaire and Sebasti\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez. Despite a slew of strong performances, which included a pole position at the Hungaroring and a win on the road at the first round in Britain the Russian's season was plagued with bad luck. This included having his win taken away by a penalty for weaving on the Hangar straight as well as a collision at the first corner in Budapest. Smolyar scored his only podium of the season in the second race at Monza and ended up eleventh in the standings, behind eventual runner-up Pourchaire, but ahead of his more experienced teammate Fern\u00e1ndez.  \n#### 2021  \n<ImageHere>Smolyar driving the Dallara F3 2019 during the 2021 Spielberg Formula 3 round.\nFor the 2021 season Smolyar re-signed with ART, this time partnering Frederik Vesti and racing returnee Juan Manuel Correa. Smolyar's start to the season was strong, with him taking his first Formula 3 victory in the first race of the opening weekend. He then continued his good form and came out victorious in race one at the Circuit Paul Ricard, after having battled from sixth on the grid to first on the final lap. Smolyar finished the season with a total of 106 points, placing 6th in the championship. During that season, he scored a total of 2 wins, 2 fastest laps, and 4 podiums.\n\n#### 2022  \n<ImageHere>Smolyar driving for MP Motorsport during the 2022 Spielberg Formula 3 round.\nOn 20 January 2022, Smolyar announced that he would switch to MP Motorsport for the 2022 season. However, he was banned of using the Russian flag due to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. He was initially not due to race in the championship due to the mentioned war, but eventually was allowed to race. Smolyar was forced to miss the Silverstone round of the championship since he could not get to the United Kingdom due to visa issues, and was replaced by Filip Ugran. He returned to his seat for the remaining events and picked up his sole win of the season in the feature race in Budapest. Smolyar ended up tenth in the standings, being the highest placed driver to have missed a round.\n\n## Karting record  \n### Karting career summary  \n### Complete Karting World Championship results  \n## Racing record  \n### Racing career summary  \n### Complete SMP F4 Championship results  \n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)  \n### Complete F4 Spanish Championship results  \n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)  \n### Complete Formula Renault Eurocup results  \n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)  \n### Complete FIA Formula 3 Championship results  \n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate points for the fastest lap of top ten finishers)\n\nQuestion: In which season did Smolyar achieve a higher championship position in the Formula 3 series?\nChoice list: \nA. 2021\nB. 2022\nC. 2020\nD. 2019\nYour answer is: ",

        "question": "Analyze the given context and associated images, draw inferences from the combination of both, and provide responses to posed questions.\nContext:\n# Chinese mythological geography  \n<ImageHere>Magpie Bridge (Queqiao), crossing the Silver River (Milky Way), one of the famous mythological locations of Chinese mythology. Depicted as a mural decorating the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, in Beijing.\nChinese mythological geography refers to the related mythological concepts of geography and cosmology, in the context of the geographic area now known as \"China\", which was typically conceived of as the center of the universe. The \"Middle Kingdom\" thus served as a reference point for a geography sometimes real and sometimes mythological, including lands and seas surrounding the Middle Land, with mountain peaks and sky (Heaven or heavens) above, with sacred grottoes and an underworld below, and even sometimes with some very abstract other worlds.\n\n## Mythological geography of China  \n\"Chinese mythology\" refers to mythology associated with the geographic area now known as \"China\", and in traditional Chinese mythology often known as the \"Middle Kingdom\". Chinese mythology includes many varied myths from regional and cultural traditions. Chinese mythology is far from monolithic, not being an integrated system, even among just Han people. Chinese mythology is encountered in the traditions of various classes of people, geographic regions, historical periods including the present, and from various ethnic groups. China is the home of many mythological traditions, including that of Han Chinese and their Huaxia predecessors, as well as Tibetan mythology, Turkic mythology, Korean mythology, and many others. However, the study of Chinese mythology tends to focus upon material in  Chinese language. Much of the mythology involves exciting stories full of fantastic people and beings, the use of magical powers, often taking place in an exotic mythological place or time. Along with Chinese folklore, Chinese mythology forms an  important part of Chinese folk religion (Yang 2005, 4, and elsewhere). In these cases, Chinese mythological geography forms and informs these ideational processes.  \n## Cosmology  \n\"Cosmology\" refers to the entirety of the Earth and its environment, significantly including Heaven (or Sky), Earth, a mythological underworld, and other less Earth-oriented conceptual locations.  \n### Earth  \nIn ancient China, the Earth was held to be flat.  \n### Heaven  \n\"Heaven\" (or \"sky\") refers to the universe outward of the Earth's surface and the concept of it as a liminal place that guides fate.  \n### Underworld  \n<ImageHere>Ox-Head and Horse-Face in the Hell Scroll at Seattle Asian Art Museum\n\"Underworld\" (or \"Hell\") refers to the universe located underneath the Earth's surface. Apparently this motif appears relatively late in the course of the development of Chinese mythology. The introduction of Buddhism certainly seems to have included a greater focus upon the fate of the soul and detailed depictions of a possible afterlife underground.\n\n### Otherworldly locations  \n\"Non-Earth-based locations\", include, for example the Pure Lands of Buddhism.  \n## Geography  \n### Middle earth  \nThe perspective of Chinese mythological geography tends to focus on the locus of those possessing the myths, as a \"center\" or \"middle\" area, based on land, with Sky above, Underworld below, and replete with mountains, seas, islands, and grottoes. Mythological locations tend to be replete with local inhabitants, of a mythological variety. Although Chinese mythological geography tends to focus on humans existing on a middle land territory of earth, a major motif is change, such as in the flood mythology of China.  \n#### Mountains  \nVarious mountains present an appearance in Chinese mythology. The Kunlun Mountain(s) of mythology are associated with a number of deities, such as Xiwangmu, Yu Shi, various shamans, and xian immortals.  \n##### Example  \nAs the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an axis mundi from the cosmology of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) Mount Sumeru (Christie 1968, 74).  \n#### Grottoes  \nThe counter feature to the holy or sacred mountains and peaks were the grotto-heavens, and various grottoes appear in Chinese mythological landscape. Sometimes sacred grottoes are associated with sacred mountains; and both may correspond to actual geolocations, but with an overlay of mythological geography.  \n#### Seas  \nVarious seas or oceans present an appearance in Chinese mythology. Sometimes \"the Sea\" appears in a generic way, or in a directionally designated way such, as in the Jingwei story involving the Eastern Sea. Often a Dragon King was located in a sea, appropriately palaced. Sometimes sea and dry land were thought to alternate, as in the case of the Mulberry Fields and the sea related in the story of Magu.  \n#### Rivers  \nVarious rivers appear in Chinese mythology.  \n##### Example  \nVarious mythological geography is associated with the Red River, including one or more of the eight mountain pillars, especially the rivers thought to flow from or surround (mythological) Kunlun Mountain, the Weak River, the Black River, and intervening terrain, such as the Moving Sands. Jade Mountain was also in the vicinity (Yang 2005: 160-162).  \n#### Islands  \nVarious islands present an appearance in Chinese mythology.  \n### Inhabitants and other features  \nThe inhabitants and features of Chinese mythological geography add life and interest to the whole subject, and contribute toward more complete mythological narratives. Examples include mythological plants, animals, humans, other beings, magical jewels, weapons and other objects.  \n### Philosophers  \nThere were a number of schools of thought about Chinese cosmology. Very few pieces of information are known about the Suan Ye school, except that its followers believed the stars and the sun moved on their own in space. Another philosophical school held that the universe was a cosmic egg, the sky was a painting on the top half of the shell, and that the flat Earth floated on top of water that dominated the bottom half. An older tradition, Zhou Bei, taught that the sky was a concave bowl that rotated.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a concept that was influenced by the introduction of Buddhism into Chinese mythology?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nMartinez (right) with Terry McDermott (left) during The Voice\nMartinez then auditioned for the third season of The Voice. She had not watched the show herself prior to the audition. The initial, untelevised audition was an open call, held at Javits Center. She recalls that while she and her mother were driving to the audition, her mother's car broke down before they reached the Queens\u2013Midtown Tunnel, and the two were forced to \"hitchhike\" a taxicab in order to get there. Several months after the initial audition, while at Roosevelt Field Mall, Martinez received word that she had advanced to the \"second round\". She then received multiple callbacks until she was finally selected to audition on the show itself. Martinez auditioned singing Britney Spears's \"Toxic\" with three of the four judges (Adam Levine, CeeLo Green and Blake Shelton) hitting their \"I Want You\" button. Martinez ultimately chose Adam Levine to be her coach.  \nIn the Battle Round, Martinez competed against Caitlin Michele. They performed a duet of the Ellie Goulding song \"Lights\". Martinez won and moved on to the Knockout Round. Michele was stolen by Cee Lo Green and also moved on. In the Knockout Round, Martinez was paired with Sam James. She chose to sing La Roux's \"Bulletproof\". Levine eliminated James, and Martinez moved on to the Live Rounds as one of the five remaining members of Team Adam. In week one of the Live Rounds, Martinez sang \"Hit the Road Jack\". Public vote saved Team Adam members Amanda Brown and Bryan Keith. Levine then chose Martinez over Loren Allred and Joselyn Rivera to remain in the competition. In week three, Martinez's performance of \"Seven Nation Army\" finished the voting period at #10 on the iTunes Top 200 Single Chart, causing her iTunes votes to be multiplied by ten. This occurred again in week four, when \"Too Close\" ended the voting period at #6.  \nMartinez was eliminated by audience vote in week five, along with the fellow Team Adam member Amanda Brown, leaving Levine with no artists. In response, Martinez said, \"I never expected to get this far and this is beyond what I've ever dreamed of. I'm just so glad I got to express who I am as an artist and really touch people's hearts because that was the ultimate goal\".  \nborder=darkgray \u2013 Studio version of performance reached the top 10 on iTunes  \nAfter the show, Martinez began working independently on original material, which she says she spent the majority of 2013 writing. She released her debut single, \"Dollhouse\", on February 9, 2014. She later compared the song's story to Edward Scissorhands, saying \"It's the perfect home with the perfect lawn and they all look the same. But behind each house there's a screwed up group of people who are hiding behind wealth and perfection.\" Martinez also released a music video for the track, which was fan-funded by an Indiegogo page created by Martinez, and hair, makeup, and shooting were all done by friends of hers. The song was produced and cowritten by NYC songwriting duo Kinetics & One Love.  \nOn April 7, 2014, Martinez signed to Atlantic Records and released her debut EP, Dollhouse, a month later on May 19, 2014. The only single from the EP, \"Carousel\", reached number nine on the Alternative Digital Songs chart, was certified gold by the RIAA, and featured in a preview for FX's miniseries American Horror Story: Freak Show. She promoted the EP with the Dollhouse Tour which lasted from June 2014 to March 2015.\n\n### 2015\u20132022: Cry Baby, K\u201312 and After School EP  \n<ImageHere>Martinez (pictured) performing in 2015 on the Cry Baby Tour.\nOn June 1, 2015, Martinez released the single \"Pity Party\", which sampled Lesley Gore's \"It's My Party\". This was followed by the album's second single, \"Soap\". The song reached number twelve on the Alternative Digital Songs chart, and number sixteen on the Pop Digital Songs chart. The third single, \"Sippy Cup\", followed on July 31. Cry Baby, her debut album, was released on August 14, 2015, to moderate critical acclaim and debuted at number 6 on the Billboard 200. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on February 24, 2017. Martinez went on the Cry Baby Tour to promote the album, which lasted from 2015 to 2017.  \nIn May 2016, Martinez released her second EP, Pity Party, in Ireland, Mexico and the UK exclusively. A month later, Martinez said she had started working on and recording her second album. In November 2016, Martinez released her third EP, Cry Baby's Extra Clutter, a physical vinyl release of the bonus tracks from Cry Baby as well as \"Gingerbread Man\", a Christmas-themed single which was initially released in December 2015 on SoundCloud but later released as a solo single in January 2016.  \nIn October 2016, Martinez released a commercial for her fragrance, Cry Baby Perfume Milk, noting that the \"idea for this perfume has been cultivating in my brain since the moment I finished writing\" Cry Baby. The perfume was directly distributed by Martinez's record label, Atlantic, making them the first record label to distribute a fragrance. Martinez also collaborated with cosmetics company Lime Crime, Inc. to release two \"exclusive\" lipsticks: a blue lipstick called \"Cry Baby\" on August 17, 2015, and a brown lipstick called \"Teddy Bear\" on March 9, 2016.  \nOn May 15, 2019, Martinez released a teaser trailer for her second album, K\u201312 which was eventually released on September 6, 2019, and debuted at number 3 on Billboard 200. The album was accompanied by a musical\u00a0fantasy horror film, which was written and directed by Martinez. In an interview with People, Martinez alluded to future sequels and visual albums being released. The album was promoted with the K\u201312 Tour began on October 13, 2019, in Washington, D.C. and concluded prematurely on February 17, 2020, in Brixton, England due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nIn January 2020, Martinez announced she was working on an EP titled After School, which was then set to be released in the spring of 2020 and serve as the deluxe edition of K\u201312. On February 10, 2020, Martinez released a stand-alone single, \"Copy Cat\" which featured Tierra Whack, marking Martinez's first feature. Martinez later released a second single from the EP, \"Fire Drill\", on June 26, 2020, which had previously featured in the credits of the K\u201312 film. Both songs were not included on After School, which was eventually delayed and released on September 25, 2020.  \nIn April 2020, \"Play Date\" became one of the top 100 most-played songs on Spotify in the US after gaining popularity on TikTok. In 2021, Martinez featured on Forbes Under 30 list.\n\n### 2023\u2013present: Portals  \nOn February 18, 2023, after archiving all her Instagram posts, Martinez teased her third studio album, Portals. The album was released on March 31, 2023, and was promoted with the singles, \"Death\" and \"Void\" which charted at number 95 and 61 respectively, marking her first original appearances on the Billboard Hot 100.efn|While participating on The Voice in 2012, Martinez's covers of \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"Too Close\" had charted on the Hot 100. She embarked on the Portals Tour in May 2023.Martinez was nominated for the VMA's Best Visual Effects, for the music for her single \"Void\". She was eventually defeated by Taylor Swift in the final round, losing to Anti-Hero.  \n## Artistry  \n### Musical style  \nMartinez's music has been described as pop, alternative pop, art pop, electropop, and dark pop. Cry Baby and K\u201312 were seen to have hip hop and R&B undertones. Portals saw Melanie venturing into experimental sounds and pop-rock.  \nMartinez's music has been described by The Guardian as \"off-kilter, sweary electropop\". Rolling Stone described Martinez's music as \"twisted lullabies about love, danger and madness\", and compared her music to that of \"'Coin-Operated Boy'-era Dresden Dolls\" and Lana Del Rey. The New York Timess  \nJon Pareles described her music as \"perching prettily tinkling keyboards and concise pop choruses amid the slow, ominous basslines and twitchy percussion of Southern hip-hop \u2013 a candy-coated variation on the dirges of Lorde and Lana Del Rey\", and described her mezzo-soprano voice as \"whispery, sardonic, tearful, and furious\". Billboards Jason Lipshutz also compared Martinez to Del Rey and Lorde, saying, \"Martinez is clearly cribbing from the dimly lit pop stylings of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, but while her wispy delivery strikes the same femme fatale poses, she lacks the subtlety of her influences\", and that \"Martinez is admirably ambitious, but her insistence on sticking to Cry Babys central idea leaves her contorting into uncomfortable positions\".  \nMartinez describes her alter ego and the protagonist of her debut album, Cry Baby, as a \"fairy tale\" version of herself.  Martinez's songs are often based on personal experiences. Martinez described her own music as \"very dark and honest\" and \"hip hop/trap inspired beats with creepy nostalgic childlike sounds such as baby pianos, music boxes, and toys\".  \n### Influences  \nMartinez listened to Christina Aguilera, Brandy, Britney Spears,  The Beatles, Tupac Shakur, Shakira, and Biggie Smalls growing up, and wanted to be a singer from a young age.  \nMartinez has cited The Beatles, Neutral Milk Hotel, Feist, Kimbra, Zooey Deschanel, Regina Spektor, and CocoRosie as influences of hers. Specific albums which have influenced her music include The Idler Wheel... by Fiona Apple and Ariana Grande's albums Yours Truly and My Everything. She attributes the \"heavy hip-hop influence\" in her music to her father playing hip-hop music in the family's house often during her childhood.  \nThe visuals in Martinez's music videos have been influenced by her favorite visual artists: Mark Ryden, Aleksandra Waliszewska and Nicoletta Ceccoli. She named Tim Burton as a large influence of hers, and has said that to make a movie with him would be her \"one dream\".  \n## Public image  \nAt age sixteen, after watching 101 Dalmatians, Martinez dyed half of her hair blonde, in the same vein as Cruella de Vil. She became known for the look, as well as her \"baby doll\"-inspired outfits in music videos and when performing.  The Guardian has called her image \"doll-like and decidedly emo ... hyperreal\" while her music is best known to be \"part-nursery rhyme, part tragic life story\".  \n### Sexual assault allegation  \nOn December 4, 2017, Timothy Heller, a woman with whom Martinez once shared a friendship, alleged via Twitter that Martinez had sexually assaulted and raped her. The following day, Martinez tweeted a response to Heller's accusations, saying the allegations \"horrified and saddened\" her, and that Heller \"never said no to what they chose to do together\". On December 9, 2017, Martinez released a second statement, thanking her fans for citing Heller's \"false statements\". She concluded the statement with: \"...I would never be intimate with someone without their absolute consent.\" Martinez released the song \"Piggyback\" on SoundCloud, an act believed to be in response to Heller's accusations.  \nIn a review of Martinez's third album, Portals, Sam Franzini of The Line of Best Fit wrote that the album track \"Battle of the Larynx\" is \"a five-minute saga detailing serious accusations leveled against her\".  \n## Discography  \nStudio albums  \n* Cry Baby (2015)  \n* K\u201312 (2019)  \n* Portals (2023)  \n## Filmography  \n### Film  \n### Television  \n### Web  \n## Tours  \nHeadlining  \n* Dollhouse Tour (2014\u20132015)  \n* Cry Baby Tour (2015\u20132017)  \n* K\u201312 Tour (2019\u20132020)  \n* Portals Tour (2023-2024)  \nSupporting  \n* Lindsey Stirling \u2013 Music Box Tour (2015)  \n* Adam Lambert \u2013 The Original High Tour (2016)  \n## Awards and nominations\n\nQuestion: Which song performed by the artist in the images was featured in a preview for FX's miniseries American Horror Story: Freak Show?\nChoice list: \nA. \"Pity Party\"\nB. \"Soap\"\nC. \"Carousel\"\nD. \"Sippy Cup\"\nYour answer is: ",

Soldiers on pick-up trucks stormed the Soundiata military base in the town of Kati, where gunfire was exchanged before weapons were distributed from the armory and senior officers arrested. Tanks and armoured vehicles were seen on the town's streets, as well as military trucks heading for the capital, Bamako. The soldiers detained several government officials including President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta, who resigned and dissolved the government. This was the country's second coup in less than 10 years, following the 2012 coup d'\u00e9tat.  \n## Background  \nProtests in Mali had been ongoing since 5 June, with protesters calling for the resignation of President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta. Protesters were displeased with the government's management of the ongoing insurgency, alleged government corruption, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and a floundering economy. Eleven deaths and 124 injuries were reported during the protests.  \n## Coup d'\u00e9tat  \nOn the morning of 18 August 2020, soldiers began firing bullets into the air at a military base in Kati, a town abbr=off from Bamako, the capital of Mali. After moving into the capital, the mutineers arrested Minister of Finance Abdoulaye Daffe, the Chief of Staff of the National Guard fr, and Moussa Timbin\u00e9, speaker of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister, Boubou Ciss\u00e9, appealed for dialogue with the mutineers, acknowledging they held \"legitimate frustrations\". A mutiny leader later claimed that Ke\u00efta and Ciss\u00e9 had been arrested at the former's residence in Bamako; African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki confirmed that Ke\u00efta, Ciss\u00e9, and other officials had been arrested and called for their release. A spokesman for the M5-RFP opposition coalition welcomed their detention, describing it as a \"popular insurrection\".  \nThe officials were taken to the military camp in Kati where the uprising began. As news of the mutiny spread, hundreds of protesters gathered at Bamako's Independence Monument to demand Ke\u00efta's resignation. Protesters also set a building belonging to the Ministry of Justice ablaze.  \nAt the time, it was not clear how many soldiers took part in the coup, who initiated it or who would now take charge.  \n## Aftermath  \n<ImageHere>Assimi Go\u00efta, surrounded by members of the National Committee for the Salvation of the People, 19 August 2020\nPresident Ke\u00efta resigned around midnight, while also dissolving the government and parliament. \"I want no blood to be spilled to keep me in power,\" he added. Five colonels appeared in the TV broadcast to the nation, led by Colonel Assimi Go\u00efta. They called themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People. The bodies of four people killed by gunfire and about 15 wounded, all likely hit by stray bullets, were brought into one of the city's main hospitals, said Elhadj Djim\u00e9 Kant\u00e9, a spokesman for the hospital union. The coup leaders denied that anyone had been killed, but soldiers were constantly firing in the air, cheered on by crowds of young people.  \nMilitary leaders had ordered closure of all border crossings and imposed a night-time curfew. \"As of today, 19 August 2020, all air and land borders are closed until further notice. A curfew is in place from 21:00 to 05:00 until further notice,\" Col-Major Isma\u00ebl Wagu\u00e9, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Malian Air Force, said in a televised address. He also invited opposition groups to talks for fresh elections.  \nOpposition member Mahmoud Dicko announced that he is leaving politics as a result of a meeting between him and some of the soldiers that took part in the mutiny.  \nCoup leaders promised new elections within a \"reasonable timeline,\" without specifying what that meant.  \nKe\u00efta left the country in September for medical treatment in the United Arab Emirates. Ke\u00efta, 75 years old, was originally hospitalised in the capital a few days before leaving.\n<ImageHere>Isma\u00ebl Wagu\u00e9 (left) and Malick Diaw, 7 September 2020\nExperts chosen by Mali's new military leaders have proposed a two-year interim government led by a president chosen by them, despite calls by Mali's neighbors for elections within a year. They suggest that the soldiers behind the coup nominate the interim president and vice president and propose the interim president choose the prime minister. Under the draft, the president would be from the civil or military sectors. The nominee must be between the ages of 35 and 75 and would not be allowed to run for election at the end of the transition. Right after the coup, military leaders promised to reinstate a civilian government and hold elections within a relatively short timeframe.  \nOn 12 September 2020, the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP) agreed to an 18-month political transition to civilian rule.  \nOn 21 September 2020 Bah Ndaw was named interim president by a group of 17 electors, with Go\u00efta being appointed vice president. The government is supposed to preside over an interim period of 18 months. A spokesperson for political-religious leader Mahmoud Dicko praised his nomination as president. Leaders of the M5-RFP, active since the 2020 Malian protests, also signalled support. On 25 September the government was inaugurated.  \nOn 18 January 2021, the transitional government announced that the CNSP had been disbanded. Although the initial agreement in September 2020 had stated that the CNSP junta would be dissolved as soon as the transitional government came to power, this had not yet taken place.\n\n## International reaction  \nRepresentatives of several countries condemned the coup, as did representatives of the African Union, European Union, and United Nations. Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, a country which has been involved in fighting an Islamist insurgency in its former colony since 2013, called for power to be returned to civilians and for arrested leaders to be freed. The United States cut off military aid to Mali on 21 August 2020.  \nThe United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution condemning the coup and calling on the soldiers to return to their barracks and release all detainees without delay. Amnesty International also called for the release of the detainees. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposed sanctions on Mali and called on neighbouring states to close their land and air borders.  \nOn 25 August 2020, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie suspended Mali from membership and called for the immediate release of Ke\u00efta.  \nOn 7 September 2020 at a summit in Niamey, Niger, regional bloc ECOWAS gave the Malian military rulers a deadline of 15 September to appoint a new civilian President and Prime Minister.\n\nQuestion: Which individual was appointed as the vice president following the political transition in Mali after the events depicted in these images?\nChoice list: \nA.

The painting depicts a view of a summer cafe in Gurzuf, Crimea, in the middle of the 1950s.  \n## History  \n<ImageHere>Alexander Samokhvalov\nSamokhvalov is known in Soviet art for his portraits of typical young Soviet people of the 1930s (\"Girl in a T-shirt\", 1932, \"Metrostroevka with a drill\", 1937) as well as a monumental compositions (\"Militarized Komsomol\", 1933; \"Sergei Kirov takes parade athletes\", 1935; the monumental panel \"Soviet Sport\", 1936). They embodied the typical image of contemporary youth. The picture Cafe Gurzuf continues this theme.  \nSamokhvalov painted the present work in the mid-1950s at the zenith of his career. Not long beforehand, he had married his young wife Maria Alekseevna Kleschar (1915\u20132000), who became his muse and faithful assistant. Captivated by her beauty and youthfulness, Samokhvalov found her to be a source of true inspiration. The present work conveys the artist\u2019s fascination with beauty and youth, as depicted by the central seated figure, for which Samokhvalov\u2019s wife served as a model for the central female figure (a young woman at a table in a pink blouse, studying a menu). The graceful inclination of her head and the curve of her shoulders evince her delicate beauty.\n<ImageHere>Portrait of Maria Kleschar-Samokhvalov. 1953\nIn addition to artistic value, the picture has memorial and documentary value. This picture was painted by the artist in one of his visits to Gurzuf, where from 1950 to 1960 he repeatedly rested with his wife on the creative base of Russian artists at the former summer residence of Konstantin Korovin. A model for another female figure of the first plan from the left in a yellow dress with a red bag over his arm going up the steps became Lydia Timoshenko (1903\u20131976), artist and a wife of Yevgeny Kibrik (1906\u20131978), People's artist of the USSR.  \nPortrayed on the left in a blue suit and straw hat is Samokhvalov\u2019s friend, the artist Evgeny Kibrik, who in 1920s was a student of Pavel Filonov, as well as Samkhvalov himself, also in a straw hat and just visible over Kibrik\u2019s shoulder.  \nSamokhvalov since the 1920s was familiar with Lydia Tymoshenko and Yevgeny Kibrik and maintained friendship with them. In the 1920s, together with Tymoshenko, he was a member of the Leningrad association \"Circle of Artists\" (Krug Khudozhnikov) (1926\u20131932). The first husband of Lydia Timoshenko was artist David Zagoskin (1900\u20131942), who from 1926 to 1930 was also a member of the \"Circle of Artists\".  \nThe optimism and joy of the scene stem from the overall mood during the Thaw of the post-Stalinist period and is conveyed by Samokhvalov in the picture.\n\n## Exhibitions and publications  \nLydia Timoshenko. 1920s  \nCafe Gurzuf was first exhibited in 1960 at the grand Annual Exhibition of works by the leningrad artists of 1960 in the Exhibition Halls of the Leningrad Union of Artists.  \nIn 1963 Cafe Gurzuf was shown at the first solo exhibition of Samokhvalov in Leningrad in the Exhibition Halls of the Leningrad Union of Artists dedicated to the seventieth anniversary of the artist.  \nAfter Samokhvalov's death the painting was kept by his widow until the early 1990s when it was sold to a private collector.  \nIn 1994, after a long break time Cafe Gurzuf was shown again in the Leningrad Union of Artists at the exhibition of The Paintings of 1950-1980s by the Leningrad School artists.  \nIn 2012 the painting was exhibited in \"Manezh\" Central Exhibition Hall on The Art Fair devoted to 80th Anniversary of Saint-Petersburg Union of Artists. It was reproduced in the exhibition catalog.  \nIn 2007 Cafe Gurzuf was published in the book Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School by Sergei V. Ivanov, in Russian and English.  \nThe history of this painting was described in the article by S. Ivanov, dedicated to the wife of the artist and published in 2015 to her centenary anniversary.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true based on the information provided about the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Performance archaeology  \nPerformance archaeology is a subset of archaeological theory. Developers of this theory include Michael Shanks, Mike Pearson and Julian Thomas who in the 1990s at University of Wales, Lampeter began formulating concepts which view the social aspect of performance along with the artistic nature of theatre together through an interdisciplinary lens as \"an integrated approach to recording, writing and illustrating the material past\" thereby marrying the academic with the artistic. Performance archaeology has further expanded in the last decade upon the theories of presence. Geoff Bailey states that \"because we believe that the present is known or knowable better than the past, we must seek our inspiration in studies of present phenomena and our concepts and theories from authorities on the present.\" Michael Shanks along with Ian Hodder, Christopher Witmore, Gabriella Giannachi and Nick Kaye have recently expanded the theory further by calling for cooperation within the humanities and studying transdisciplinary research from archaeologists who are encouraged to become storytellers in order to more diversely analyze the engagement of the actor, the audience, the things and the space in which they perform by using an 'ecology of practices'. The theory of performance archaeology aims to give researchers a multi temporal link to the antiquated through studying the processual nature of \"performance of presence\" which is entangled within the 'multipleness' of time. Echoing theories posited by Martin Heidegger, the processual and temporal natures of performance are phenomenologically entwined with the experiences of the performers and audience. Stories are preserved by memory through performance. These performances can be seen both in the archaeological record as well in modern enactments or rituals. The landscape itself is an integral portion of performance memory. Performance archaeology sets itself apart from performance history by directing focus not toward the past itself but instead toward what has become of the past by taking an ethnoarchaeological approach of analyzing the 'archaeology of present' cultures which allows for a richer interpretation of past performance. Performance archaeology takes a cross-disciplinary approach with 'social archaeology' to studying the things, narratives or artifacts, that remain of ancient theatre, music, dance, art history and oral tradition in order to 'model the past'. The following examples illustrate components that might aptly demonstrate aspects of performance archaeology.  \n## Oral Cultures  \nOral cultures lacking text experience performance through epic poetry, storytelling and ritual passed down and circulated by elders, shamans and storytellers. Performance archaeology joins these experiences with material objects and geographic as well as architectural locales in order to analyze the archaic. Oral tradition utilizes bards and griots as singers of stories which are set to music in order to better retain the memory of their tales through song.  \n<ImageHere>197x197px\n\n\n### Ancient Percussion Instruments (Idiophones)  \nAncient idiophones were instruments intended to \"support man's natural feeling for dance and rhythm\" and included clappers, scrapers, rattles, sistra, cymbals and bells and have been found in both ancient Mesopotamia as well as ancient Egypt. The sistra has been linked to ancient performances associated with the goddesses Bastet, Sekhmet, and Hathor and were used in ceremonies for warding off evil spirits.  \n### Ancient Drums (Membranophones)  \nDrums are prevalent among the Sumerians, Babylonian and Hittites, but rarely found among the Egyptians. Drumming with sticks was a technique not introduced into Mesopotamia or Egypt until the later Roman invasion in the 1st century CE.  \n### Ancient Wind Instruments (Aerophones)  \nFlutes, oboes, horns, trumpets and pan pipes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt while clarinets are indigenous to Egypt alone where they may have also been called by the Arabic zummara. The organ originated in 3rd century BCE Alexandrian Egypt by fusing a pan pipe with a keyboard. 250x250px  \n### Ancient Stringed Instruments (Chordophones)  \nLyres of Ur have been found throughout what is modern-day Iraq at the Royal Cemetery at Ur \"perhaps intended to provide melodic accompaniment for the dead\" that date back to the 3rd millennium BCE. Sumerian lyres tend to be in the shape of an animal's head with the supporting sides mimicking animal horns.  \nIn Ancient Greece a lyre made of a tortoise shell was referred to as a chelys can be found on hydriai pots dating back as far as the 8th century BCE. These instruments played a daily role in child-related activities as well as during multiple performances such as symposia, weddings and komoi and were related to the god Hermes as referenced by Homer.  \nLyres were not indigenous to Egypt and did not become popular until centuries after being introduced by a Syrian nomad.  \nHarps have been linked to ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian cultures, but were most popular in Egypt.  \n## Ancient Theatrical Performance  \n### Ancient Egypt  \nThe earliest form of theatre was thought to have begun as early as the 19th century BCE in Abydos, Egypt in religious ceremonies known as 'Passion Plays' whereby priests annually and ritually reenacted the Osiris myth in performances that traveled with Osiris' sacred barque on a roundtrip journey from his temple to his tomb and back. This processional festival brought travelers from the entirety of Egypt. Those who could afford to erected monuments to themselves along the route so that even in the afterlife they would still be able to participate in the festival. Performance in Egypt persisted for another millennia as described by the Rhind mortuary papyri which records the burial ceremonies of Menthesuphis and his wife who perished circa 9 BCE entailing a \"dramatic performance, with the priests assuming the roles of the gods.\" In these instances ritual is enacted through performance in order to join the realms of the living with the dead and also to create a space where the worlds of the living and dead could simultaneously merge as \"this complex festival culture connect(s) heaven, the earth, and the world of the dead\". Recurring festival performances were held annually or seasonally. As festival culture emerged, so too did the ritual performances or 'festival plays' that served the purpose of both associating the ruling king with the gods as exemplified in the Luxor feast which was annually performed as a \"cultic affirmation of the king as son of god (Amun)\", as well as during the Festival of Valley when the king associated himself with his forefathers in the cult of the 'ancestor gods' in order to \"assure himself of their blessings as the legitimate son of his bodily ancestors\". Traces of the Osiris Myth as performance archaeology have endured and can be seen in modern stories such as Hamlet and The Lion King.  \n### India  \nIn Classical India, theatre was used as a way to both provide a source of entertainment as well as to relay moral advice from their epic poetry. The Natya Shastra is a Sanskrit text dating back to the 5th century describing the performing arts. Episodes of the performances are depicted in sixty-two reliefs found within Prambanan temple located in Java. Music, dance and theatre were all closely interwoven within both the Hindu and Buddhist cultures. A scene from kabuki stage (1885?)  \n### Japan  \nKabuki  \n### Greece  \nAncient Greek tragedy has been linked to rituals stemming from the cult of Cult of Dionysus.  \n## Ancient dance  \nTomb of the Dancers, wall painting. 17th Dynasty, Thebes.  \nMusicians and dancers played important roles in ancient Egyptian performance. Elite women in ancient Egypt adorned their hips with trinkets including not only aesthetically pleasing ornamental gold, shells and jewels, but also noise-making trinkets that were thought to both ward off evil spirits and invoke the goddess Hathor and appeal to her sexual nature in order to promote fertility. Modern belly dance is thus a derivative of this older Egyptian practice. Through the archaeological record dancers can be seen in artwork such as the Tomb of the Dancers painting in Thebes.  \n<ImageHere>Procession of performers welcome child heir. Bonampak, Mexico.\nViolent war performances were reenacted in Mesoamerica by elaborately plumed war dancers. The representation of maize was personified by human/plant hybrid models which were utilized for ritual purposes. Dramatic enactments of this nature are presumed to have been used for the purpose of sympathetic magic in order to win in battle in the former instance, as well as to resurrect the spirit of the vegetation each Spring in the latter. A theatrical performance was reconstructed in Guatemala in 1543 CE that incorporated music along with the Dance of Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the Maya Hero Twins, which portrayed their descent into and resurrection from Xibalba. Theatrical performances also frequently incorporated both music and dance into a procession as exemplified on limestone murals found in Bonampak, Mexico. Here musicians playing drums, rattles and turtle shells accompany actors wearing bizarre costumes in an elaborate ceremony welcoming a child heir to the throne. Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions show people posed in \"highly-stylized gestures...explicitly labeled in accompanying text as 'dance'\" and are thought of as a form of sign language. Instruments used in Maya culture such as horns, turtle shells, drums and rattles can be found in their visual art.  \nAlessandra Lopez y Royo analogizes dance to poetry describing the karanas, or dance movements artistically portrayed on the temple walls, as the 'sentences' left for us to re-embody the 'vocabulary' of the dance. 'Contemporary dance' of Indian performance arts on the other hand is a \"distinct genre\" and can be interpreted as the product of Western or 'non-traditional' influence.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a representation of a cultural performance that includes both music and dance as a form of procession?\nChoice list: \nA.

It was the 11th edition of the event on the ATP and 4th on the WTA. It was classified as an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event on the 2012 ATP World Tour and a Premier Mandatory event on the 2012 WTA Tour. The clay courts used for the tournament were dyed blue to provide better contrast with the ball, which garnered controversy amongst players who found the dyeing made the surface too slippery and difficult to maneuver, putting defensive players at a disadvantage. Ion \u021airiac, the former Romanian ATP player and billionaire businessman who owns the tournament, instituted the use of the color.  \n## Points and prize money  \n### Point distribution  \n### Prize money  \n## ATP singles main-draw entrants  \n<ImageHere>Roger Federer became the first and only man to win a tournament on blue clay.\n\n\n### Seeds  \n* Rankings are as of April 30, 2012  \n### Other entrants  \nThe following players received wildcards into the main draw:  \n* ESP Guillermo Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez  \n* USA Ryan Harrison  \n* ESP Javier Mart\u00ed  \n* ESP Albert Monta\u00f1\u00e9s  \nThe following players received entry from the qualifying draw:  \n* RUS Igor Andreev  \n* ARG Federico Delbonis  \n* COL Alejandro Falla  \n* ESP Daniel Gimeno Traver  \n* COL Santiago Giraldo  \n* ROU Victor H\u0103nescu  \n* UKR Sergiy Stakhovsky  \n### Withdrawals  \n* USA Mardy Fish  \n* ARG Juan M\u00f3naco (ankle injury)  \n* GBR Andy Murray (back injury)  \n* JPN Kei Nishikori (stomach injury)  \n* USA Andy Roddick (hamstring injury)  \n* SWE Robin S\u00f6derling (mononucleosis)  \n* FRA Julien Benneteau (elbow, ankle and wrist injuries)  \n* POL \u0141ukasz Kubot  \n## ATP doubles main-draw entrants  \n### Seeds  \n* Rankings are as of April 30, 2012  \n### Other entrants  \nThe following pairs received wildcards into the doubles main draw:  \n* UKR Sergei Bubka / ESP Javier Mart\u00ed  \n* ESP Daniel Gimeno Traver / ESP Iv\u00e1n Navarro  \nThe following pair received entry as alternates:  \n* RUS Alex Bogomolov Jr. / ITA Fabio Fognini  \n### Withdrawals  \n* GER Philipp Kohlschreiber (adductor injury)  \n## WTA singles main-draw entrants  \n<ImageHere>Sara Errani serving.\n\n\n### Seeds  \n* Rankings are as of April 30, 2012  \n### Other entrants  \nThe following players received wildcards into the main draw:  \n* ESP Lara Arruabarrena Vecino  \n* ESP Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza Blanco  \n* ESP S\u00edlvia Soler Espinosa  \n* ESP Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro  \n* USA Venus Williams  \nThe following players received entry from the qualifying draw:  \n* USA Jill Craybas  \n* ESP Lourdes Dom\u00ednguez Lino  \n* CZE Andrea Hlav\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1  \n* CZE Lucie Hradeck\u00e1  \n* FRA Mathilde Johansson  \n* SWE Johanna Larsson  \n* USA Varvara Lepchenko  \n* AUS Anastasia Rodionova  \n### Withdrawals  \n* SVK Daniela Hantuchov\u00e1  \n* GER Sabine Lisicki (ankle injury)  \n* ITA Flavia Pennetta (wrist injury)  \n* GER Andrea Petkovic (ankle injury)  \n## WTA doubles main-draw entrants  \n### Seeds  \n* Rankings are as of April 30, 2012  \n#### Other entrants  \nThe following pairs received wildcards into the doubles main draw:  \n* SVK Dominika Cibulkov\u00e1 / SVK Janette Hus\u00e1rov\u00e1  \n* ESP Lourdes Dom\u00ednguez Lino / ESP Laura Pous Ti\u00f3  \n* RUS Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova / CZE Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1  \n* ESP S\u00edlvia Soler Espinosa / ESP Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro  \n## Finals  \n### Men's singles  \nRoger Federer defeated CZE Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych, 3\u20136, 7\u20135, 7\u20135  \n* It was Federer's fourth singles title of the year (out of four finals), and the 74th of his career.

He was a member of the Kapitsa family, a scientific dynasty in Russia.  \nKapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of Lake Vostok in the region of Vostok Station in Antarctica, based on seismic soundings of the thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet. These measures were obtained during the Soviet Antarctic Expeditions, in four of which Kapitsa participated. The discovery of Lake Vostok was one of the last major geographic discoveries.  \n## Early life  \nAndrey Kapitsa's father was Nobel Prize-winning physicist Pyotr Kapitsa, and his maternal grandfather was mathematician and naval engineer Aleksey Krylov. Pyotr Kapitsa's sons Sergey and Andrey were born in Cambridge, United Kingdom, where their father was conducting research.  \nAndrey graduated from Moscow State University, Faculty of Geography, in 1953. He worked in the Laboratory of Experimental Geomorphology at the faculty since.  \n## Antarctic research and discovery of Lake Vostok  \n<ImageHere>Location of Lake Vostok in East Antarctica\nIn 1958 Kapitsa defended his Candidate of Sciences thesis \"Morphology of East Antarctic Ice Sheet\" (\u00ab\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0434\u044b\u00bb), and in 1968 he defended his Doctor of Science thesis \"Subglacial relief of Antarctica\" (\u00ab\u041f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u0451\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0444 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0434\u044b\u00bb). Kapitsa was a participant in four Soviet Antarctic Expeditions between 1955 and 1964.  \nAt the end of the 19th century Russian scientist Peter Kropotkin proposed the idea of the existence of fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was later developed by Russian glaciologist I.A Zotikov, who wrote his PhD thesis on this subject in 1967.  \nAndrey Kapitsa used seismic soundings in the region of Vostok Station made during the Soviet Antarctic Expeditions in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet, discovering two spikes of reflection (one from bedrock and another from the sediment layer). Kapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of a subglacial lake in this region, which came to be known as Lake Vostok. The lake was named after Vostok Station, which in turn had been named after the Vostok, the 900-ton corvette of the discoverer of Antarctica, Russian explorer Admiral Fabian von Bellingshausen. The word \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a means \"east\" in Russian, and the name of the station and the lake also reflects the fact that they are located in the East of Antarctica.\n<ImageHere>Satellite image of Lake Vostok by NASA\nBy 1993, the research of Russian and British scientists confirmed the existence of the lake, and subsequent research established its features. Other subglacial lakes were also discovered.\n\n## Later career  \nKapitsa was the dean of his alma mater MSU Faculty of Geography in 1966\u20131970. In 1967\u20131969 he was the leader of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Expedition in the East Africa. He was elected into the ranks of the Academy in 1970 and was honored with a 1971 USSR State Prize and 1972 MSU's Dmitry Anuchin Prize for the creation of the Atlas of Antarctica. He supported the theory of natural causes behind the Antarctic ozone hole as well as the theory of natural reasons behind global warming.  \nKapitsa died in Moscow on 2 August 2011 at the age of 80. Half a year later, on 6 February 2012, after twenty years of drilling, a team of Russian scientists completed the longest ever ice core of 3,768 meters and pierced the Antarctic ice shield to reach the surface of Lake Vostok.  \n## Family  \n* Father \u2013 Pyotr Kapitsa \u2013 a leading Soviet physicist and Nobel Prize in Physics winner for his low temperature research, discoverer of superfluidity.  \n* Mother \u2013 Anna Alekseevna Krylova, daughter of A.N.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Dave Matthews Band Chicago River incident  \n<ImageHere>Kinzie Street Bridge (front), the location of the incident\nOn August 8, 2004, a tour bus belonging to the Dave Matthews Band dumped an estimated kg of human waste from the bus's blackwater tank through the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago onto a passenger sightseeing boat sailing in the Chicago River below.  \nAs part of a 2005 legal settlement, the band agreed to pay $200,000 to environmental protection and other projects (r=-3). The band also donated $100,000 to two groups that protect the river and the surrounding area (r=-3). The band's bus driver, Stefan Wohl, pleaded guilty to dumping the waste in April 2005.\n\n## Background  \nThe Dave Matthews Band had booked rooms at the Peninsula Hotel of 108 E. Superior Street for a two-night show at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. The incident occurred between the first and second night of the concert. The band booked five buses for its show; Stefan Wohl drove the bus of the band's violinist Boyd Tinsley.  \nDuring warm months, the Chicago Architecture Center offers a boat tour of the buildings along the Chicago River. The boats have open-roof seating, where passengers sit during the tour.  \n<ImageHere>The riveted grate surface of the bridge allows liquids to pass through. The Chicago River is visible through the holes in the grate.\nMost Chicago bridges feature riveted grating, which is used for its strength and anti-slip properties. Riveted grating allows rain, snow, and other liquids to pass through, removing the need for complicated drainage systems or to salt the bridge deck during snow, and assuring it does not ice over in wintry weather.\n\n## Incident  \nOn Sunday, August 8, 2004, at 1:18 p.m., Wohl was alone in Tinsley's bus and driving to a downtown hotel when he emptied the bus' blackwater tank as it crossed the metal grates of the Kinzie Street bridge.  \nPassenger boat Chicago's Little Lady was hosting the 1 p.m. Chicago Architecture Foundation tour of the Chicago River. While passing under the bridge, the boat received the full contents of the tank on the seats of its open-roof terrace. Roughly two-thirds of the 120 passengers aboard the tour boat were soaked. The boat immediately returned to its dock, where all passengers were issued refunds. Five passengers went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for testing. According to the Illinois Attorney General, passengers aboard included persons with disabilities, elderly, a pregnant woman, a small child, and an infant. The filing describes the incident:  \nThe boat's deck was swabbed by its crew, and service was resumed for its scheduled 3 p.m. tour.  \n## Aftermath  \nImmediately following the incident, the Chicago Police Department said they were investigating the incident but did not yet consider it a crime. On August 9, the Chicago Architecture Foundation released a statement that a witness had recorded license plate information, which they had turned over to the police as evidence. On August 10, bus driver Jerry Fitzpatrick, who drove for the band, was identified as the owner of the bus's license plate. In a phone interview, Fitzpatrick denied to a Chicago Tribune reporter that he had dumped the waste, asserting that he was parked in front of the band's hotel at the time. A publicist for the Dave Matthews Band issued a statement saying the band's management had determined that every one of its buses was parked at the time of the incident.  \nFitzpatrick, who was in Effingham, Illinois, at the time, instructed Sgt. Paul Gardner of the Effingham Police Department to inspect the bus's septic tank to prove that he could not have emptied it. Gardner reported to the Chicago Tribune over Fitzpatrick's cell phone that he had inspected the tank, and that it was nearly full.  \nState prosecutors worked with a nearby fitness gym, the East Bank Club, to identify the offending bus based on the gym's security videotapes. On August 24, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a $70,000 lawsuit against Wohl, alleging that he was responsible for the dumping. Wohl denied dumping the waste, and was supported by the band. On August 25, Mayor Richard M. Daley held a press conference in which he released the videotape used as evidence. Daley, himself a fan of the band, expressed his belief that the dumping was \"absolutely unacceptable\".  \nIn March 2005, Wohl pleaded guilty to reckless conduct and discharging contaminants to cause water pollution. The Dave Matthews Band did not immediately apologize for previously supporting Wohl. He was sentenced to 150 hours of community service, fined $10,000 to be paid to Friends of the Chicago River, an environmental organization, and received 18 months probation. The Dave Matthews Band donated $50,000 to the Chicago Park District, $50,000 to Friends of the Chicago River, and paid the State of Illinois $200,000 in settlement. The Dave Matthews Band agreed to keep a log when its buses empty their septic tanks.  \nIt is believed that Wohl did not realize that there was a boat underneath the bridge when he dumped the waste. No passengers suffered any long-lasting physical health effects from having the waste dumped on them.  \nOn August 8, 2023, the Riot Fest Historical Society attached a plaque to the Kinzie Street Bridge commemorating the 19th anniversary of the incident.\n\nQuestion: What feature of the Kinzie Street Bridge played a role in the incident involving the Dave Matthews Band's tour bus in 2004?\nChoice list: \nA.

He became President of Queens' College at the University of Cambridge from 1529 to 1537, and toward the end of his life, was installed Canon of Windsor at Windsor Castle.\n\n## Life  \n<ImageHere>Exeter Cathedral, where Simon Heynes assumed the role of Dean of Exeter\nHaynes was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1516, was elected fellow of his college in 1516, proceeded M.A. in 1519, and had a title for orders from Queens' College in February 1521. He took part in the expulsion of Dr. John Jennins from the presidency of Queens' in 1518, and in 1528 was himself elected president. Being empowered by the college to make bargains and covenants at his discretion, he alienated some of the estates belonging to the society.  \nOn 28 November 1528 Haynes was instituted to the rectory of Barrow, Suffolk. He was one of the delegates appointed by the senate to make a determination as to the king's divorce in 1529\u201330; commenced D.D. in 1531, and in 1532\u20133 and 1533\u20134 served the office of Vice-chancellor. On 23 May 1533 he attested Archbishop Thomas Cranmer's instrument of divorce at Dunstable, implicating Catherine of Aragon, and in 1534 was admitted vicar of Stepney, Middlesex. During that year he and Bishop John Skip, the chaplain of Queen Anne Boleyn, were selected by the court to preach at Cambridge against papal supremacy.  \nIn 1535 Haynes was sent with diplomat Christoper Mount, an agent of Thomas Cromwell, to France as an Ambassador. The aim was to convince reformer Philip Melanchthon, a collaborator of Martin Luther, to come back to England. The mission eventually failed but they kept good contact. At the end of the same year he was instituted to the rectory of Fulham, Middlesex, and on 24 December was installed canon of Windsor at Windsor Castle.  \nOn 16 July 1537 he was elected Dean of Exeter, and in that capacity he attended the baptism of Prince Edward Tudor; and soon afterwards resigned the presidency of Queens' College. A letter in condemnation of the bill of the Six Articles, addressed by him to a member of parliament, is printed in John Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials.  \nIn 1538 Haynes and Edmund Bonner, the  Bishop of London, were sent to Spain, and joined Sir Thomas Wyatt, the Ambassador there. Offended by Wyatt's treatment of them, they later charged him with holding traitorous correspondence with Cardinal Reginald Pole and speaking disrespectfully of the king. Haynes signed the decree of 9 July 1540 invalidating the marriage of Henry VIII with Anne of Cleves, and on the following 17 Dec. the king made him one of the first prebendaries of Westminster.  \nHaynes was a visitor of the university of Oxford, the college of Windsor, and Exeter Cathedral, and one of the commissioners against the Anabaptists. He also assisted in the compilation of the first English liturgy.

The Whispers arranged and learned the song Fine By Me in 8 hours for their final video submission. To gain votes, the Whispers got support of both the WashU newspaper Studlife and the St. Louis Metro social media staff. While they won the popular vote (consisting of Facebook Likes, Tweets, and user account votes) in their final round, they ultimately lost to the professional a cappella group Six Appeal, who garnered the votes of both TopBlip and Grammer himself.  \n## International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella  \n<ImageHere>Senior William Skubish solos on Harry Styles' \"Music for a Sushi Restaurant\" at the 2023 Midwest Semifinal.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Products of conception  \n<ImageHere>Micrograph of products of conception. Chorionic villi (right of image) and cartilage, i.e. fetal parts (left of image). H&E stain.\nProducts of conception, abbreviated POC, is a medical term used for the tissue derived from the union of an egg and a sperm. It encompasses anembryonic gestation (blighted ovum) which does not have a viable embryo.  \nIn the context of tissue from a dilation and curettage, the presence of POC essentially excludes an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n## Retained products of conception  \nRetained products of conception is where products of conception remain in the uterus after childbirth, medical abortion or miscarriage (also known as spontaneous abortion). Miscarriage with retained products of conception is termed delayed when no or very little products of conception have been passed, and incomplete when some products have been passed but some still remain in utero.  \n## Diagnosis  \n<ImageHere>On gross pathology, the presence of chorionic villi (left) is diagnostic of products of conception, whereas decidua (right) is not.\nThe diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, quantitative HCG, ultrasound, and pathologic evaluation. A solid, heterogeneous, echogenic mass has a positive predictive value of 80%, but is present in only a minority of cases. A thickened endometrium of > 10\u00a0mm is usually considered abnormal, though no consensus exists on the appropriate cutoff. A cut-off of 8\u00a0mm or more has 34% positive rate, while a cut off of 14\u00a0mm or more has 85% sensitivity, 64% specificity for the diagnosis. Color Doppler flow in the endometrial canal can increased confidence in the diagnosis, though its absence does not exclude it, as 40% of cases of retained products have little or no flow. The differential in suspected cases includes uterine atony, blood clot, gestational trophoblastic disease, and normal post partum appearance of the uterus. Post partum blood clot is more common, reported in up to 24% of postpartum patients, and tends to be more hypoechoic than retained products with absent color flow on Doppler, and resolving spontaneously on follow up scans. The presence of gas raises the possibility of post partum endometritis, though this can also be seen in up to 21% of normal post pregnancy states. The normal post partum uterus is usually less than 2\u00a0cm in thickness, and continues to involute on follow up scans to 7\u00a0mm or less over time. Retained products are not uncommon, occurring in approximately 1% of all pregnancies, though it more common following abortions, either elective or spontaneous. There is significant overlap between appearance of a normal post partum uterus and retained products.  If there is no endometrial canal mass or fluid, and endometrial thickness is less than 10\u00a0mm and without increased flow, retained products are statistically unlikely.\n\n### Infections  \nRecent studies indicate that the products of conception may be susceptible to pathogenic infections, including viral infections. Indeed, footprints of JC polyomavirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus have been detected in chorionic villi from females affected by spontaneous abortion as well as pregnant women. Another virus, BK polyomavirus has been detected in the same tissues, but with lesser extent.  \n## Treatment  \n### After medical abortion  \nAccording to the 2006 WHO Frequently asked clinical questions about medical abortion, the presence of remaining products of conception in the uterus (as detected by obstetric ultrasonography) after a medical abortion is not an indication for surgical intervention (that is, vacuum aspiration or dilation and curettage). Remaining products of conception will be expelled during subsequent vaginal bleeding. Still, surgical intervention may be carried out on the woman's request, if the bleeding is heavy or prolonged, or causes anemia, or if there is evidence of endometritis.  \n### In delayed miscarriage  \nIn delayed miscarriage (also called missed abortion), the Royal Women's Hospital recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:  \n* Gestational sac greater than 30-35mm, embryo larger than ~25mm (corresponding to 9+0 weeks of gestational age): Surgery is recommended. It poses a high risk of pain and bleeding with passage of products of conception. Alternative methods may still be considered.  \n* Gestational sac 15-35mm, embryo smaller than 25mm (corresponding to between 7 and 9+0 weeks of gestational age): Medication is recommended. Surgery or expectant management may be considered.  \n* Gestational sac smaller than 15-20mm, corresponding to a gestational age of less than 7 weeks: Expectant management or medication is preferable. The products of conception may be difficult to find surgically with a considerable risk of failed surgical procedure.  \n### In incomplete miscarriage  \nIn incomplete miscarriage, the Royal Women's Hospital recommendations of management depend on the findings in ultrasonography:  \n* Retained products of conception smaller than 15mm: Expectant management is generally preferable. There is a high chance of spontaneous expulsion.  \n* Retained products of conception measuring between 15 and 20mm: Medical or expectant management are recommended. Surgery should only be considered upon specific indication.  \n* At retained products of conception measuring over 35 to 50mm, the following measures are recommended:  \n* Administration of misoprostol to hasten passage of products of conception.  \n* Admission to inpatient care for observation for a few hours or overnight until the majority of the products of conception has passed and bleeding subsided.  \n* After apparent failure of misoprostol, a gynecologic examination should be done prior to considering surgical evacuation of the uterus or the patient leaving the\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is supported by the information provided in the images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA. Chorionic villi are indicative of an ectopic pregnancy.\nB. The presence of decidua alone is diagnostic of products of conception.\nC.

On January 5, 2013, Hayward played in his first career playoff game and collected four solo tackles in the 24\u201310 win against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Wildcard game. The Packers were defeated 45\u201331 by the San Francisco 49ers the following game. Hayward earned the highest overall grade of any slot corner ever graded by Pro Football Focus.\n\n#### 2013  \nDefensive coordinator Dom Capers and cornerbacks coach Joe Whitt Jr. held an open competition to name the starting cornerbacks for the regular season. Davon House, Tramon Williams, Sam Shields, and Hayward all competed for the starting roles. He fell behind in training camp following a hamstring injury that sidelined him for two weeks. Head coach Mike McCarthy named Hayward the third cornerback behind Williams and Shields to begin the regular season.  \nOn August 23, 2013, Hayward returned for the third preseason game and recorded a tackle, a pass deflection, and made an interception before leaving the 17\u201310 loss to the Seattle Seahawks after aggravating his hamstring injury.

Hayward led all Packers' cornerbacks in tackles and with 908 snaps on defense.  \n#### 2016  \nHayward became an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career after the Green Bay Packers decided not to offer him a new contract despite a career-high number of tackles and starts in 2015. The decision surprised Hayward and Aaron Rodgers but was considered reasonable by members of Packers media coverage. He received interest from a few teams, including the San Francisco 49ers, Arizona Cardinals, Dallas Cowboys,  \nand San Diego Chargers.  \n### San Diego / Los Angeles Chargers  \n#### 2016  \nOn March 13, 2016, the San Diego Chargers signed Hayward to a three-year, $15.30 million contract that includes $6.80 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.50 million.  \nThroughout training camp, Hayward competed for the job as the starting outside cornerback against Brandon Flowers.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Madonna performing \"Nobody Knows Me\" during the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004\nThe song received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised the song as one of the best tracks of the album, calling it \"infectious\". Sean O'Brien from The People praised \"Nobody Knows Me\" as \"the best song of the album\" and her \"one of her best ever\". He also said that the song is one of the reasons why Madonna is queen of pop. Jon Pareles from The New York Times considered it as the album's most danceable song. Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, called the song \"dazed-sounding\". Metro Times described Ahmadzai's programming as \"by far the best thing on the album\". James Hannaham from Spin compared \"Nobody Knows Me\" to Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\", and deemed it as a highlight from the album. Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was \"insane\" with its electronic, chaotic, fast and manic pounding synths. \"There is so much going on here several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace.\" Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described \"Nobody Knows Me\" as the \"downright thrilling\" and \"deploys a shrewd little form-versus-content paradox\".  \nSpence D. from IGN Music commented that the song is the coolest song on the album up to this point. Paul Rees from Q magazine complemented the track as a \"conventional rock song, filled with drama, darkness and surprises\". USA Todays Edna Gunderson said that the \"funkified\" synth-pop of \"Nobody Knows Me\" attests to Madonna's \"undiminished\" skills as a shrewd pop composer. Yahoo! Music's Dan Genoe commented that Madonna has a personality crisis in the song. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice gave the song a mixed review, writing: \"It mutes slightly the slaphappy beats of Mirwais's own club hit \"Disco Science\" to make vague digs at the press and defensively vow self-improvement. Madonna's voice is mixed and diced into baby gurgles, which might have been cute if it weren't so redundant.\" John Payne from LA Weekly deduced that even within the synth sounds of the song, he could see \"real feeling deeply ingrained in this particular icon. 'Why should I care what the world thinks of me?' That is, yes, she does care what the world thinks of her. She says she\u2019ll just withdraw from the public eye, \u2019cause who needs this, huh?\" Conversely, Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, gave a negative review saying that \"Nobody Knows Me\" might be the silliest track that Madonna had ever recorded.\n\n## Chart performance  \nThe song, along with \"Nothing Fails\", topped the Hot Dance Singles Sales while the Peter Rauhofer remix peaked at number four on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. According to Fred Bronson, the single release of the remixes of the song debuted at number-one on the Hot Singles Sales and Hot Dance Single Sales chart, on the issue dated December 27, 2003, the same week it also moved up to the top-twenty of the Dance Club Play chart. \"Me Against the Music\" by Britney Spears, on which Madonna was featured, and \"Nobody Knows Me\", both were also present in the top-twenty, making Madonna the only artist to have three songs within the top-twenty on the chart simultaneously. At the year-end Hot Dance Singles Sales recap, \"Nothing Fails / Nobody Knows Me\" was at number two position, while \"Me Against the Music\" and \"Love Profusion\" was at numbers one and three respectively. Billboard reported that Madonna was the first artist in its chart history to have the top three Dance Sales song. In Australia, the Peter Rauhofer/Above & Beyond Remix debuted at number\u00a080 on the ARIA Club Tracks, peaking at number\u00a049 the next week.  \n## Live performances  \n<ImageHere>Dancers practicing slacklining during the video interlude of \"Nobody Knows Me\", which morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, on the MDNA Tour in 2012\nMadonna performed the song during the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, as the second song on the opening segment of the show. \"Nobody Knows Me\" was rehearsed with the Peter Rauhofer's Private Life remix. According to Dirk Timmerman, author of Madonna Live! Secret Re-inventions and Confessions on Tour, Madonna lip-synched the performance. During this section, the singer wore a jewel encrusted corset, created by designer Christian Lacroix. After the opening number, \"Vogue\", she started an energetic version of the song, on a conveyor belt with some laser light words appearing on the backdrop screens behind her. It also features a giant catwalk lowered from the ceiling. After this performance, she performed \"Frozen\" alone on stage. The performance of \"Nobody Knows Me\" was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.  \nThe song was later added as a video interlude on the MDNA Tour in 2012, as a tribute to Tyler Clementi and other teens who had committed suicide due to bullying. The film, which was created by Swedish director Johan S\u00f6derberg, morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, including then-Chinese President Hu Jintao, US Republican former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Pope Benedict XVI. The face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen appeared on the screen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead, before it morphed into the face of Adolf Hitler. Socialist French government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem had also expressed her disappointment. However, Madonna kept the video unchanged on this date, prompting Le Pen to file a lawsuit against her. A spokesman for Le Pen said a lawsuit for \"public insult\" would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. Madonna responded to the lawsuit saying \"I know that I made a certain Marine Le Pen very angry with me. And it's not my intention to make enemies.\" She later explained in an interview with Brazilian network Rede Globo, that the sequence was about \"intolerance that we human beings have for one another. And how much we judge people before knowing them. That's why it's done in the song 'Nobody Knows Me.'\" During her concert in Nice, France, the swastika was removed and was replaced by a question mark. The performance was included on Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.\n\n## Formats and track listings  \n* \"Nothing Fails\" \u2013 US CD maxi-single  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Peter Rauhofer's Classic House Mix) \u2013 8:24  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Nevins Big Room Rock Mix) \u2013 6:44  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Tracy Young's Underground Mix) \u2013 7:29  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Nevins Global Dub) \u2013 7:45  \n-  \"Nothing Fails\" (Jackie's In Love In The Club Mix) \u2013 7:28  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Peter Rauhofer's Private Life Part 1) \u2013 8:07  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Above & Beyond 12\" Mix) \u2013 8:45  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Mount Sims Italo Kiss Mix) \u2013 5:26  \n* US promo vinyl single  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Peter Rauhofer's Private Life Mix Part 1) \u2013 8:07  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Mount Sims Old School Mix) \u2013 4:46  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Above & Beyond 12\" Mix) \u2013 8:50  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Mount Sims Italo Kiss Mix) \u2013 5:25  \n* Digital video single  \n-  \"Music\" (Live) \u2013 2:31  \n-  \"Nobody Knows Me\" (Live) \u2013 3:36  \n## Credits and personnel  \n* Madonna \u2013 lead vocals, background vocals, songwriter, producer  \n* Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef \u2013 songwriter, producer, guitars, programming  \n* Tim Young \u2013 audio mastering  \n* Mark \"Spike\" Stent \u2013 audio mixing  \nCredits for \"Nobody Knows Me\" are adapted from American Life liner notes.  \n## Charts  \n### Weekly charts  \n### Year-end charts\n\nQuestion: Which tour featured Madonna performing \"Nobody Knows Me\" with a video interlude that included the morphing of her face with various famous figures?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\n<ImageHere>Thomas Hodgkin's presentation in tabular form of the Historia Brittonums version of the Frankish Table of Nations.\nThe thirteen nations selected for inclusion in the Table are contemporary with the author. The selection is not derived from Tacitus nor does it include any anachronistic names. If it is an attempt to list the Germanic peoples, then the author conceives of the Romans and Bretons as Germans. Possibly the author considered Germani to be synonymous with Westerners or Europeans, although the Vandals lived in Africa at the time.  \nThe first two nations named\u2014the Goths without any qualifier and the Walagoths, that is, foreign Goths\u2014represent the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths. Most likely, the Ostrogoths are the first and the Visigoths the second. It is probable that a Germanic-speaking editor in the Frankish kingdom replaced the by then rare term Visigoths with a Germanic gloss. \"Foreign\" in this case means \"Romance-speaking\" and refers to the \"romanized\" Visigoths of Spain and southern Gaul. Herwig Wolfram glosses the term as \"Roman Goths\" and Wadden as \"Welsh Goths\".  \nThe assignment of the contemporary nations to Tacitean categories was made on the basis of Tacitus' descriptions. The author of the Table took \"those of the centre\" to mean the most prominent and assigned the most prominent nations of his time to the first group, the Herminones. These, minus the Saxons, form a quartet common in Byzantine literature. Procopius in On the Wars defines the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths and Gepids as the \"Gothic nations\" that \"all came originally from one tribe\". The same quartet is also found in Cyril of Scythopolis' Life of Sabbas, written about 556. They were all Arian Christians and major enemies of the Byzantine Empire in the early 6th century. Besides the Table, Theophanes the Confessor (c. 800), Landolfus Sagax (c. 1000) and Nikephoros Kallistos (c. 1320) all preserve this quartet of nations from early Byzantine historiography. The Saxons are thought to be a later addition to the Table by a Frankish editor.  \nThe second group, the Ingaevones, are those nearest the ocean, taken to be the nations north of Italy and east of Gaul. The remainder were the westernmost nations, a miscellany of Germanic and non-Germanic peoples that make up the third group. They represent the peoples of the Frankish kingdoms. It is possibly significant that the Table was composed shortly after the death of Clovis I (511), founder of the Merovingian Frankish kingdom when its continued cohesion was in question and its component peoples may have appeared more independent.  \nThe use of the Table in the Carolingian Empire can be read as part of an effort to integrate Roman and Frankish history. There is a parallel between the placement of the Franks, Britons and Romans as brothers in the Table and the claims of each of those people to Trojan ancestry: the Romans through Aeneas, the Merovingians through Francus and the Britons through Brutus (Britto). The only copy of the Table that connects it directly with the Trojan claims, however, is that found in the Historia, which is also the only one that connects it with the generations of Noah.  \nThe introduction of the Tuscans in place of the Thuringians first occurs in manuscript M from the early 10th century and was followed in E, written around 1005. The change has been linked to the creation of a distinct regional Tuscan identity after the fall of the Lombard Kingdom in 774. The copyist of E, who probably had both versions to choose from, chose the Tuscan version because enhanced contacts between the Lombard south of Italy and Tuscany in his day. Willa and Gemma, the daughters of Prince Landulf IV of Benevento and Capua (982), married prominent members of the Tuscan families Aldobrandeschi and Cadolingi. E also includes the Capua Chronicle, which gives a starring role to Marquis Hugh of Tuscany for his intervention in Capua in 993 following the murder of Prince Landenulf II.  \nAll versions of the Historia Brittonum interpose between the brothers and the nations invented names for the founding fathers of the nations, mimicking the decision of the original author of the Table to create names for the brothers based on the names of their peoples. The intervening layer reads:  \nHessitio autem habuit filios quattuor: hi sunt Francus, Romanus, Britto, Albanus. Armenon autem habuit quinque filios: Gothus, Valagothus, Gebidus, Burgundus, Longobardus. Negue autem habuit tres filios: Wandalus, Saxo, Boguarus.  \nHessitio had four sons, Francus, Romanus, Britto and Albanus; Armenon had five sons, Gothus, Walagothus, Gepidus, Burgundus, Langobardus; Negue had three sons, Vandalus, Saxo, Bavarus.  \nSome versions have Alemannus instead of Albanus. The Gaelic versions of the Table derived from the Historia drop the nations entirely, retaining only the brothers and their sons. They also have Albanus. Scholars are divided on the intended referent of the Albani, the descendants of Albanus. A connection with the \"Scythian\" Albani of Asia, mentioned in the 7th-century Etymologies of Isidore, is possible but unlikely. A Scythian origin for the Picts of northern Britain was proposed by Bede in the 8th century, probably based on Isidore, and became the centerpiece of the 12th-century Cronica de origine antiquorum Pictorum. Chronological considerations also exclude reference to the Balkan Albanians. Dumville argues that the Italian city of Alba Longa, whose inhabitants are called Albani elsewhere in the Historia, is meant. This city had an important role in the legend of Rome's founding. Evans considers it most likely that the Albani are the people of Alba (Scotland) and that a Welsh scribe updated the Table in the same way that a contemporary Italian scribe did: by replacing a more distant and less relevant people with one closer to home. It is less likely that the Albani are the inhabitants of Albion (Britain), since in that case they would be redundant to the Britti. The Gaelic version of the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, however, specifies that Albanus' brother founded Alba Letha (\"Albania on the Continent\") and its author probably had in mind either Scythian Albania or Alba Longa. Edward Cowan translates it \"Albanians of Latium in Italy\". The Sex aetates mundi is even clearer: the Albani are from \"the eastern Albania in great Asia\" (ind Albain airtherach isind Asia m\u00f3ir).\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts and images, which of the following statements is true regarding the Frankish Table of Nations and its origins?\nChoice list: \nA.

Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.\nSeveral explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word Malkin.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.\n\n## Toponymy  \nThe name Malkin has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;ps=none the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.ps=none Malkin was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin,ps=none and was an old northern English name for a hare,ps=none into which witches were said to be able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,ps=none which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.ps=none Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln,ps=none which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.ps=none  \nAuthors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raidersps=none or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,ps=none but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.ps=none Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,ps=none and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.ps=none It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.ps=none  \nMalkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,ps=none or Mocking Tower.ps=none  \n## Association with witches  \nOn Good Friday, 10 April 1612,ps=none Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.ps=none The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device,ps=none two of the alleged Pendle witches.  \nOn 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.ps=none She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.ps=none Both were arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.ps=none  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's \"mentally sub-normal\" brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.ps=none Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York.ps=none  \n## Location  \nThe location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.ps=none It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials. The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the \"melancholy associations\" of the place.ps=none The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former royal forest that covered a considerable area south and east of Pendle Hill, extending almost to the towns of Burnley, Colne and Padiham.  \n<ImageHere>alt=Prominent structure on a hill\nOne contender is in the civil parish of Blacko, on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;ps=none since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.ps=none In The Lancashire Witch-Craze, Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and Gisburn.ps=none Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn public house; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.ps=none The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.ps=none It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the manor of Colne as Mawkin Yarde, described as being \"in the north of Colne\",ps=none but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.ps=none  \nIn 1891 local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.ps=none Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.ps=none  \nAnother possible location is somewhere near the village of Newchurch in Pendle.ps=none Douglas claims there is \"persuasive\" evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, Barley and Roughlee.ps=none Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.ps=none  \nArchaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.ps=none A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to Lower Black Moss reservoir near Barley.\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the information provided, which statement is true regarding Malkin Tower?\nChoice list: \nA.

They share a common interest in the techniques of financial management, financial accounting, reporting and maintaining business enterprises on a healthy basis in the face of changing business conditions. Membership of national institutes is typically open to financial executives or those performing policy setting functions in large and medium size companies, depending upon the national context and local institute bylaws. In many, but not all institutes, members may also include professionals and experts working in allied fields, such as audit and advisory services firms, financial services organizations, and scholars and academics.  \n## IAFEI Technical Working Committees  \nIAFEI's Technical Working Committees are composed of experts around the world engaged in sharing technical knowledge in key domains of interest to senior financial professionals. Among the global committees are:  \n* International Observatory of Management Control  \n* International Tax Committee  \n* International Treasury Committee  \n* IFRS Committee  \n## IAFEI officers and executive committee  \n* Chairman: Luis Ortiz-Hidalgo (IMEF-Mexico)  \n* Vice Chairman: Fausto Cosi (ANDAF-Italy)  \n* Secretary: Victor Y.

At this event a new head organization for national institutes was created, with a legal situs in Switzerland. At the second world congress (Brussels in 1970), 55 representatives of 15 member institutes finalized the creation of the association. IAFEI was founded by the financial executives institutes of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Spain, United Kingdom and the combined institutes of the United States of America and Canada (today: FEI - Financial Executives International), which played a key role.  \n## IAFEI World Congress  \n<ImageHere>Marek Belka, president of the Polish National Bank at the gala dinner at the 43rd IAFEI World Congress in Warsaw, October 2013\nThe IAFEI World Congress is an annual congress organized on behalf of the IAFEI. The two to four day congress, which includes a gala dinner, is hosted by one of IAFEI's national member institutes. The congress, which is organized for corporate finance executives from all over the world, is normally held with the national convention of the hosting institute.  \nThe first congress of international finance executives institutes was held in 1969 in Marbella, Spain. IAFEI World Congresses have since been held in 21 different countries.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Flavian art  \n<ImageHere>The Arch of Titus\nFlavian art is the artistic production of the Roman Empire during the Flavian dynasty (emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian) from 69 to 96 AD.  \nAlready at the time of Claudius and Nero, the style of sculpture began to separate itself from the neo-Attic Athenian art that dominated the late Republic. This style was almost definitively abandoned under the Flavian dynasty. It is not fully known what the catalyst for this change was.  \nTwo major trends emerged in sculpture: the use of a more nuanced chiaroscuro in the bas-relief, and the use of placing the figures in a three-dimensional space with regards to the perspective of the viewer.\n\n## Arch of Titus  \nRelief of the procession on the Arch of Titus  \nThe greatest symbol of the Flavian era is the Arch of Titus, dated between 81 and 90. The architecture is denser and heavier than the arches of the Augustan era, such as the Arch of Susa. This is a clear deviation from the traditional Hellenistic influence. Here for the first time in Rome the Ionic/Corinthian Composite order appears, a more ornamental style. The numerous internal reliefs of the archway are extraordinarily significant and show two moments of the triumphal procession which took place in 71 after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus.date=August 2020  \nIn these pieces, we see the innovation of Roman relief. Evident are the thickened figures, with the height of the figures consistent with their location in space. Individual figures are represented as if they were moving within three dimensions. Furthermore, the figures do not move on a straight line, but on a convex curved line, clearly visible in the relief of the procession. On the left it appears the figures are moving towards the viewer, and on the far right, moving away as they enter under the Porta Triumphalis. This trend continued to be developed further during the Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty.  \n## Other sculptures  \nThis era saw the commission of the Cancelleria Reliefs likely by Domitian, constructed around 90. These are imbued with classicism found in the era of Claudius, but also display the arrangement of the figures along a convex line.  \n## Architecture  \n<ImageHere>The Colosseum, constructed between 70 and 80\nThe Great Fire of Rome in 64 destroyed much of the city, making it necessary to rebuild. New squares were opened, the streets became wider and lined with arcades, and houses were constructed to a more limited height. Domitian rebuilt the burnt monuments at the Campus Martius, plus the Piazza Navona and the Odeon of Domitian.  \nThe Flavian dynasty, in particular under Domitian, oversaw the monumentalization of the Palatine Hill. The emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero all had residences on the hill, but the most grandiose palace was built by Domitian. The Palace of Domitian, constructed by the architect Rabirius, had at least three parts; the Domus Flavia, the Domus Augustana, and the gardens.  \nArchitectural development in the Flavian era was of fundamental importance for the implementation of new techniques. This period saw an increase in the use of the hemispherical domes (Domus Transitoria, the nymphaeum at the Villa of Domitian), the development of rib vaults (the Colosseum), the use of ogives with brick arches in series, and the development of barrel vaults, which reach 33 meters in diameter in the Domitian vestibule of the Roman Forum.\n\n\nQuestion: Which architectural innovation is commonly associated with the Flavian dynasty and can be seen in the design of the Colosseum?\nChoice list: \nA. The extensive use of the Doric order\nB. The development of rib vaults\nC. The introduction of Gothic arches\nD. The creation of the Corinthian capital\nYour answer is: ",

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Austrian linguistic map from 1896. In green the areas where Slavs were the majority of the population, in orange the areas where Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians were the majority of the population. The boundaries of Venetian Dalmatia in 1797 are delimited with blue dots.\nItaly joined World War I in 1915 on the side of the Allies, after negotiating the secret Treaty of London with the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia). According to the secret pacts of London, the following territories were promised to Italy in case of victory: Trentino and South Tyrol, the Austrian Littoral (Trieste, Gorizia and Gradisca, and Istria), territories in Dalmatia, a protectorate over Albania with direct control of Vlora, and compensations in case of a colonial partition of the Central Powers' empires. The content of the pact of London was made public in 1917 by the Russians, following their withdrawal from the War after the communist revolution, in order to criticize the \"old diplomacy\" of the capitalist European powers. While France and Britain remained bound by the treaty of London, the US president Woodrow Wilson (who joined the Allies in 1917) opposed it and presented on January 8, 1918 fourteen points to redraw the map of Europe on the basis of nationality and ethnicity. During the decisive Italian offensive, the nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio coined the term mutilated victory by publishing an article in the Corriere della Sera dated October 24, 1918 and titled \"Our victory will not be mutilated\".  \nItaly's prime minister Vittorio Orlando, one of the Big Four of World War I, and his foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, an Anglican of British origins, arrived at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 in order to secure most of the London pacts. Considerable results were achieved with the treaties and agreements signed in 1919 and 1920. Most importantly, Trent-South Tyrol and the Austrian Littoral (Trieste, Gorizia and Gradisca, and Istria) became part of the Italian regions of Trentino-Alto Adige and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The colonial compensations obtained by Italy were: the recognition and enlargement of the Italian Islands of the Aegean; the enlargement of the Italian possessions in Libya and in the Horn of Africa; and the establishment of an Italian sphere of influence over the Ottoman area of Antalya, later abandoned with the independence of Turkey. Italy also received the province of Zadar with some islands in Dalmatia and set up an Italian protectorate over Albania with the occupation of Vlora, which lasted until 1920 when domestic opposition within the Italian Armed Forces and the Vlora war led Italy to voluntarily abandon Albania; with the treaty of Tirana, Italy retained the island of Saseno and recognition of Albania as being within its sphere of influence (which was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1921). Finally, the disintegration of its two main rival powers (Austria-Hungary in Europe and the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean) and the entrance in the League of Nations' security council as a permanent member, cemented Italy's status as a great power.  \nChanges to the Italian eastern border from 1920 to 1975.  \nTherefore, most of the criticism directed against the Allies and the government focused on Dalmatia and the city of Fiume (which was later occupied by a contingent led by Gabriele D'Annunzio). A more substantial transfer of Dalmatian territories to Italy (favored by Sonnino) was complicated to achieve because of its Slavic population, whereas Fiume was ethnically an Italian city (and as such proposed by Orlando as an alternative), but not included in the Pact of London. Wilson vetoed these proposals on the ground that already many Germanophones and Slavs were to be placed under Italian administration. This led Orlando and Sonnino to temporarily abandon the conference in protest. Orlando had refused to see the outcome of the war as a mutilated victory and once replied to calls for greater expansion that \"Italy today is a great state... on par with the great historic and contemporary states. This is, for me, our main and principal expansion.\" But the disgruntled climate ultimately forced Orlando to resign, and the treaties he had negotiated were signed by his successors Francesco Saverio Nitti and Giovanni Giolitti.  \nFrom a contemporary historical point of view, it has sometimes been observed how much of Benito Mussolini's foreign policy was presented as an attempt to amend the injustices lamented as stemming from the mutilated victory: Fiume was taken in 1924, Albania was turned into a client state under Zog I and merged into the Kingdom in 1939, and Dalmatia was annexed during the occupation of Yugoslavia\u2014events that have been sporadically accused of prolonging Italy's participation in World War II. Some historians have at times seen the actions carried by the Fascist government on the subject as part of a larger imperialist project that brought Italy to descend into foreign affairs, by intervening in Spain, conquering Ethiopia, and occupying southern France and Tunisia. For historian Gaetano Salvemini \u201cFascism originated, grew, triumphed, and ultimately died, on the myth of mutilated victory\u201d. Conversely, attempts to include in the Italian nation state the detached lands populated by Italophones have also been lauded and supported, with subjects failing to recognize said urgency being decried by poet Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio as \u201cinsane and vile\u201d.  \nNotwithstanding the political characterizations of the Interwar period, the final settlement of peace after the end of World War II, which had deprived Italy of all of the lands to the east of the Adriatic Sea (except for the city of Trieste), proved to be unpopular among the Italian opinion and object of harsh criticism, being described by President Luigi Einaudi as leading to a condition of \u201cpainfully mutilated\u201d national unity.\n\n## Italy and the Triple Alliance  \nAngered by the French seizure of Tunisia, in which Italy had extensive economic interests and had viewed as a possible area for colonial annexation, in 1882, Italy joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria as a means of defending against further French aggression and gaining diplomatic backing for coming disputes. The alliance, however, proved troublesome. Italy and Austria-Hungary had been rivals for many years; the latter had, for years, held northeastern Italy, opposed Italian unification, and it still held Trieste and Istria, Zara and the coast of Dalmatia, the primary targets of the Italian irredentist movement.  \nAs such, in the years before 1914, Italy engaged in diplomatic maneuvers to ally itself with the United Kingdom and France. In 1902, Italy concluded a secret treaty with Britain in which Italy abandoned the Triple Alliance, with the stipulation that it be given the territories currently controlled by Austria.  \n## Treaty of London (1915)  \nAfter World War I erupted, the pressure by both sides for Italy to enter the war increased. On April 26, 1915, the Triple Entente and Italy signed a secret agreement, called the Treaty of London, that stipulated the terms of Italy\u2019s participation in World War I against the Germany-Austrian Alliance. If Italy declared war on Germany and the Entente emerged victorious, Italy would be awarded territories of the House of Habsburg in the Southern Alps and in the Balkans, specifically the regions of Trentino and the South Tyrol (up to the northern limit of the Brenner Pass), the Friuli-Julian area, Trieste and the surrounding area, Istria, and the North of the Dalmatian Cost including the city of \u0160ibenik. Other possible territories included in the treaty were the city of Vlor\u00eb in Albania, some part on the south Anatolian coast, as well as a share of the German colonial empire.  \n<ImageHere>Map of Dalmatia and Venezia Giulia with the boundaries set by the Treaty of London (1915) (red line) and those actually obtained from Italy (green line). The black line marks the border of the Governorate of Dalmatia (1941\u20131943). The ancient domains of the Republic of Venice are indicated in fuchsia (dashed diagonally, the territories that belonged occasionally)\nThese demands were outlined by the Italian Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino to secure a strong Italian presence in the Mediterranean. The acquisition of the area surrounding the Adriatic, especially the port city of Trieste, would strengthen Italian naval presence and keep pace with possible postwar territorial gains in the area by the other members of the Entente. The demands for lands carved from the Ottoman Empire and the African colonies were motivated by national ambition.  \nSonnino however delayed a declaration of war against Germany even though Italy had declared war on Austria-Hungary. By May 1915, the Italian push towards Ljubljana reached a stalemate with Austrian forces in the Alps while Britain, France and Germany were embroiled in a stalemate of their own on the Western Front. The outcome of the war was not yet clear, and Sonnino stood by a position of neutrality with Germany. That would soften as Sonnino realized Italy\u2019s army was in no position to carry out a protracted war, and pressure from within Italy demanded solidarity with the Entente. The Italian government declared war on Germany on 28 August 1916.\n\n### Wilson's opposition  \nIn January 1917, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote a letter to American President Woodrow Wilson expressing his disapproval of the promise to give Italy the Adriatic territories. In a later trip to the United States in May to speak with American diplomat Edward M. House about the pact, Balfour made it clear that Britain had no particular ill will against Austria-Hungary and that the planned transfer of the Slavic lands to Italy would only create more problems. While American-Italian diplomatic dialogue regarding the claims did not take place prior to the Peace Conference, Wilson\u2019s own stance on the matter was clear in his Fourteen Points, which urged for the Italian border with Austria to be redrawn along \"clearly recognizable lines of nationality\". His first point urged for no international agreements to be negotiated in secret so he refused to recognise the arrangements made under the pact. Sonnino's plans for securing the Adriatic were ignored, as were the imperial aims of Italy, and concessions were made in the form of postwar American economic aid.  \n## Aftermath  \nThe cause of mutilated victory was embraced by many Italians, particularly in the irredentist, monarchical, militaristic factions. The poet Gabriele D'Annunzio criticized in print and in speeches the failures of Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando at the proceedings in Versailles, particularly in his attempts to acquire the city of Fiume (Croatian: Rijeka), which, notwithstanding the fact that its inhabitants were more than 90% ethnic Italians, was supposed to be ceded by Austria to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. On September 12, 1919, D\u2019Annunzio took matters into his own hands and led a militia of 2,600 men against a mixed force of Allied soldiers to occupy the city. In Fiume, the victors established the Italian Regency of Carnaro, an unrecognized state based on the Charter of Carnaro.  \nWhile the regime would be short-lived, its effect on the people and politics of the Kingdom of Italy would leave their mark on the following decades of Italian history. Benito Mussolini was resolute to endorse the safeguard of national unity during the period of the creation of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento, the precursor of the National Fascist Party. Mussolini, an interventionist in World War I, attributed Italy\u2019s great price of over 1.2 million casualties and 148 billion lire of expenditure to the weakness of the national government and to the disloyal attitude of the country\u2019s former allies.\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided and the historical maps, which statement accurately describes Italy's territorial gains after World War I?\nChoice list: \nA.

Although she is not identified as transgender in the film, viewers and critics who supported this interpretation additionally pointed to the use of the flag's colors (light pink, light blue, and white) elsewhere in scenes involving Gwen and her universe, and the perceived parallels to coming out in her character arc within the film. However, others have noted that the blue and white colors were already used by the comics' version of Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy, and thus were not necessarily proof that the film version of the character is trans. The use of the transgender flag was reported to have led to the film being withdrawn from release in the United Arab Emirates and other MENA countries.\n\n### TikTok trend  \nAn Internet meme involving the \"canon event\" began spreading on TikTok after the film's release, which later became a trend. According to TheBeauLife, it was inspired by the core memories meme in Inside Out (2015). The meme's word \"canon\" elaborated its special defintion as \"ironic (if not actually painful)\" experiences in real-life.  \n### Accolades  \n## Future  \n### Sequel  \nA third film was confirmed when Lord and Miller revealed in December 2021 that Across the Spider-Verse was being split into two films. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part Two) was expected at that point to be released in 2023. In April 2022, it was retitled Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. In response to a claim by an artist on Across, who spoke to Vulture on condition of anonymity, that it would not be possible to release Beyond as scheduled (which at that point had been on March 29, 2024) due to an alleged lack of production progress, Lord and Miller stated that the production would \"take the time necessary\" for the film to be completed to their standards. In July 2023, the film was removed from the release schedule, reportedly due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, as a source within Sony\u2014a member of the AMPTP against whom SAG-AFTRA is negotiating\u2014told Variety that the strike precluded the film's voice cast from recording their lines on schedule.  \n### Spin-off  \nSony began developing a Spider-Women film in November 2018 that would focus on three generations of female, Spider-related characters. Bek Smith was writing the spin-off, and Lauren Montgomery was in talks to direct. Pascal said the film would focus on the characters Gwen Stacy / Spider-Gwen, Cindy Moon / Silk, and Jess Drew / Spider-Woman, and said Across the Spider-Verse would serve as a \"launching pad\" for it. In May 2023, producer Avi Arad stated that the film would be titled Spider-Woman.  \n### Manga spin-off  \nOn May 29, 2023, it was announced that a manga spin-off titled Spider-Man: Octopus Girl written by Hideyuki Furuhashi and illustrated by Betten Court would begin serialization on June 20 on Shueisha's Sh\u014dnen Jump+ website and app. The story revolves around Doctor Octopus, who falls into a coma and has been reawakened in the body of young Japanese middle schooler named Otoha Okutamiya.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the development of the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sequel is true?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\n<ImageHere>Montefiore synagogue and tomb of Montefiore in Ramsgate, England\nAfter retiring from business, Montefiore devoted the rest of his life to philanthropy. He was president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews from 1835 to 1874, a period of 39 years, the longest tenure ever, and member of Bevis Marks Synagogue. As president, he corresponded with the British consul in Damascus, Charles Henry Churchill, in 1841\u201342; a practice seen as pivotal to the development of Proto-Zionism.  \nFrom retirement until the day he died, Montefiore devoted himself to philanthropy, particularly alleviating the distress of Jews abroad. He went to the sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1840 to liberate from prison ten Syrian Jews of Damascus arrested for blood libel in a case known as the Damascus affair; to Rome in 1858 to try to free Jewish youth Edgardo Mortara, who had been seized by the Catholic Church after allegedly being baptised by a Catholic servant; to Russia in 1846 (where he was received by the Tsar) and 1872; to Morocco in 1864, and to Romania in 1867. These missions made him a folk hero of near mythological proportions among the oppressed Jews of Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Levant.  \nMontefiore received a baronetcy in 1846 in recognition of his services to humanitarian causes on behalf of the Jewish people.\n\n## Philanthropy in Ottoman Palestine  \nMontefiore on his 100th birthday  \nHe and his wife travelled to Palestine after the region was wracked by an earthquake in 1836. The towns of Safed and Tiberias were particularly damaged, with the few survivors suffering disorder, terror and disease. Moses and Judith launched an ambitious programme of relief in 1837.  \nIn 1854 his American friend Judah Touro, also a Sephardic Jew, died after having bequeathed money to fund Jewish residential settlement in Palestine. Montefiore was appointed executor of his will, and used the funds for a variety of projects to encourage the Jews to engage in productive labor. In 1855, he purchased an orchard on the outskirts of Jaffa that offered agricultural training to the Jews.  \nIn 1860, he built the first Jewish residential settlement and almshouse outside the old walled city of Jerusalem, which today is known as Mishkenot Sha'ananim. This became the first precursor of the New Yishuv. Living outside the city walls was dangerous at the time, due to lawlessness and bandits. Montefiore offered financial inducement to encourage poor families to move there. Montefiore intended Mishkenot Sha\u2019ananim to be a new type of self-sufficient, sanitary settlement where Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews lived together. Later on, Montefiore established adjacent neighborhoods south of Jaffa Road, the Ohel Moshe neighborhood for Sephardic Jews and the Mazkeret Moshe neighborhood for Ashkenazi Jews, who had distinctly different traditions and languages.  \n<ImageHere>Montefiore Windmill in Mishkenot Sha'ananim\nMontefiore donated large sums of money to promote industry, education, and health amongst the Jewish community in Palestine. The project, bearing the hallmarks of nineteenth-century artisanal revival, aimed to promote productive enterprise in the Yishuv. The builders were brought over from England. These activities were part of a broader program to enable the Old Yishuv to become self-supporting in anticipation of the establishment of a Jewish homeland.  \nMontefiore built the Montefiore Windmill in an area that later developed as the Yemin Moshe neighbourhood, to provide cheap flour to poor Jews. He also established a printing press and textile factory, and helped to finance several Bilu agricultural colonies. The Jews of Old Yishuv referred to their patron as \"ha-Sar Montefiore\" ('The Prince' or simply 'Prince' Montefiore), a title perpetuated in Hebrew literature and song.  \nMontefiore commissioned several censuses of the Yishuv, or Jewish community in Palestine: these were conducted in 1839, 1849, 1855, 1866 and 1875, and provided much data about the people. The censuses attempted to list every Jew individually, together with some biographical and social information (such as their family structure, place of origin, and degree of poverty).\n\n## Later life and death  \nSeal of the \"Kerem Moshe Montefiore and Yehudit\" Society in Jerusalem (\"Vineyard of Moses and Judith Montefiore\" Society in Jerusalem); inscribed in Hebrew and German  \nMontefiore played an important role in Ramsgate affairs, and one of the local ridings still bears his name. In 1845 he served as High Sheriff of Kent. In 1873, the year of his 89th birthday, a local newspaper mistakenly ran his obituary. \"Thank God to have been able to hear of the rumour\", he wrote to the editor, \"and to read an account of the same with my own eyes, without using spectacles.\"  \nThe town celebrated his 99th and his 100th birthdays in great style, and every local charity (and church) benefited from his philanthropy. At East Cliff Lodge, he established a Sephardic yeshiva (Judith Lady Montefiore College) after the death of his wife in 1862. In the grounds he built the elegant, Regency architecture Montefiore Synagogue and mausoleum modeled on Rachel's Tomb outside Bethlehem. (He also paid for the refurbishment and upkeep of this historic tomb.) Judith was laid to rest there in 1862.  \nMontefiore died in 1885, at age 100 years and 9 months. He had no known children. His principal heir in name, arms and property was his nephew Sir Joseph Sebag-Montefiore (1822-1903, born Joseph Sebag), a British banker, stockbroker and politician.  \nSir Joseph's descendant, British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore (born 1965), revealed that his family believes Sir Moses to have fathered a child late in life with a 16-year-old domestic servant. Philanthropist Leonard Montefiore was a great-nephew of Sir Moses Montefiore. Sir Moses Montefiore was buried in the Montefiore Synagogue at Ramsgate.  \nThe estate was sold to the Borough of Ramsgate around 1952, and the Lodge was demolished in 1954. All that remains today is a new building housing a firm of architects. It incorporates parts of the original structure, called the Coach House. There are also some outbuildings that survive (including the Gate House). The Italianate Greenhouse has been restored to its former glory in the early 21st century. The Greenhouse and the rest of the estate are now protected as King George VI Memorial Park. A plaque on the Gate House honors Sir Moses.  \n## Legacy  \nOld Israeli Shekel, 1978  \nThe Montefiore Home for Chronic Invalids in Manhattan and the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, US are both named after him. Montefiore Square, a small, triangular park in upper Manhattan's Hamilton Heights neighbourhood, is named after Montefiore Medical Center.  \nA branch of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US also bears his name. Chicago's West Side is home to a reform school of higher education, Moses Montefiore Academy, named in honour of him.  \nA number of synagogues were named in honour of Montefiore, including the 1913 Montefiore Institute, now preserved as the Little Synagogue on the Prairie.  \nThe Montefiore Club was a private social and business association, catering to the Jewish community located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  \nIn Cleveland, Ohio, US, a Jewish nursing homes is called Montefiore.  \nHe was commemorated on two Israeli banknotes. These were the IL10, which was in circulation from 1970\u201379, and the IS\u00a01, which was legal tender from 1980 to 1986.  \nThe Dolphin's Barn Jewish cemetery in Dublin, Ireland, is dedicated to Montefiore.  \n## Anecdote  \nMontefiore was renowned for his quick and sharp wit. A popularly circulated anecdote, possibly apocryphal, relates that at a dinner party he was once seated next to a nobleman who was known to be an anti-Semite. The nobleman told Montefiore that he had just returned from a trip to Japan, where \"they have neither pigs nor Jews.\" Montefiore is reported to have responded immediately, \"in that case, you and I should go there, so it will have a sample of each\" (a similar anecdote is told of Israel Zangwill.)  \n## Coat of arms\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the contributions of the person associated with the structures shown in these images?\nChoice list: \nA.

Initially, the militia units were centered on the 35 counties that then existed in the Province of North Carolina.  The units fought against the British, Loyalists, and Cherokee Native Americans that aligned themselves with British forces.  The units included military district brigades established in 1776, county regiments, four battalions, and one independent corps of light horse. Four regiments were located in counties that became part of the Southwest Territory in 1790 and later Tennessee in 1796. The size of brigades could be up to a few thousand volunteers. Brigades were commanded by a brigadier general.   Regiments were commanded by a colonel and made up of a number of companies commanded by captains with about 50 men in each company.  During engagements, one or more companies of regiments may have been involved in actions and commanded by the regimental or brigade commander.  In 1778, Major General John Ashe was selected to command all North Carolina militia and State Troops.  Brigade commanders reported to him.  Separate from the North Carolina militia, the state provided 10 numbered regiments to the Continental Army that were referred to as the North Carolina Line.\n\n## Background  \nIn August 1775, the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress of North Carolina delegates appointed Cornelius Harnett the head of the Council of Safety which oversaw resistance to British rule. They also divided the colony into six military districts for the purpose of organizing militia and arranging representation in the executive body of the Council of Safety. At the county level, there were Committees of Safety, including the Rowan, Anson, Mecklenburg, Surry, and Tryon counties.  Many members of these committees of safety became the officers of the regiments of militia.  \nThe North Carolina Provincial Congress authorized 35 existing county militias to be organized on September 9, 1775.  Some counties had already established their militias earlier than 1775.  The Rowan County regiment was split on October 22, 1775 into two distinct regiment, the 1st Rowan County Regiment and the 2nd Rowan County Regiment.  On December 22 that same year, the North Carolina Provincial Council split the Pasquotank County Regiment into two separate and distinct regiments, the 1st and 2nd Pasquotank County regiments.  The two additional regiments brought the total number of county regiments to 37 by the end of 1775.  \n## Units  \nThe following are the North Carolina militia brigades and regiments with their subordination, along with the dates established and disestablished, as well as the original commander when the unit was established by the Provincial Congress.  Many counties started mustering and training militia before the Provincial Congress got around to it, as early as October 1774 (Johnson County Regiment). Regiments were subordinated to named brigades after brigades were established in 1776.  Brigades were headed by a brigadier general and subordinate to the state militia headed by a major general officer, who reported to the Governor of North Carolina.  As new counties were created by the legislature, new regiments were created and some were disbanded.   At the time of the Battle of Kings Mountain in October 1780, there were 50 counties and 51 regiments of militia.  Many regiments had two colonels.  Soldiers and officers from these units were engaged in battles and skirmishes, primarily in North Carolina and South Carolina, but a few engagements were in Georgia, Virginia, and East Florida.  As militia units, the soldiers did not serve full-time and returned home between engagements, musters, and drills.\n\nQuestion: Which individual served as the commander of the New Bern District Brigade, as well as the 2nd and 4th North Carolina Militia during the American Revolution?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# The Indian Bean Tree, St James Square, Monmouth  \nSt James Square in Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales is the site of a historic Indian Bean Tree.  \nThe Catalpa bignonioides, a native of the southeastern United States, was planted in the square in about 1900. It was joined by the Monmouth War Memorial in 1921. After more than one hundred years of presiding over the square, the tree became the focus of controversy when it was condemned by the Monmouthshire County Council in 2005. The decision was met with fierce community opposition. The parties involved resolved their differences in 2006, and the tree received treatment, albeit some of it unauthorized. By 2011, the Indian Bean Tree in St James Square was flourishing.  \n## Twentieth-century history  \n\"There are some lovely spots in the town centre, none prettier than St James's Square, with its old war memorial in the shadow of a romantic-looking tree.\" The tree mentioned in The Telegraph of 25 February 2006 was a reference to the Indian Bean Tree (pictured) that was planted in St James Square in Monmouth about 1900. Properly known as Catalpa bignonioides, it is a native of the southeastern United States. At the time of the unveiling of the Monmouth War Memorial (pictured) in 1921, the Catalpa was already a mature tree. In 1946, a rod was installed to support the main limbs of the tree. The Indian Bean Tree is considered by the Monmouth Action Group to be \"one of the best examples of the species in Britain.\" It is thought to be one of the oldest and largest specimens in the United Kingdom. The Indian Bean Tree is positioned behind the war memorial and surrounded by lawn, with an adjacent formal planting of flowers. The cenotaph, tree, lawn, and garden are enclosed by railings.  \n## Controversy  \n<ImageHere>Metal supports were placed under some large branches of the Indian Bean Tree c. 2006.\nThe Indian Bean Tree's poor health was brought to the attention of the Monmouthshire County Council in summer 2005 by one of the judges of the Wales in Bloom competition. The tree was subsequently condemned by the council. A spokesperson for the council indicated that the reason for taking down the tree was to avoid the possibility of litigation. The council was concerned that portions of the tree could fall and result in damage to people or property. In response, the Monmouth Town Council, Monmouth Archaeological Society, and Monmouth Action Group collaborated and hired an arboriculturalist, Roy Finch, to investigate the condition of the Catalpa. The tree surgeon indicated that the Catalpa was \u201can outstanding part of our tree heritage and worthy of the effort and expense involved in its management.\u201d He recommended treatment of the Indian Bean Tree to reduce the associated risks and to extend the life of the tree.  \nThe county council requested a second analysis by a different professional, Steve Ambler. That report, before November 2005, also concluded that the Catalpa could be made safe; however, the second evaluation suggested that the tree would probably die within a few years, even if treatment was undertaken. A revised report from Roy Finch of Malvern failed to dissuade the county council from their plan to condemn the Catalpa. Rather, it was reported in November 2005 that the council had solicited bids to fell the tree in St James Square in the face of intense opposition from the community. The Monmouthshire County Council continued to state that the tree was dangerous, in part due to its proximity to a school. The decision of the council was that the tree should be felled, and replaced with a new Catalpa.  \nArchaeologist Stephen Clarke, chairman of the Monmouth Action Group, suggested that there was a conflict of interest with regard to the actions of the Monmouthshire County Council. He indicated that council members were \"the guardians of the conservation area and so they just give themselves permission. The locals can do very little about it.\" Clarke recommended that residents continue to fight to maintain their local heritage. However, as an example of the difficulties inherent in saving Monmouth's heritage, the archaeologist mentioned that the town formerly had \"one of the most beautiful urban parks in the country, Drybridge Park, where every tree that would grow in Britain used to be planted but they've nearly all been chopped down.\" Clarke stated that, in a survey conducted by  British Archaeology, \"Monmouth was once classified as one of Britain's top 10 historical towns.\" The BBC News reported on 30 December 2011 that Monmouth had at one point been rated by the Council for British Archaeology as the seventh best town (for archaeological purposes) in Britain.\n\n## Progress to resolution  \n<ImageHere>Indian Bean Tree with supporting rods, behind Monmouth War Memorial, Nov 2007\nOn 9 January 2006, Stephen Clarke made a presentation to the Monmouth Town Council. He submitted a new evaluation of the Catalpa by Jerry Ross, a third expert. Ross was of the opinion that, while the tree was in poor health, it was \"far from dying.\" Clarke reminded council members that this was the third expert that had been hired, the first commissioned by the groups that he represented, Roy Finch, and the second commissioned by Monmouthshire County Council, Steve Ambler. Clarke indicated to the town council that members of the county council had dismissed the most recent evaluation performed by the third professional. The archaeologist also advised the town council that he and the chief executive of the county council were at odds with regard to the terminology used to describe the health of the tree, as well as the quantity of correspondence that had been received in support of the Catalpa. Clarke suggested that another evaluation be commissioned. As the county council was still intent on felling the Indian Bean Tree, Clarke had asked lawyers to seek a judicial review. Fundraising efforts included the sale of images of the Catalpa.  \nIn February 2006, it was reported that the Monmouth Archaeology Group and Monmouth Action Group had arranged for another (fourth) expert to investigate the health of the Indian Bean Tree. Arborist David Lonsdale advised that any risk posed by the Catalpa could be diminished with a two-fold approach: cutting back the top of the tree and supporting the main branches. The results of the investigation were communicated to the Monmouthshire County Council. The Indian Bean Tree at St James Square was of particular interest due to both its size and its status as one of the oldest specimens of Catalpa in the United Kingdom. The opinion of the arborist was that the value of the Catalpa merited the expense of inspection and arbor care. In addition, it was proposed that financing of the arbor work could be accomplished by utilizing the funds that had initially been targeted for felling the old tree and planting a new specimen. Lonsdale cautioned that the health of the tree would eventually deteriorate, despite treatment.\n\n## Outcome  \nThe fourth expert's evaluation of the Catalpa's condition met with a positive reception at the Monmouthshire County Council. The council worked with the Monmouth Town Council and Monmouth Action Group, and looked into performing the remedial arbor care. Treatment was undertaken, including crown reduction and general pruning that were completed by April 2006. In addition, temporary cable props had been placed by that month to support and strengthen the tree. Estimates for supporting rods were obtained: \u00a31500 for stainless steel and \u00a33000 for oak. Outside funding was sought to defray the expense of the tree props. Later, metal supports (pictured) were installed under some large branches of the Indian Bean Tree.  \nHowever, it was suspected that the late John \"Mad Jack\" Roocroft (September 1930 \u2013 January 2011), an eccentric Troy Way, Monmouth resident known for his flouting of authority, was responsible for the sudden absence of a large branch of the Indian Bean Tree which had overhung the street at St James Square. Although there was no proof, it was generally believed that it was the former millionaire's distinctive red tractor and trailer, laden with segments of the large limb, that had been spied headed away from the square early one day. His removal of the massive branch is felt to be partially responsible for the recovery of the Catalpa (link to 2011 photograph of Catalpa in bloom below). Roocroft, the son of a Lancashire farmer, had previously used his chain saw on trees in the Nelson Garden. In 2004, he applied his saw to five conifers in the garden, his reasoning being that they were not original to the Nelson Garden's 1802 design. In his February 2011 tribute to Roocroft, Stephen Clarke wrote, \"Good night Jack, I dare say that there will be flowers for you to plant in Heaven, beans for you to grow and Catalpa Trees for you to prune, and of course, authority for you to annoy.\"\n\nQuestion: What action was taken to help preserve the Indian Bean Tree in Monmouth, as depicted in the images?\nChoice list: \nA. The tree was relocated to a different area to ensure its survival.\nB. Metal supports were placed under some large branches to provide structural support.\nC.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# 2012 Toyota/Save Mart 350  \nThe 2012 Toyota/Save Mart 350 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race held on June 24, 2012, at Sonoma Raceway in Sonoma, California. Contested over 110\u00a0laps, it was the sixteenth race of the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season and the first of two road course competitions on the schedule. Clint Bowyer of Michael Waltrip Racing took his first win of the season, while Tony Stewart finished second and Kurt Busch finished third.  \n## Report  \n### Background  \nSonoma Raceway is one of two road courses to hold NASCAR races, the other being Watkins Glen International. The standard road course at Infineon Raceway is a 12-turn course that is km long; the track was modified in 1998, adding the Chute, which bypassed turns 5 and 6, shortening the course to km. The Chute was only used for NASCAR events such as this race, and was criticized by many drivers, who preferred the full layout. In 2001, it was replaced with a 70-degree turn, 4A, bringing the track to its current dimensions of km.  \nBefore the race, Matt Kenseth led the Drivers' Championship with 565 points, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. stood in second with 561. Greg Biffle was third in the Drivers' Championship with 548, sixteen points ahead of Jimmie Johnson and thirty-four ahead of Denny Hamlin in fourth and fifth. Kevin Harvick, with 504, was seven points ahead of Martin Truex Jr., as Tony Stewart with 491 points, was ten ahead of Clint Bowyer and thirty-three in front of Brad Keselowski. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 105 points, eighteen points ahead of Toyota. Ford, with 77 points, was twenty-eight points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third. Kurt Busch was the defending race winner.  \nFive teams chose to temporarily replace their regular drivers with road course ringers. One of which was Tommy Baldwin Racing, who replaced regular David Reutimann with Tomy Drissi, while another was FAS Lane Racing who chose Boris Said to replace regular drivers, Reed Sorenson and Ken Schrader. Humphrey Smith Racing also changed drivers, with Mike Bliss, racing at Road America in the Nationwide Series on the weekend, being replaced with Chris Cook, while Phil Parsons Racing replaced Michael McDowell with David Mayhew and Inception Motorsports co-owner David Stremme stepped aside in favor of Brian Simo. Robby Gordon also qualified for his first race since Auto Club Speedway.  \n### Practice and qualifying  \n<ImageHere>Marcos Ambrose, from Richard Petty Motorsports, won the pole position\nThree practice sessions were scheduled to be held before the Sunday race\u2014one on June 22, 2012, and two on June 23, 2012. The first session lasted 90 minutes. The second session was 45 minutes, while the final session finished after 75 minutes.  Jeff Gordon was quickest with a time of 75.653 seconds in the first session, less than two-tenths of a second faster than Truex Jr. Bowyer was just off Truex Jr.'s pace, followed by Joey Logano, Kyle Busch, and Ryan Newman. Marcos Ambrose was seventh, still within a second of Gordon's time.  \nForty-four cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three could qualify for the race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Ambrose clinched the second pole position of his career, with a record setting time of 75.203 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Gordon. Johnson qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Truex Jr. started fifth. Bowyer, Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, Kenseth and Newman rounded out the top ten. The driver that failed to qualify for the race was Brian Simo. Following the qualifying session, Ambrose stated, \"I beat myself up here in 2010.It was nothing to do with the car or the track. It was me. I know what not to do on the last restart.\" Afterward, third-placed Johnson commented, \"It was on edge the whole lap. I don't want to drive 110 laps the way it drove today.\"  \nIn the second practice session, Gordon remained quickest with a time of 75.961 seconds. Ambrose, with a time of 76.718, was second quickest, ahead of Allmendinger, Juan Pablo Montoya, and Keselowski. Kyle Busch, Johnson, Truex Jr., Bowyer, and McMurray completed the first ten positions. Gordon continued to be quickest through the third practice session with a time of 76.846, 0.885 slower than his fastest lap during the second session. Biffle was second quickest in the session, while Montoya was scored third. Johnson followed in the fourth position ahead of Allmendinger, Hamlin and Edwards. Truex Jr., Kahne and Kyle Busch rounded out the first ten positions in eighth, ninth and tenth, respectively.\n\n### Race  \nThe race, the fifteenth in the season, began at 3:21\u00a0p.m. EDT and was televised live in the United States on TNT. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race with the air temperature around \u00b0C. Track minister Tim Boeve began pre-race ceremonies, by giving the invocation. Next, University of California Straw Hat Band performed the national anthem, while Tony LaRussa and Toby Appleton, a Toyota Military Hero, gave the command for drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, David Gilliland had to start last on the grid after missing the mandatory drivers meeting. After leading 13 laps, Gordon would reach the 23,000 career laps led mark, the most of any current Sprint Cup Series driver .  \n## Results  \n### Qualifying  \nNotes  \n1\u00a0\u2014 David Gilliland started last on the grid because of missing the mandatory drivers meeting.  \n2\u00a0\u2014 Stephen Leicht also had to start in the rear of the grid after his team changed engines.  \n### Race results  \n<ImageHere>Clint Bowyer won the race.\n\n\n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nManufacturers' Championship standings  \n* Note: Only the top five positions are included for the driver standings.\n\nQuestion: Who won the pole position for the race described in the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Olivia Rodrigo, pictured in 2021, portrays Nini Salazar-Roberts throughout the series' first three seasons.\nTime reported in December 2021 that Rodrigo would return for the third season, amidst speculation that she would not due to the success of her solo music career. It was later stated that Rodrigo would return in a recurring role as opposed to the series regular status she maintained in the first two seasons; Federle confirmed that Rodrigo would exit the show after the third season. The casting for the third season was made public in January 2022; Bassett, Cornett, Wylie, Lester, Rene\u00e9, and Rodriguez were also confirmed to be returning. Saylor Bell Curda and Adrian Lyles joined the cast as new series regulars, playing Maddox and Jet respectively. Further additions to the guest cast included Jason Earles as Dewey Wood and Meg Donnelly as Val. Corbin Bleu, who starred in the original film series, was also announced as a guest, playing himself. Three further recurring characters were revealed in March: Ben Stillwell, Aria Brooks, and Liamani Segura as Channing, Alex and Emmy respectively. Saperstein, Reinders, Serafini, and Keegan were listed as guests for the third season in May 2022; it was stated that Mark St. Cyr would not return. Two additions to the guest cast were revealed the following month: JoJo Siwa as Madison and Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Marvin.  \nFederle stated in September 2022 that the fourth season would revolve around the characters Ricky, Gina, Ashlyn, Kourtney, and Carlos; it was later confirmed that Bassett, Wylie, Lester, Rene\u00e9, and Rodriguez would return. The casting announcement for the fourth season also revealed that Segura had been promoted to the main cast, and Reinders would return as a series regular. Federle confirmed that Rodrigo would not feature in the fourth season, but said that she could return to the series in the future. He said that he was in negotiations for original High School Musical cast members to star as guests in the season; it was announced that Bleu, Grabeel, and Stroh would return, joined by Monique Coleman, Bart Johnson and Alyson Reed, all playing themselves. Further additions to the recurring cast included Kylie Cantrall as Dani, Matthew Sato as Mack, Caitlin Reilly as Quinn, and Vashty Mompoint as Krystal.\n\n### Filming  \nProduction on the first season began on February 15, 2019, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Production on the second season commenced in February 2020, but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming had resumed by November 2020. Filming for the third season began in January 2022 and concluded in April 2022; production of the series relocated from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. Production returned to Salt Lake City for the filming of the fourth season, which ran from September to December 2022.  \nThe mockumentary style of the series is achieved through the single-camera setup, with handheld cameras used to create shaky footage and zooming. Talking heads are also used; the characters talk directly to the camera to express their inner thoughts. The scenes containing shaky footage and talking heads represent the \"present-day\" in the story; flashbacks to Nini and Ricky's past relationship are filmed more similarly to other teen drama series.  \n### Music  \nThe first season's soundtrack contains nine original songs, and one new composition featured in each episode. The majority of songs are performed live by the actors. Some actors played instruments such as a guitar in their performances. Rodrigo wrote an original song for the series, \"All I Want\", and co-wrote \"Just for a Moment\" with Bassett and music producer Dan Book. Federle stated that his original pitch included the idea of developing original songs for the series. Steve Vincent, who worked on the original films, served as the musical supervisor for the series and sourced several composers to write new music. He also received submissions from songwriters based in Los Angeles. The soundtrack for the first season, featuring new songs and renditions of songs from the original film, was released on January 10, 2020, by Walt Disney Records. In the lead-up to the release, selected tracks were made available weekly to correlate with the episodes being released.  \nAn album accompanying the holiday special, High School Musical: The Musical: The Holiday Special, was released on November 20, 2020, which includes Christmas music and selected songs as a preview of the second season. As well as both new songs and new versions of songs from the High School Musical franchise, the second season's soundtrack features songs from Beauty and the Beast, written by Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice. Bassett and Rodrigo both wrote original songs for the second season. The season's soundtrack was released on July 30, 2021, which includes a cover of \"Home\" by Keegan. The third season's soundtrack features music from the Disney Channel television film Camp Rock as well as the High School Musical franchise and songs from the featured production Frozen. The first song, a cover of \"It's On\" from Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, was released as a preview on July 7, 2022, before the season's release. Bassett co-wrote and co-produced an original song, \"Finally Free\", for the season. Rene\u00e9 also co-wrote a song for the season, titled \"Here I Come\", collaborating with songwriters Anthony M. Jones and Steph Jones. The song's lyrics were inspired by her experiences with anxiety. Music from High School Musical 3: Senior Year will feature in the fourth season, as well as original music. Federle stated that the season would see a return to songs being performed live by the actors within the episodes, which had not occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n## Release  \nThe first episode of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series was telecast on Disney Channel, ABC, and Freeform on November 8, 2019, ahead of its launch on the streaming service Disney+ on November 12, 2019, in 4K HDR. The preview simulcast of the first episode was viewed by 2.03million on ABC, in addition to 474,000 on Disney Channel and 293,000 during its Freeform airing. The broadcast received 2.8million viewers in total. On the streaming service, episodes were released weekly rather than the binge-watching model of all at once. The first-season finale was released on January 10, 2020. High School Musical: The Musical: The Holiday Special, featuring the cast performing Christmas music, was released December 11, 2020; the 45-minute special featured previews of songs and scenes from the second season. Before the release of the second season, Disney Channel aired the complete first season in a marathon format on May 8, 2021. The first season also airs on Disney Channel in Latin America. The second season premiered on May 14, 2021. The season was originally planned to debut in 2020 but was delayed after the COVID-19 pandemic halted filming. The third season premiered on July 27, 2022; episodes were released weekly. The fourth and final season premiered on August 9, 2023; all episodes were released at once.  \n## Reception  \n### Critical response  \nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 75% approval for the first season with an average rating of 7.38/10 based on 32 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though fans may find what they've been looking for in its nostalgic stylings, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series follows a little too closely in its predecessor's steps to truly be the start of something new.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" for the series as a whole.  \nCritics commented on the differences between the series and the film, and there was a mixed reaction to the mockumentary format. Vinnie Mancuso of Collider described the series as \"endearingly tongue-in-cheek\". Kelly Lawler indicated that the series is a \"love letter\" to high school theater productions in a review for USA Today. Joel Keller of Decider opined that viewing the series did not require an understanding of the original franchise; Caroline Framke of Variety considered some elements of the program too similar to the original film's \"two-dimensional\" approach. Insiders Libby Torres said the series lacked the \"infectious energy\" of the original film and found the premise jarring. Mancuso objected to the mockumentary style of the series, arguing that the format distracted from other humor in the episodes. /Films Ethan Anderton described the technique as \"inorganic and unnecessary\". Daniel Toy of Tom's Guide felt the talking heads helped avoid unfamiliarity with characters.  \nThe cast's music and dance performances have been commended by critics. Shannon Miller of The A.V. Club praised the cast's talent, in particular, Rodrigo and Bassett for their musical ability and \"handling of dramatic material\". Writing for Decider, Kayla Cobb stated that the two leads have significant romantic chemistry. Megan Peters of ComicBook.com praised Rodrigo for her portrayal of Nini's guarded personality, and Keller described her as \"especially magnetic\". Anderton also applauded the cast and suggested that the series does not feature the same \"exaggerated acting style\" as the source material. The show's choreography was commended, as well as Wylie for her dance capability. Toy noted Rodriguez's comedic timing in his portrayal of Carlos. Anderton, Peters, and Framke likened Kate Reinders's performance as the exuberant Miss Jenn to Kristin Chenoweth.  \nThe series has been likened to Glee for its themes, as well as its combination of music and drama. Framke described the series as a \"sweet and very silly version of Glee\", and Peters noted similarities through its \"quick cuts and quips\". Miller considered that High School Musical uses music more as a literal than the abstract element in the storyline. Reviewing the music, Mancuso and Toy expressed interest in the program continuing to provide new songs to complement the original film's soundtrack. Cobb commended the vocal abilities of the main cast and described Rodrigo as \"an especially pronounced talent\" with a sweet and sincere voice.  \n### Accolades\n\nQuestion: Which musical was NOT performed by the theater students of East High School as mentioned in the descriptions of the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Wildlife of Christmas Island  \n<ImageHere>Christmas goshawks\nThe wildlife of Christmas Island is composed of the flora and fauna of this isolated island in the tropical Indian Ocean. Christmas Island is the summit plateau of an underwater volcano. It is mostly clad in tropical rainforest and has karst, cliffs, wetlands, coasts and sea. It is a small island with a land area of abbr=on, 63% of which has been declared a National park. Most of the rainforest remains intact and supports a large range of endemic species of animals and plants.\n\n## Geography  \nTopography of Christmas Island  \nThe island is about mi long and abbr=on wide. The total land area is sqmi, with abbr=on of coastline. The island is the flat summit of an underwater volcano more than abbr=on high, with about abbr=on being submerged and only about abbr=on above the surface. Some basalt is exposed in places but most of the surface rock is limestone accumulated from coral growth. The karst terrain supports numerous anchialine pools. Steep cliffs along much of the coast rise abruptly to a central plateau. The island is mainly covered by tropical rainforest, much of which remains intact. Two thirds of the island is included in the Christmas Island National Park which includes rainforests, wetlands, cliffs, shore and coral reefs.  \nThe climate is tropical and temperatures vary little throughout the year. The highest temperature of around F usually occurs  in March and April, while the lowest temperature is around F in August. There is a dry season from July to October with only occasional showers. The wet season is between November and June, and includes monsoons and occasional tropical cyclones.  \n## Flora  \n<ImageHere>Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer)\nAbout 213 species of vascular plant are native to the island, with sixteen of them endemic. The rainforest on the upper slopes and central plateau consists of large evergreen trees with a canopy at abbr=on and a scattering of emergent trees some abbr=on high. The dominant trees are Planchonella duclitan, Syzygium nervosum, Tristiropsis acutangula, Inocarpus fagifer and Hernandia ovigera. Mid-storey species include two endemic trees, the Christmas Island palm, Arenga listeri and the screw pine Pandanus elatus. There are few shrubs, but the trunks and branches of the trees are swathed in a tangle of vines, orchids and ferns.  \nOn terraces lower down the cliffs the trees are shorter, reaching abbr=on. Here the dominant species are Pisonia grandis, Gyrocarpus americanus, Gyrocarpus americanus, Terminalia catappa and Erythrina variegata. Various shrubs grow at the foot of the cliffs and on the coastal flats, sometimes in dense thickets. These include the endemic Pandanus christmatensis and Abutilon listeri, as well as certain shrubs and trees whose buoyant seeds are dispersed across the sea such as Scaevola taccada, Cordia subcordata, Morinda citrifolia, Hibiscus tiliaceus and Guettarda speciosa.\n\n## Fauna  \nChristmas Island was uninhabited until the end of the nineteenth century. The island possesses no large native, terrestrial mammals and the endemic mammal fauna of the island has been largely destroyed by the introduction of exotic species such as cats, dogs and black rats (Rattus rattus). The diurnal bulldog rat (Rattus nativitatis) and the nocturnal Maclear's rat (Rattus macleari) both became extinct after the accidental introduction of the black rat. The Christmas Island shrew (Crocidura trichura) may also be extinct, and the Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi) has not been seen since 2009. The Christmas Island flying fox (Pteropus melanotus natalis), the only other endemic mammal, is declining in numbers and is considered threatened.  \nChristmas Island red crab  \nRather than mammals, it is crabs that dominate the fauna. There are at least 50 species on the island, some of them endemic, 30 of them terrestrial species whose only link with the ocean is the necessity to travel to the sea to breed. Several are small and inconspicuous, but others such as the coconut crab and Christmas Island red crab are large and present in enormous numbers. In the late twentieth century there were estimated to be about 120 million red crabs on the island, and the mass migration made by the mature individuals to the coast was spectacular. The red crabs are a keystone species, feeding on the forest floor on leaves, fallen fruits, flowers, seedlings and carrion and maintaining a lawn-like turf. In the twenty-first century the number of red crabs has reduced considerably because of the accidental introduction of the yellow crazy ant to the island; this invasive species has formed supercolonies, killed crabs and had a profound impact on the biodiversity of the island.  \nThe karst limestone areas are riddled with caves and sink-holes, some of the underground water-filled cavities being saline. These underground habitats have been imperfectly sampled, but at least twelve endemic subterranean invertebrates are known including some such as ostracods, the cave shrimp Procaris noelensis and a blind cave scorpion Hormurus polisorum, that may be relicts from the Mesozoic fauna of the Tethys Ocean. The island is fringed by coral reefs and nearly seven hundred species of marine fish have been recorded in the surrounding waters as well as three species of marine turtle and about a dozen species of whales and dolphins.  \nChristmas Island is recognised by BirdLife International as being an Important Bird Area, mostly because of the breeding populations of seabirds. These include the red-footed booby, which nests in colonies in bushes and trees, the brown booby, which nests on cliffs, and the endemic Abbott's booby which nests on tall, emergent trees. Another endemic bird, the Christmas frigatebird, nests on the shore terraces, and the great frigatebird nests in semi-deciduous trees nearby. The brown noddy and two species of tropicbird also nest on the island. Land birds include four endemic species, the Christmas thrush, the Christmas imperial pigeon, the Christmas white-eye and the Christmas Island hawk-owl, and several endemic sub-species. Over a hundred migrants and vagrant species of bird have been recorded on the island.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA. Both images depict species that are endemic to Christmas Island.\nB. The first image shows a plant species, while the second shows a bird species.\nC.

The early transport across the Straits was by private boat. The first large commercial concerns were the railways whose ferries pioneered concepts in ice breaking and ship design. The state took over auto traffic after complaints that the railways service was too expensive and unreliable for motorists.  \n#### Early ferries  \n* Mary Queen  \n* Gazelle  \n* Lotus  \n#### Straits of Mackinac auto ferries  \nThe state provided auto ferry service between 1923 and 1957. The ferries carried almost 1 million cars a year in the mid-1950s before the bridge opened in 1957. At that time, there were five ferries running with a total capacity of 500 cars; the largest ferry could carry 150.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Mafia state  \nIn politics, a mafia state or pakhanate is a state system where the government is tied with organized crime to the degree when government officials, the police, and/or military became a part of the criminal enterprise. According to US diplomats, the expression \"mafia state\" was coined by Alexander Litvinenko.  \n## Particular applications of the concept  \n### Mafia in Italy and Yakuza in Japan  \ndate=January 2022<ImageHere>Giulio Andreotti, seven-time Prime Minister of Italy, was charged with having links to the Mafia.\nIn a critical review of Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm's essay in Foreign Affairs, Peter Andreas pointed to the long existence of Italian mafia and Japanese Yakuza, writing that there were close relationships between those illicit organisations and respective governments. According to Andreas, these examples speak against incidences of mafia states as a historically new threat.  \nIn Italy, three main mafia organisations originated in the 19th century: the Cosa Nostra originating from the region of Sicily, the Camorra originating from the region of Campania, and the 'Ndrangheta originating from the region of Calabria.  \nFormer Prime Minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti, had legal action against him, with a trial for mafia association on 27 March 1993 in the city of Palermo. The prosecution accused the former prime minister of \"making available to the mafia association named Cosa Nostra for the defense of its interests and attainment of its criminal goals, the influence and power coming from his position as the leader of a political faction\".  Prosecutors said in return for electoral support of Salvo Lima and assassination of Andreotti's enemies, he had agreed to protect the Mafia, which had expected him to fix the Maxi Trial. Andreotti's defense was predicated on character attacks against the prosecution's key witnesses, who were themselves involved with the mafia. Andreotti was acquitted on 23 October 1999. However, together with the greater series of corruption cases of Mani pulite, Andreotti's trials marked the purging and renewal of Italy's political system.  \nThe Camorra Casalesi clan rose in the 1980s, gaining control of large areas of the local economy \"partly by manipulating politicians and intimidating judges\". The clan was heavily involved in the Naples waste management crisis that dumped toxic waste around Campania in the 1990s and 2000s; the boss of the clan, Gaetano Vassallo, admitted to systematically working for 20 years to bribe local politicians and officials to gain their acquiescence to dumping toxic waste.\n\n### Countries described as mafia states  \n#### Republics, mobs and territories of the former Yugoslavia  \n<ImageHere>Montenegro's former president Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 is often described as having strong links to Montenegrin mafia.\nKosovo, a partially recognised independent state formerly part of Serbia, was called a \"mafia state\" by Italian MEP Pino Arlacchi in 2011, and also by Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm in his 2012 essay \"Mafia States\" in Foreign Affairs. Na\u00edm pointed out that Prime Minister of Kosovo Hashim Tha\u00e7i is allegedly connected to the heroin trade. Many other crime allegations have been made and investigated by several countries against Tha\u00e7i.  \nNa\u00edm also labeled Montenegro as a \"mafia state\" in the same essay, describing it as a hub for cigarette smuggling.\n\n#### Transnistria  \nTransnistria, an unrecognised break-away state from Moldova, has long been described by journalists, researchers, politicians and diplomats as a quasi-state whose economy is dependent on contraband and gunrunning, with some having directly referred to Transnistria as a mafia state.  \nFor instance, in 2002, Moldova's president, Vladimir Voronin, called Transnistria a \"residence of international mafia\", \"smuggling stronghold\", and \"outpost of Islamic combatants\". Attempts of customs blockade followed the allegations. Reacting to the allegations, Russian state-run RTR aired an investigative program revealing that Transnistrian firms were conducting industrial-level manufacturing of small arms purposely for subsequent illegal trafficking via the Ukrainian port of Odesa. According to the program, the trade was controlled by and benefited from Transnistria's founder and then-ruler Igor Smirnov.  \nHowever, more recent investigations and monitoring missions did not prove continuity in arms trafficking concerns. According to regular reports of the European Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM), there have been no signs of significant weapons smuggling from Transnistria. During the press conference on 30 November 2006, head of EUBAM Ferenc Banfi officially stated that organised smuggling of weapons in Transnistria did not exist. In 2013, Ukrainian Foreign Minister and acting chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Leonid Kozhara gave an interview to El Pa\u00eds, commenting on the situation in Transnistria and results of work of the EUBAM mission. According to Kozhara, there have been no cases of arms traffic found.  \nSome experts from Russia and Transnistria state that allegations of Transnistria being a \"mafia state\", \"black hole of Europe\", and \"heaven for arms trafficking\", etc. are a carefully planned defamation campaign paid by the Moldovan government and aimed at producing a negative image of Transnistria. Officials from the European Union and the OSCE say they have no evidence that the Tiraspol regime has ever trafficked arms or nuclear material. Much of the alarm is attributed to efforts by the Moldovan government to increase pressure on Transnistria.  \n#### Russia  \nThe term has been used by slain Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko and media to describe the political system in Russia under Vladimir Putin's rule. This characterization came to prominence following the United States diplomatic cables leak, which revealed that US diplomats viewed Russia as \"a corrupt, autocratic kleptocracy centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which officials, oligarchs and organised crime are bound together to create a 'virtual mafia state.'\" In his book titled Mafia State, journalist and author Luke Harding argues that Putin has \"created a state peopled by ex-KGB and FSB officers, like himself, who are bent on making money above all.\" In the estimation of American diplomats, \"the government of Russia effectively is the mafia.\" Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen has also described Russia as a \"mafia state\".  \nAccording to the New Statesman, \"the term had entered the lexicon of expert discussion\" several years before the cables leak, \"and not as a frivolous metaphor. Those most familiar with the country had come to see it as a kleptocracy with Vladimir Putin in the role of capo di tutti capi, dividing the spoils and preventing turf wars between rival clans of an essentially criminal elite.\" In 2008, Stephen Blank noted that Russia under Putin is \"a state that European officials privately call a Mafia state\" that \"naturally gravitates toward Mafia-like behavior.\"  \nNikolay Petrov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said \"it's pretty hard to damage the Russian image in the world because it's already not very good\".  \n#### Syria  \nFor more than half a century, Syria has been under the tight grip of the Assad dynasty, and its ruling system has been described as a mafia state. Due to the Syrian economy being dominated by business people tied to Assad family, control of various services like electricity by loyalist warlords, etc. more than 90% of Syrians live in poverty. The regime also profits from a multi-billion dollar captagon industry, made of a network consisting of over 35 manufacturing centres and factories, known as the \"Syndicate\" (Niqabeh). Assad's wife Asma stripped the assets of pro-Assad billionaire Rami Makhlouf and subsequently took control of all foreign charities and UN aid money; enabling the Assads to own revenue money directly. The fall of Rami Makhlouf led to widespread characterisations of Assad acting as a crime boss presiding over \"a crime syndicate simply designed to enrich himself and his family\", deploying violence to advance the interests of his mafia. Businessman Ribal al-Assad, a cousin of Bashar al-Assad who lives in exile outlines the situation: \"When it's all boiled down, the family is still in charge.. They are very sensitive to internal issues and they know how to manage them. They have a saying: \"You may not have to listen to your cousins, but you do need to listen to their mothers.\"  \nVarious academics compare Assad's reign to tribal rule, with Assad as the tribal chieftain glorified by the system and extolled as its saviour. Syrian-French Professor of Sociology Burhan Ghalioun asserts that Bashar al-Assad doesn't see Syrians as an independent people, but rather as guests in his family property. Hence, Assad's dictatorship is akin to the colonial project of an invading empire, according to Ghalioun. Syrian historian Rana Kabbani designates Assad's dynastic rule as \"internal colonialism\" owing to the deep disconnect of the regime's post-colonial ruling classes from its native population and their blatant disregard for Syrian wealth and lives. Describing how neo-Ba'athist ideologues and Assadist security apparatus constructed a totalitarian state built around cult of personality to the Assad dynasty, Rana Kabbani writes: \"When Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez, came to power through yet another violent army squabble leading to his coup of 1970, an alarming cult of the leader was systematically formed around him, modelled on Ceausescu. The Romanian dictator was Assad's political ally, strategic adviser in matters of popular repression, and close personal and family friend...In the government school I attended in Damascus between 1971 and 1974, a process of wholesale brainwashing had begun. It was designed to create a population with no political personality or affiliation \u2013 other than to the head of what would become, in my children's generation, a vindictive family mafia, monopolising business and power with the crudest of propaganda machines and the most lethal of security services.\"  \n#### Mexico  \nThe scholar of Law and Economics Edgardo Buscaglia describes the political system of Mexico as a \"Mafiacracy\". Buscaglia characterises the condition between the state, the economy and organized crime in Mexico as a mutual interweaving, Mexico has also been labeled as a Narco-state (a political and economic term applied to countries where all legitimate institutions become penetrated by the power and wealth of the illegal drug trade).  \n#### Other  \nVenezuela under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has also been evaluated as creating the conditions for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to consolidate a \"mafia state\", according to political scientists in Policy Studies in 2021. Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, Venezuelan writer and the author of Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats Are Hijacking the Global Economy, wrote in an article for the American magazine Foreign Policy: \"In mafia states such as Bulgaria, Guinea-Bissau, Montenegro, Myanmar, Ukraine, and Venezuela, the national interest and the interests of organised crime are now inextricably intertwined.\"  \nDuring the 1990s, Aruba, an overseas constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was alleged to be a mafia state under then Prime Minister Henny Eman. The Sicilian Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan was said to \"own\" over 60% of the island through investments in hotels, casinos, and donations towards Eman's election campaign. These claims later turned out to be exaggerated, however.  \nAccording to journalist Masha Gessen, in 2016, sociologist B\u00e1lint Magyar popularized the term \"mafia state\" to describe the administration of Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary. Magyar argued that Orb\u00e1n's method of taking power in Hungary, removing rivals and politicizing institutions for personal power, created a kind of regime known as a \"mafia state\". Magyar said that other states besides Hungary included Azerbaijan, Russia, and Kazakhstan as of 2016.  \nIn 2010, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had labelled Switzerland as a mafia state, stating that \"Switzerland is behaving like a criminal organisation and it is involved in money laundering, assassinations and terrorism.\"  \nJonathan Benton, the former head of a United Kingdom anti-corruption agency, described Malta as a \"mafia state\" where money laundering transactions of hundreds of millions of euros are made every year without any problem. He made this statement while speaking on BBC radio following the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\n\nQuestion: Which former leader was acquitted on charges of mafia association after a trial in their country?\nChoice list: \nA.

Georgia continued their form with two more wins against ranked opponents, as they defeated No. 18 Auburn on the road and No. 11 Kentucky at home; the former game saw Georgia play as the No. 1 team in the nation for the first time this season following Texas A&M's upset of then-No. 1 Alabama, and the latter game was the first in which Georgia allowed more than one touchdown. The Bulldogs returned to neutral site play when they faced Florida following a bye week; they defeated the Gators 34\u20137, with their three touchdowns in just over three minutes at the end of the game's second quarter contributing to the win. This was also the week that Georgia clinched the SEC East's berth in the championship game, as a result of Kentucky's loss to Mississippi State. The Bulldogs finished their conference season in much the same style as the games before; they defeated Missouri 43\u20136, and allowed a season-high 17 points to Tennessee, though still managed to win by three possessions. Georgia finished the regular season with a pair of non-conference games, as they routed the Charleston Southern Buccaneers by seven scores and their rivals Georgia Tech by the same number, concluding Georgia's first undefeated regular season since 1982. The Bulldogs fell to No. 3 Alabama in the SEC Championship Game; Georgia subsequently dropped to No. 3 and were selected for the College Football Playoff. They were picked to face No. 2 Michigan in the Orange Bowl, where they won to earn their spot in the championship game. Georgia entered the contest with a record of 13\u20131 and an 8\u20130 mark in SEC play.\n\n## Starting lineups  \nSource:  \n## Game summary  \n### First half  \nScheduled for an 8:00\u00a0p.m. EST start, the game began at 8:16\u00a0p.m. with Jake Camarda's opening kickoff resulting in a touchback. As a result, Alabama began their first drive at their own 25-yard-line. Brian Robinson Jr. got each of the game's first two carries, and Bryce Young completed passes to Slade Bolden and Jameson Williams to get first downs on the drive. Driving to the Georgia 19-yard-line, Young's pass was incomplete, forcing a 37-yard field goal attempt for Alabama, which was made by Will Reichard. Alabama's defense proved to be effective on Georgia's first drive of the game, as Christian Harris took down Stetson Bennett for a 14-yard sack; despite a 14-yard rush by Bennett a few plays later, a delay of game penalty doomed the Bulldogs to a three-and-out, and Camarda punted the ball away. The kick was fair caught by Bolden at the Alabama 20-yard line. On the second play of their ensuing drive, Young found Williams for a 15-yard gain and a first down, which would be their only first down of the drive. The Tide offense stalled and James Burnip's punt was fair caught by Kearis Jackson at the Georgia 25-yard-line. Georgia's offense was again unable to move the ball, as they gained one yard on three plays and punted the ball back to Alabama, who took possession at their own 45-yard-line after Ameer Speed was called for a kick catch interference penalty. Alabama also found themselves unable to gain a first down, and they were forced to punt the ball back to the Bulldogs four plays later after their first three-and-out of the game. Burnip's kick was caught by Jackson at the Georgia 8-yard-line. After a personal foul set Georgia back to their own 4-yard-line on their first play, the Bulldogs were able to get a first down for the first time on a 19-yard pass from Bennett to Darnell Washington, which was immediately followed by a 52-yard pass from Bennett to George Pickens, which put Georgia in Alabama territory for the first time. They advanced the ball to the Alabama 23-yard-line before the first quarter came to an end.  \nFacing a 2nd & 14 to begin the second quarter, the Bulldogs picked up a first down within two plays, and advanced the ball down to the Alabama 5-yard-line before bringing up 4th & Goal. Jack Podlesny's 24-yard field goal attempt was successful, giving Georgia their first points of the contest and tying the game at three points apiece. Alabama began their next drive at their own 25-yard-line following a touchback; their first play was a 40-yard pass from Young to Williams, though Williams went down with a non-contact injury to his left knee and left the game following that play. Young completed several more short passes on the drive but could not pick up another first down, and Alabama retook the lead on a 45-yard Will Reichard field goal with just over eleven minutes to play. Georgia started their next drive at their own 15-yard-line following a false start penalty and was unable to get past their own 22-yard-line; Camarda's punt on 4th & 8 was muffed by Bolden, who then recovered the ball back at the Alabama 26-yard-line. The first play of the drive went for a 5-yard gain, but the following play was a 61-yard completion from Young to Cameron Latu, which put Alabama on the Georgia 8-yard-line. However, Alabama's offense stalled, gaining two yards on the next two plays and then losing 13 on a sack by Channing Tindall, forcing a field goal try. Reichard's 37-yard kick was good, giving Alabama a six-point lead. After getting the ball back with seven minutes to play, Georgia reached Alabama territory in four plays, and converted a third down with a pass from Bennett to Adonai Mitchell on the next play. A sack by Dallas Turner on the following play set Georgia behind the sticks and they were ultimately not able to recover; Jack Podlesny converted a 49-yard field goal on 4th & 6, narrowing the margin to three. Alabama's final possession of the half started on their own 25-yard-line; a 24-yard pass from Young to Agiye Hall put the Tide in Georgia territory, but a pair of incompletions from Young made it fourth down. Burnip was sent back on to punt, and the kick was fair caught at the Georgia 10-yard-line. Looking to run out the clock, Zamir White ran the ball three straight times for a net total of 15 yards, which concluded the second quarter. Alabama entered halftime leading the game, 9\u20136.  \n### Second half  \nConfetti flies after Georgia finalizes its win in the title game.  \nGeorgia began the third quarter with possession of the ball, with Reichard's kickoff going out for a touchback. Zamir White carried the ball for 11 yards on the half's first play, and then again for 19 yards on the following play, earning a first down each time. An intentional grounding penalty called on Bennett on the next play, a flea flicker, set Georgia back to 2nd & 19, and they were unable to recover. Camarda was brought on to punt on 4th & 8, and his kick was fair caught by Bolden at the Alabama 7-yard-line. Alabama's first possession of the second half was brief; Young's pass was intercepted by Christopher Smith at the Alabama 43-yard-line, giving Georgia possession again. The Bulldogs were not able to capitalize off of this miscue, as they went three-and-out, gaining only three yards. Camarda's punt was downed at the Alabama 2-yard-line. The Crimson Tide escaped the shadow of their own goalposts in a few plays; Robinson's carry for 16 yards on 2nd & 9 advanced the ball to the Alabama 19-yard-line and the Tide had another first down within two more plays. They reached Georgia territory three plays after that and got the ball to the Georgia 30-yard-line before two straight incompletions brought up 4th & 11. Reichard's field goal attempt was the first of the night to be unsuccessful, as the 48-yard try was blocked by Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter, giving the Bulldogs possession at their own 20-yard-line. Georgia was quick to capitalize; running back James Cook took the ball inside the Alabama red zone with a 67-yard rush, and a pair of rushes from Bennett and Kenny McIntosh afterwards advanced the ball to the Alabama 1-yard-line. On 1st & Goal, Zamir White scored the game's first touchdown, a one-yard rush, giving Georgia their first lead of the game. Getting possession of the ball back at their own 25-yard-line, Alabama ran three plays to advance to their own 41-yard-line before the end of the third quarter.  \nAlabama began the fourth quarter with a seven-yard pass from Young to Bolden; a hands to the face penalty called on the Bulldogs' Robert Beal Jr. gave the Tide a first down on the following play and a 28-yard pass from Young to Hall took Alabama all the way down to the Georgia 5-yard-line. Two incompletions and a two-yard rush brought up 4th & Goal, and Reichard was brought on for another field goal attempt; this 21-yard try was good, bringing the Crimson Tide's deficit to one point. Georgia began their next drive at their own 25-yard-line after a touchback, but lost the ball shortly thereafter as a fumble by Bennett on the drive's third play was recovered at the Georgia 16-yard-line by Brian Branch. Alabama, starting their drive inside the red zone, benefitted from a roughing the passer call on second down and scored their first touchdown three plays later, as Young found Latu in the end zone for a three-yard passing touchdown. Young's rush on the two-point conversion attempt was unsuccessful, leaving Alabama's lead at five points. Beginning from a touchback, Georgia took to the passing game to move the ball on their ensuing drive. Bennett completed passes of 18 and 10 yards, with a 15-yard pass interference penalty in between, to move the ball to the Alabama 32-yard-line. Following a sack, Bennett connected with Adonai Mitchell for a 40-yard touchdown pass to the back corner of the end zone to reclaim the lead for the Bulldogs; the two-point rush by James Cook was no good, keeping Georgia's lead at one. Alabama went three-and-out on their next possession, with James Burnip's punt fair caught by Jackson at the Georgia 38-yard-line. Zamir White carried the ball on each of Georgia's next four plays, gaining two first downs, and the Bulldogs got another by virtue of a pass interference call on Kool-Aid McKinstry. Three plays later, Bennett connected with tight end Brock Bowers for a 15-yard touchdown, giving Georgia an eight-point lead. Driving with a chance to tie the game, Alabama gained a pair of first downs and reached Georgia territory in five plays, with just under a minute and a half to play. On 3rd & 10, following two incompletions, Young's pass downfield was intercepted by Kelee Ringo who returned it 79 yards for a touchdown, giving Georgia a lead of fifteen points. Getting the ball back with 54 seconds remaining, Alabama was able to string together a series of first-down passes, as Young found Ja'Corey Brooks for gains of 20 and 11 yards, respectively, but an intentional grounding penalty on Young set them back to their own 43-yard-line. A sack by Robert Beal set Alabama further back to their own 36-yard line, and the game concluded after two further plays. The game ended at 11:57\u00a0p.m., after a total of three hours and 41 minutes, with Georgia having defeated Alabama, 33\u201318, to win the national championship.  \n### Scoring summary  \n## Statistics  \n## Broadcasting  \nThe game was televised in the United States by ESPN, with Megacast coverage across other ESPN linear channels and streaming. The network aired a world premiere of the music video for Alesso and Katy Perry's new single \"When I'm Gone\" during the halftime report\u2014the first time ESPN had ever premiered a music video during live event coverage.  \nThe ESPN Megacast coverage spanned seven networks: the main broadcast of the game was shown on ESPN, a coaches' film room broadcast featuring Texas A&M head coach Jimbo Fisher and members of his staff was broadcast on ESPN2, the \"command center\" broadcast aired on ESPNU, the skycam feed was broadcast on ESPNews, the Spanish language broadcast was shown on ESPN Deportes, the \"hometown radio\" broadcast, featuring radio announcers from both Georgia and Alabama, was shown on the SEC Network, and the national radio broadcast was on ESPN Radio. Additionally, the individual \"hometown radio\" broadcasts, additional skycam feeds, the \"all-22\" broadcast, and the halftime marching band performances were all streamed on the ESPN app.  \nThe game was televised in Canada by TSN, which aired a simulcast of ESPN's coverage. Megacast coverage was also featured, with Skycast airing on TSN2, Command Center airing on TSN3, and Coaches Film Room airing on TSN Direct.  \n### Commentary teams  \nThe primary broadcast team from Saturday Night Football, Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, and Holly Rowe, served as the commentator, analyst, and sideline reporter for the main ESPN broadcast; Molly McGrath also joined the crew as a sideline reporter alongside Rowe. The commentary team on ESPN Deportes consisted of Eduardo Varela, Pablo Viruega, and Rebeca Landa. ESPN Radio's broadcast team consisted of Sean McDonough and Todd Blackledge, who shared the commentary booth for a College Football Playoff National Championship for the sixth time, as well as Ian Fitzsimmons and Kris Budden, who both reported from the sidelines. Two former referees contributed to the broadcasts as rules experts: Bill Lemonnier, a former Big Ten Conference official, was a part of the primary ESPN broadcast, and Matt Austin, a former Southeastern Conference official, contributed to the ESPN Radio broadcast.  \nThe \"Hometown Radio\" feeds were presented with each team's regular radio commentary teams. The Alabama feed was commentated by Eli Gold, John Parker Wilson, and Rashad Johnson, and broadcast in conjunction with the Alabama Crimson Tide Sports Network. The Georgia feed was commentated by Scott Howard, Eric Zeier, and D. J. Shockley, and was broadcast in conjunction with the Georgia Bulldog Sports Network.  \n## Aftermath  \nGeorgia's win marked their first national championship since 1980, a gap of 41 years. They finished the season with a record of 14\u20131, while Alabama finished with a 13\u20132 record. This was the first time a Georgia team had recorded 14 wins in a single season. Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett, the first walk-on quarterback to defeat a team coached by Nick Saban since 1997, was named the offensive player of the game, while Georgia safety Lewis Cine was named defensive player of the game. The win was the first for Georgia head coach Kirby Smart over Alabama head coach Nick Saban, for whom he worked as an assistant previously. The win was the first for Georgia against Alabama overall since the 2007 season, Saban's first at Alabama. Georgia also became the first No. 3 seed to win the College Football Playoff National Championship.  \nDuring the postgame handshake, Saban told Smart, \"you guys kicked our ass in the fourth quarter,\" referring to Georgia's three unanswered touchdowns to conclude the game which propelled them from a five-point deficit to a fifteen-point lead. In return, Smart asked about the condition of Alabama wide receiver Jameson Williams, who left the game with an injury in the second quarter; Saban responded that Williams had likely torn his ACL.  \nThis was the final game for Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning before his departure for the head coaching position at Oregon. He was hired on December 11, 2021, but committed to coaching Georgia through the conclusion of their season. Coincidentally, his first game at Oregon was the 2022 season opener, which was against Georgia.  \nA total of 68,311 people attended the game, making it one of seven sellouts of the 2021\u201322 bowl game season. Both of the playoff semifinals were among the list of seven, as were the Gasparilla Bowl, Music City Bowl, Birmingham Bowl, and Rose Bowl.  \nGeorgia would go on an undefeated 2022 season, and beat TCU in the next season's national championship, winning 65-7, in the largest margin of victory in any bowl game in the FBS, to become the first team since the 2012 Alabama Crimson Tide to repeat as national champions. Alabama meanwhile had an up and down season. They were the preseason #1 team but struggled in Week 2 against Texas, winning 20-19 thanks to a last-second field goal by Will Reichard. They started out 6-0 but had to pull away against #20 Arkansas and won 49-26 after nearly blowing a 28-0 lead in Fayetteville (the score was only 28-23 in favor of Alabama at one point after the Tide jumped out to a 28-0 lead), and also struggled against unranked Texas A&M at home (they had lost to the Aggies in College Station the year before on a last-second field goal by a score of 41-38), but they won 24-20. They then traveled to Knoxville where they lost to rival Tennessee for the first time since 2006 by a score of 52-49 on a game-winning field goal by Tennessee kicker Chase McGrath. They were still considered a possible contender for the College Football Playoff after only dropping from #3 to #6 in the rankings, and had a dominating 30-6 win over #24 Mississippi State, but they suffered their second loss to LSU in overtime 32-31 thanks to a successful 2-point conversion pass from Jayden Daniels to Mason Taylor. This loss knocked them out of contention for not only the Playoff but also the SEC West title, as LSU had tiebreaker wins over Ole Miss and Alabama, the other two contenders for the Western Division title. The Crimson Tide did win the remainder of their games, however, and also knocked Ole Miss out of SEC West contention. They were invited to the Sugar Bowl where they routed Big 12 champion Kansas State by a score of 45-20 after falling behind 10-0 early. They finished 11-2 (6-2 in the SEC) and ranked #5 in both of the major polls.\n\nQuestion: Which team was undefeated during the regular season according to the descriptions provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Janetta Johnson as Executive Director of the TGI Justice Project, accompanied by members of El/La TransLatinas, speaks on stage at the San Francisco Trans March 2016.\nFounded in 2004, the Transgender, Gender-Variant & Intersex Justice Project or TGI Justice Project was initially established to provide legal services to incarcerated or formerly-incarcerated transgender and gender-variant individuals. Contemporarily, the non-profit describes itself as \"a group of transgender, gender variant and intersex people\u2013inside and outside of prisons, jails and detention centers\u2013creating a united family in the struggle for survival and freedom.\u201d They focus on many facets of transgender issues, such as law and policy, human rights, imprisonment, police violence, racism, poverty, and societal pressures and stigma. The organization follows prison/police abolitionist beliefs and is working to abolish prisons and police. They also work to support Black trans leadership by putting Black trans people in leadership roles at the organization, helping community members with re-entry into society from incarceration, and supporting transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals with navigating law and legal policy. The TGI Justice Project is one of the first and only organizations to be led by formerly incarcerated trans women of color. Miss Major Griffin-Gracy was the Executive Director from 2005 to 2015.  \nWhile incarcerated from 2009 to 2012, Johnson served as the Referral Liaison to the TGI Justice Project. Miss Major remained in regular communication with Johnson while incarcerated and told her that once she was released from prison, she wanted Johnson to be the next Executive Director of the TGI Justice Project. In 2015, Miss Major retired and Johnson became the Executive Director of TGI Justice. Because the TGI Justice Project does not have enough funds to hire more employees, Johnson, as Executive Director, does the majority of the work at the non-profit.  \nDuring her time employed at the TGI Justice Project, Johnson created the program Black Girlz Rulez, which is a national Black trans convening that cultivates community and uses intersectionality to approach issues that affect Black trans women.\n\n#### Re-entry program  \nJohnson initiated TGI Justice Project's re-entry program that helps transgender and gender-variant people re-enter society immediately after being released from prison in order to prevent recidivism. While being incarcerated herself, she met many transgender women who said they had been incarcerated several times due to a lack of support during their re-entry to society. Johnson was inspired to create the re-entry program. Johnson is quoted saying, \"After I was incarcerated I decided, I\u2019m going to create a program so that Black trans women don\u2019t fall through the cracks.\u201d Now Johnson runs the re-entry program in order to prevent Black trans women from \"falling through the cracks.\"  \nThe TGI Justice Project's re-entry program aims to support transgender and gender-variant people re-enter society from incarceration through providing housing, food, money, and access to mental and physical health care services for sixty to ninety days after their release date. Johnson works with community members to arrange picking up recently-released people from their former incarceration facilities and bringing them to temporary housing in hotels or motels. The program also pays current members a salary of at least $25 an hour to financially support their re-entry to society, as Johnson claims that \"Reentry must come with a paycheck.\" Johnson notes that finding housing for the re-entry program and for trans people in general has become more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n#### COVID-19 impact  \nJohnson noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges for transgender people, saying \"any type of disease or stigma is always attached to trans people.\" Because of this, Janetta Johnson has had TGI Justice Project put a greater focus on crisis case management and general community care for transgender people during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the major ways she does this is through housing support, which has become an even more prominent issue during the pandemic. Johnson claims that seeing houseless people setting up encampments near her residence has inspired her to have empathy and create housing initiatives. During the pandemic, Johnson says she has spent many days finding hotels that will rent rooms to transgender people, as many will refuse to rent them or increase the price of rental once they learn that the prospective occupier is transgender. As of June 2020, the organization housed thirty trans and gender-non-conforming individuals. The TGI Justice Project also has volunteers bring meals and groceries to the people that they house in hotels and food and hygiene products to houseless trans people living on the streets.  \nJohnson noted that there was an increase in donations to the TGI Justice Project after the uprising about the murder of George Floyd that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n### TAJA's Coalition  \nJanetta Johnson co-founded the non-profit TAJA's Coalition in February 2015. The organization was formed in response to the murder of Taja Gabrielle de Jesus, a trans woman of color who resided in San Francisco. TAJA's Coalition aims to create safety for trans women and gender-non-conforming individuals through increasing their access to education and housing.  \n### The Transgender District  \n<ImageHere>A sign reads \"Compton's Transgender Cultural District\" at the intersection of Eddy and Mason streets in San Francisco's Tenderloin. Poles in the background are painted with the blue, pink, and white colors of the Transgender Pride Flag.In 2017, Janetta Johnson co-founded the world's first legally recognized transgender cultural district, The Transgender District, in the Tenderloin of San Francisco with Honey Mahogany and Aria Sa'id, two other Black trans women. Out of the three co-founders, Aria Sa'id is the only person who remains part of The Transgender District staff today. The District encompasses six blocks in the southeastern Tenderloin, San Francisco, and crosses over Market Street to include two blocks of Sixth Street. It contains several historically significant sites, such as the former location of Compton's Cafeteria and the Compton's Cafeteria Riot at the corner of Turk Street and Taylor Street. Turk Street and Taylor Street have been renamed by the District as \u201cCompton\u2019s Cafeteria Way\u201d and \u201cVikki Mar Lane\u201d respectively.\nJohnson and the other founders of the district were inspired to create The Transgender District after a real-estate development company named Group i announced plans to erect a new residential building and hotel in the eastern part of the Tenderloin, gentrifying the area. Brian Basinger, the Executive Director of Q Foundation, a non-profit that centers around houseless people living with HIV/AIDS in the Tenderloin, filed a declaration against Group i's plans. Basinger gathered support from the St. James Infirmary, a health clinic for people who do sex work, where Aria Sa'id served as Program Director. They accumulated more support from other community members and organizations, such as Janetta Johnson with the TGI Justice Project. Basinger's initial declaration wasn't successful, and Group i still wanted to go through with their development plans, but Group i actually ended up providing financial support so that they could establish The Transgender District.  \nThe District was originally named Compton's Transgender Cultural District after the historic August 1966 Compton's Cafeteria Riot, one of the first demonstrations of transgender resistance in the United States. The riot was a response to the police harassment of transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals, particularly transgender women.  Cross-dressing was illegal at the time due to anti-masquerading laws, which was the basis for a lot of police brutality and harassment of transgender women. A trans woman interviewed in the documentary Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria could get arrested for having the buttons on the \"wrong\" side (i.e. the left side of the shirt, where buttons tend to be placed on women's clothing). Although the riot was undocumented in newspapers, the Compton's Cafeteria Riot was \"rediscovered\" and popularized by Susan Stryker in her 2015 film Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria, which ultimately led to the creation of The Transgender District.  \nThe Transgender District's mission is \"to create an urban environment that fosters the rich history, culture, legacy, and empowerment of transgender people and its deep roots in the southeastern Tenderloin neighborhood... and to stabilize and economically empower the transgender community through ownership of homes, businesses, historic and cultural sites, and safe community spaces.\" Johnson's primary hope for the District is to create a \"safe space\" for transgender people, and she is quoted saying \"I believe in creating a space without violence, discrimination, and over-policing; and making sure Black trans women have opportunities for ownership and cultural spaces where they feel safe.\"\n\n### Legal and policy work  \nJanetta Johnson worked on the California legislative campaign to pass Senate Bill 310, commonly known as the Name and Dignity Act, which was co-sponsored by the TGI Justice Project and successfully passed in October 2017. It is a law that allows transgender people to petition the superior court to change their name and gender marker while incarcerated in California, which Johnson says makes re-entry into society easier. Johnson is quoted saying, \u201cA person exiting prison with identification documents that actually match who they are in terms of name and gender identity has an exponential impact on their ability to access life-giving services without some of the discrimination that comes with having identification documents that don\u2019t match their gender presentation.\u201d  \nDuring the pandemic, Johnson and the TGI Justice Project have provided legal support to incarcerated persons inside two prisons local to the organization, Mule Creek State Prison and Kern Valley State Prison.  \nJohnson has also formerly been a member of the Transgender Law Center's national coalition.\n\nQuestion: Which individual played a significant role in both the establishment of the TGI Justice Project and the creation of The Transgender District in San Francisco?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Trial of the Nine Trey Gangsters  \nThe trial of the Nine Trey Gangsters was a criminal case against elevenefn|Six people were initially charged on November 18, 2018. Five additional people were charged between November 2018 and January 2019. See list of co-defendants. alleged members and associates of the street gang Nine Trey Gangsters. The case is notable for its inclusion of rapper 6ix9ine, real name Daniel Hernandez, and his associate Kifano \"Shotti\" Jordan as defendants.  \nThe men were indicted on charges related to racketeering, weapon possession, and conspiracy to commit murder. Hernandez was quickly made a person of interest in these charges and was apprehended alongside five other men on November 18, 2018, following a five-year joint investigation by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the New York Police Department (NYPD), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).  \nUpon his arrest, Hernandez was initially denied bail and pleaded not guilty to all charges. He later changed his plea to guilty after agreeing to a deal with law enforcement on February 1, 2019. The guilty plea resulted in Hernandez admitting his guilt and testifying against his co-defendants, as well as full co-operation and an insistence to commit no further crimes, in exchange for reduced prison time. On December 18, 2019, Hernandez was sentenced to two years in prison, a $35,000 fine, five years of supervised release, and 1,000 hours of community service. Hernandez ended up avoiding a potential minimum sentence of 47 years. Hernandez was originally set to be released on November 18, 2020, although his attorney Lance Lazzaro claimed \"6ix9ine will be released ahead of schedule.\" His new release date was set for August 2, 2020, although reports surfaced saying he may be released as early as July 31, 2020. However, on April 1, 2020, federal judge Paul Engelmayer ordered Hernandez to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement starting the next day due to him suffering from asthma which makes him particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.  \n## Background  \n<ImageHere>6ix9ine (pictured) was arrested in the week leading up to the scheduled release of his debut album Dummy Boy.\nIn October 2018, Hernandez was sentenced to two years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service after pleading guilty to federal racketeering and firearms charges. To celebrate receiving probation instead of a jail sentence, Hernandez went to go have dinner with a music executive in New York City. His entourage was not allowed in by security, and this led to a fight that ended with one person being shot. Two members of Hernandez's entourage were charged with gang assault. Hernandez's manager Jordan later turned himself in on November 7, 2018, in relation to the fight and was also charged with gang assault.  \nOn November 15, 2018, three days prior to the arrests and a week prior to the scheduled release of his debut album Dummy Boy, Hernandez unexpectedly announced on Instagram that he had fired his entire team, including his management. He also cancelled his upcoming tour and said, \"Whoever is booking shows for Tekashi 6ix9ine, is stealing your fucking money.\"\n\n## Arrest and guilty plea  \n### November 2018\u2013January 2019: 'Not guilty' plea  \nOn the night of November 18, 2018, six men were arrested by ATF agents in New York City: Hernandez, Jordan, Jamel \"Mel Murda\" Jones, Fuguan \"Fu Banga\" Lovick, Jesnel \"Ish\" Butler, and Faheem \"Crippy\" Walter. The next night while being detained at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center, Hernandez was confronted by inmates affiliated with the rival Crips gang. Prison staff intervened and quickly transferred Hernandez to a different facility to eliminate any future gang threats. On November 22, 2018, a seventh man, Roland \"Ro Murda\" Martin, was arrested and charged with crimes related to the case. Hernandez's arrest caused his highly anticipated debut album Dummy Boy to be delayed indefinitely a day before its scheduled release.date=September 2019 After an online leak, Dummy Boy was released on November 27, 2018, and managed to reach number 2 on the Billboard 200 within only three days of charting.  \nOn November 26, 2018, Hernandez pleaded not guilty and was denied bail, with a court date set for September 4, 2019. Hernandez's lawyer continued to plea that his client was \"...completely innocent of all charges being brought against him... An entertainer who portrays a 'gangster image' to promote his music does not make him a member of an enterprise.\" An eighth defendant, Aaron \"Bat\" Young, was charged on December 19, 2018.  \n### February 2019\u2013present: Co-operation with prosecutors  \n<ImageHere>Rapper Chief Keef was allegedly shot at by Hernandez's associates after engaging in an online feud with the rapper in June 2018.\nOn January 22, 2019, three other members of the Nine Trey Gangsters were charged as part of the investigation: Kintea \"Kooda B\" McKenzie, Denard \"Drama\" Butler, and Anthony \"Harv\" Ellison. McKenzie was indicted for attempting to shoot American rapper Chief Keef in June 2018. Hernandez admitted that after becoming embroiled in an online feud with Chief Keef, he offered $20,000 to McKenzie to carry out the shooting. McKenzie carried out the attack outside the W Hotel in Manhattan, though no one was injured. After the shooting, McKenzie allegedly met with Hernandez and Jordan, settling for a payment of $10,000 for the attack.  \nButler was indicted for taking part in a separate attempted shooting of Chief Keef on July 16, 2018, where a bystander was injured by the gunfire.  \nEllison was indicted for kidnapping and assaulting Hernandez on July 22, 2018, after he claimed Hernandez disrespected the Nine Treys. At the time, Hernandez reported the incident to police in July 2018, claiming that he had been pistol-whipped and forced in a car, but soon became uncooperative during the initial investigation.  \nOn January 23, 2019, Hernandez changed his plea to guilty to all nine charges against him, and admitted to being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsters. Hernandez pledged to cooperate with prosecutors against others. As part of the plea agreement, Hernandez will not be fully prosecuted for any of his nine charges as long as he fully cooperates in testifying against others and commits no further crimes. Following Hernandez's guilty plea, prosecutors leveled additional firearms and racketeering charges against Jordan.  \nHernandez's lawyer Dawn Florio began devising a plan to get him out of federal custody before September 2019 if the other co-defendants take plea deals to avoid a trial. On March 28, 2019, Jordan became the second co-defendant to enter a guilty plea. Jordan stated that \"6ix9ine broke every code. But I forgive the little nigga after all that. It's all good\", and noted that \"Treyway still stands strong. I want that to be known.\" In September 2019, Jordan was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to one count of firearm possession during a crime and one count of firearm discharge during a crime.  \nOn April 2, 2019, Jesnel \"Ish\" Butler pleaded guilty to one firearms charge involving the April 2018 robbery of a backpack belonging to \"Scum Lord D!zzy\", the owner of Hernandez's label ScumGang. The next day, Walter pleaded guilty for involvement in the robbery as well. Jones also pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of participating in a narcotics distribution conspiracy for helping to move heroin and fentanyl. On April 19, 2019, Young pleaded guilty, becoming the sixth of the 11 defendants that have entered a guilty plea in the case.\n\n## List of co-defendants  \n## Timeline & Co-Defendants of trial  \nThe trial and its testimonies began on September 16, 2019 with Hernandez testifying for the government the next day. He disclosed the gang's inner structure and activities and later mentioned fellow rappers Jim Jones and Cardi B as members of various gangs.  \nOn October 3, defendants Anthony \"Harv\" Ellison and Aljermiah \"Nuke\" Mack were found guilty on kidnapping and racketeering charges, and currently face up to life in prison.  \nOn December 18, Hernandez was sentenced to 2 years in prison minus the 13 months already served, and 5 years of supervised liberty. On Thursday, April 2, 2020, Hernandez's lawyer, Dawn Florio, confirmed with\u00a0XXL\u00a0magazine that the court decided to allow the rapper to be released from prison and into home confinement. This was after Hernandez requested to serve the remainder of his prison sentence at home stating he was at a higher risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus due to his pre-existing asthma and bronchitis conditions. He was originally set to be released on August 2, 2020.\n\nQuestion: Which event occurred in June 2018 involving an individual from one of these images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# Country music in Atlanta  \nGeorgia Old-Time Fiddlers' Convention, 1914  \n<ImageHere>Fiddlin' John Carson\n\n<ImageHere>Gid Tanner\nAtlanta played a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists in the early 1920s \u2014 many Appalachian people such as Fiddlin' John Carson had come to the city and area to work in its cotton mills and brought their music with them. It would remain a major recording center for two decades and a major performance center for four decades, into the first country music TV shows on local Atlanta stations in the 1950s.\n\n## Origins and influences  \nMuch of the audience and many of the artists in Atlanta's country scene lived in the area's three main mill towns: Cabbagetown (Atlanta), a neighborhood in Atlanta itself, Chattahoochee, today within the city's northwestern limits and known as Whittier Mill Village, and Scottdale, just northeast of Decatur.  \nAtlanta county exhibited influences of Appalachian folk music, black music (notably blues and influences from \"Decatur Street\" black music scene) and gospel. The first \"country blues\" recording was likely in 1924, in Atlanta, by Ed Andrews.  \nAnnual Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers' Conventions took place in Atlanta in 1913\u20131935, a milestone in Atlanta's role as a marketplace for the country genre. Fiddling legend Fiddlin' John Carson placed fourth in the first convention in 1913.  \n## Radio and television  \nThe signal of WSB radio reached far into rural areas and was an important factor in creating country music \"stars\", similar to the role of WSM in Nashville. WSBs best known country music program was the WSB Barn Dance.  \nFrom August 1926 until October 1928, the Sears Agricultural Foundation hosted a radio show, broadcast from the Atlanta Sears tower (now Ponce City Market) called \"Dinner Bell R.F.D.\". R.F.D. stood for the club \"Radio Farmers' Democracy\". The show aired on WSB radio between noon and 1 pm three times a week, featuring old-time musicians and string bands  \nOther than the WSB Barn Dance and a few other exceptions, most of Atlanta's country radio programs stopped broadcasting by the early 1950s; stations broadcast recorded music. Some local country music TV programs were broadcast during the 1950s on WAGA, WLTV, and WSB-TV. Many of the local musicians turned to bluegrass music, started other careers, or pursued their careers in Nashville.  \n## Decline as a center  \nGradually, after the 1930s, Nashville became the capital of country music. In addition, Atlanta's aspirations to more \"upscale\" arts discouraged both the hillbilly band and blues scenes. From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, Atlantans supported a thriving live country music scene, but the city no longer was a major center of music recording. White flight eventually transformed Atlanta into a majority-black city that had largely abandoned Southern cultural hallmarks such as country music.  \n## Artists 1920s-1950s  \nNotable musicians active in the 1920s-1950s Atlanta scene include:  \n* Fiddlin' John Carson  \n* Gid Tanner and his Skillet Lickers  \n* John Dilleshaw  \n* Bud Landress  \n* Georgia Yellow Hammers  \n* Bill Chitwood  \n* Charles E. Moody  \n* Charles Mitchell (songwriter)  \n* Earl Johnson (fiddler)  \n* Phil Reeve  \n* Jimmie Rodgers who recorded \"Waiting for a Train\" in Atlanta in 1928  \n* Andrew and Jim Baxter  \n* Bill Lowery  \n* Robert Morland Stanley  \n## Later and current artists  \nLater country artists active in Atlanta included Jerry Reed and Kenny Rogers.  \nToday, Metro Atlanta is home to Alan Jackson, Jason Aldean, Zac Brown Band, Sugarland, Ray Stevens and Travis Tritt.\n\nQuestion: Which individual played a significant role in the early country music scene in Atlanta during the 1920s, as mentioned in the accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Byron Donalds  \nByron Lowell Donalds (born October 28, 1978) is an American politician and financial professional serving as the U.S. representative for Florida's 19th congressional district since 2021. His district, which was once represented by former Senator Connie Mack III and former CIA Director Porter Goss, serves most of the heart of Southwest Florida, including Cape Coral, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs, Estero, and Naples.  \nBorn and raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Donalds attended Florida A&M University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance and marketing from Florida State University in 2002. Before entering politics, Donalds worked in the finance, insurance, and banking industries.  Donalds represented the 80th district in the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2020.  \nDonalds was elected to Congress in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Cindy Banyai. In the January 2023 Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives election, Donalds received enough Republican votes to deny Kevin McCarthy the speakership in the fourth through 11th rounds of voting. Donalds was a candidate in the third nomination for the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election.  \nIdeologically positioned on the hard right flank of the Republican Party, he was a member of the Tea Party movement and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. In January 2021, Donalds voted to object to the certification of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election. Donalds has repeatedly claimed that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president of the United States.  \n## Early life and education  \nDonalds was born and raised in the Crown Heights neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. One of three children, he was raised by his single mother. In 1996, Donalds graduated from Nazareth Regional High School in East Flatbush. He attended Florida A&M University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance and marketing from Florida State University in 2002.  \nIn 1997, Donalds was arrested for marijuana distribution; the charges were dropped as part of a pre-trial diversion program. In 2000, he pleaded no contest to a felony bribery charge as part of a scheme to defraud a bank. His record was later sealed and expunged.  \n## Career  \n<ImageHere>Donalds and President Donald Trump in 2019 with a former inmate freed by the First Step Act\nDonalds began his professional career in 2003 as a credit analyst at TIB Bank. He was promoted to senior credit analyst in 2004, and later promoted to commercial credit manager, assistant vice president, and credit manager. Donalds left TIB Bank in 2007 and took a position as a portfolio manager at CMG Surety LLC. In 2015, he joined Wells Fargo Advisors as a Financial Advisor.  \nAfter Donalds became involved in the Tea Party movement, he was encouraged to run for office.  \nIn 2012, Donalds was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Florida's 19th congressional district. He finished fifth of six candidates. In 2014, he was reported as a likely candidate for the U.S. House in Florida's 19th congressional district after Trey Radel resigned, but did not run.  \nDonalds was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016. During his Florida House tenure, he chaired the Insurance and Banking Subcommittee.\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives  \n### Elections  \n#### 2020  \n<ImageHere>Donalds being sworn in by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\nDonalds was the Republican nominee for Florida's 19th congressional district in the 2020 election, running to succeed retiring incumbent Francis Rooney. He won a crowded nine-way Republican primary by 770 votes over State Representative Dane Eagle, finishing just over the threshold to avoid a recount. Republicans have a 550,000-voter advantage over Democrats in registration, and Florida Gulf Coast University professor Peter Bergerson noted that the Republican primary is almost always the real contest for most races in the area. In August 2020, anonymous text messages were sent out to constituents in the 19th district claiming that Donalds was dropping out of the race. Donalds later clarified via tweet that he was not dropping out and called the messages \"illegal\".  \nDuring his campaign, Donalds described himself as a \"Trump supporting, gun owning, liberty loving, pro-life, politically incorrect Black man.\" He stated his support for economic freedom, clean water, nuclear power and decreased government involvement in health care. He opposed the Green New Deal.  \nIn the November general election, Donalds defeated Democratic nominee Cindy Banyai. Donalds said he would focus on policy related to water quality in Southwest Florida. Upon his swearing-in on January 3, 2021, Donalds became the sixth person to represent this district since its creation in 1983 (it had been the 13th District from 1983 to 1993, the 14th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 19th since 2013).\n\n### Tenure in Congress  \nIn late 2020, Donalds was identified as a participant in the \"Freedom Force\", a group of incoming House Republicans who \"say they\u2019re fighting against socialism in America\". The following year Donalds was blocked from joining the Congressional Black Caucus.  \n#### 2020 Election  \nIn January 2021, Donalds voted to object to the certification of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election. Donalds has since claimed that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president of the United States, a claim he repeated in a Vanity Fair interview in July 2023.  \n#### Iraq  \nIn June 2021, Donalds was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.  \n#### Syria  \nIn 2023, Donalds was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.  \n#### January 2023 Speaker of the House election  \nOn January 3, 2023, Donalds received one vote in the 118th Congress's first election for Speaker of the House, from Chip Roy. Donalds voted for Kevin McCarthy on the first two ballots, then for Jim Jordan on the third. On January 4, on the fourth ballot, Roy nominated Donalds for Speaker, and he received 20 votes. This marked the first time two Black lawmakers were nominated for Speaker. He was nominated by Lauren Boebert on the fifth ballot, and again received 20 votes. He was sequentially nominated by Scott Perry, Dan Bishop, Andy Biggs, Matt Rosendale, and Anna Paulina Luna on the sixth to tenth ballots. He was not nominated on the 11th ballot, but still received 12 votes. Donalds switched his vote back to McCarthy after House Republican leadership made many concessions to House Freedom Caucus members.  \n#### October 2023 candidacy for Speaker  \nDonalds is a candidate for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the October 2023 election.  \n#### Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023  \nDonalds was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.  \n#### Israel  \nDonalds voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.  \n### Committee assignments  \nFor the 118th Congress:  \n* Committee on Financial Services  \n* * Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion  \n* * Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy  \n* Committee on Oversight and Accountability  \n* * Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs  \n* * Subcommittee on Government Operations and the Federal Workforce  \n### Caucus memberships  \n* Freedom Caucus  \n* Republican Study Committee  \n## Electoral history  \n### 2016  \n### 2018  \n### 2020  \n### 2022  \n## Personal life  \nDonalds and his wife, Erika, have three sons.

It started as a Brahmanical seat of learning; while in the early centuries CE it became  a prominent centre of Buddhist scholarship as well.ps= \"In the early centuries the centre of Buddhist scholarship was the University of Taxila.\"  \n## Early history of Taxila  \nAccording to the Ramayana, the city was founded by Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, and younger half brother of Lord Rama. Bharata then assigned his son Taksha to rule the city. The earliest archaeological remains of the site go back to 6th century BC. It became the capital of the Achaemenid territories in northwestern Ancient India following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley around 540 BCE. Taxila was at the crossroad of the main trade roads of Asia, and was probably populated by Persians, Greeks, Scythians and many ethnicities coming from the various parts of the Achaemenid Empire.  \n## University  \nAccording to John Marshall, Taxila emerged as a centre of learning after the Persian conquests due it's geographical position, \"at the North-Western gateway of the subcontinent,\" and the \"cosmopolitan character of her population.\" It started as a Brahmanical seat of learning. According to Frazier and Flood, the highly systemized Vedic model of learning helped establish large institutions such as Nalanda, Taxila and Vikramashila. These universities not only taught Vedic texts and the ritual but also the different theoretical disciplines associated with the limbs or the sciences of the Vedas, which included disciplines such as linguistics, law, astronomy and reasoning.  \nThe university was particularly renowned for science, especially medicine, and the arts, but both religious and secular subjects were taught, and even subject such as archery or astrology in hindu world.  \nAccording to John Marshall, \"In early Buddhist literature, paricularly in the Jatakas, Taxila is frequently mentioned as a university centre where students could get instruction in almost any subject, religious or secular, from the Veda to mathematics and medicine, even to astrology and archery.\" The role of Taxila as a center of knowledge grew stronger under the Maurya Empire and Greek rule (Indo-Greeks) in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. In the early centuries CE it was a prominent centre of Buddhist scholarship as well.ps= \"In the early centuries the centre of Buddhist scholarship was the University of Taxila.\"  \nIt was not a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in Bihar.  \nThe destruction by Toramana in the 5th century CE seem to have put an end to the activities of Taxila as a centre of learning.  \n## Teachers  \nInfluential teachers that are said to have taught at university of Taxila include:  \n* P\u0101\u1e47ini, the great 5th century BCE Indian grammarian  \n* Chanakya, the influential Prime Minister of the founder of the Mauryan Empire, Chandragupta Maurya, is also said to have been teaching at Taxila.  \n* Kum\u0101ral\u0101ta, according to the 3rd century Chinese Buddhist monk and traveller Yuan Chwang, Kum\u0101ral\u0101ta, the founder of Sautr\u0101ntika school was also an excellent teacher at Taxila university and attracted students from as far as China.  \n## Students  \n<ImageHere>Students with their oblong palettes used for writing, in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara. The young Buddha accompanying them to go to school is also part of the complete scene. 2nd-3rd century CE, Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n<ImageHere>Bhir Mound, excavation of ancient buildings.\nAccording to Stephen Batchelor, the Buddha may have been influenced by the experiences and knowledge acquired by some of his closest followers in the foreign capital of Taxila. Several contemporaries, and close followers, of the Buddha are said to have studied in Taxila, namely:  \n* King Pasenadi of Kosala, a close friend of the Buddha,  \n* Bandhula, the commander of Pasedani's army  \n* A\u1e45gulim\u0101la, a close follower of the Buddha. A Buddhist story about A\u1e45gulim\u0101la (also called Ahi\u1e43saka, and later a close follower of Buddha), relates how his parents sent him to Taxila to study under a well-known teacher. There he excels in his studies and becomes the teacher's favorite student, enjoying special privileges in his teacher's house. However, the other students grow jealous of Ahi\u1e43saka's speedy progress and seek to turn his master against him.1960 To that end, they make it seem as though Ahi\u1e43saka has seduced the master's wife.  \n* Jivaka, court doctor at Rajagriha and personal doctor of the Buddha.  \n* Charaka, the Indian \"father of medicine\" and one of the leading authorities in Ayurveda, is also said to have studied at Taxila, and practiced there.  \n* Chandragupta Maurya, Buddhist literature states that Chandragupta Maurya, the future founder of the Mauryan Empire, though born near Patna (Bihar) in Magadha, was taken by Chanakya for his training and education to Taxila, and had him educated there in \"all the sciences and arts\" of the period, including military sciences. There he studied for eight years. The Greek and Hindu texts also state that Kautilya (Chanakya) was a native of the northwest Indian subcontinent, and Chandragupta was his resident student for eight years. These accounts match Plutarch's assertion that Alexander the Great met with the young Chandragupta while campaigning in the Punjab.\n\n\nQuestion: Which individual associated with the historical Buddha is said to have studied in Taxila, according to the description provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

They fought at \"I'll Be a Mummy's Uncle\", which Mark won via DQ due to Archie being disqualified for excessive punishment, after refusing to stop ground-and-pounding.   After the match Veronica walked out with Mark and started to flirt with him. On June 2 at Chikara's second internet pay-per-view, Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, The Throwbacks defeated the team of Mixed Martial Archie and Colt Cabana in a match where the man who received the pinfall, must leave Chikara. While the referee was distracted, Mark hit Archie with his helmet and Hatfield pinned him for the win. Following the match, Veronica kissed her new boyfriend Angelosetti, while the dejected Archie walked out of the arena.  \nOn June 24, 2012, Angelosetti entered in the Chikara Young Lions Cup X tournament, defeating Jason Axe, Ryan Rush and Tripp Cassidy in the first round. Angelosetti defeated Anthony Stone on August 17, 2012 and defeated A. C. H. in the finals, winning the Young Lions Cup. On July 13, 2012, Angelosetti defeated Green Ant, to become the inaugural Banana Champion for Chikara's sister group Wrestling is Fun!. On September 14, 2012, The Throwbacks and Matt Classic entered the 2012 King of Trios, losing to Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Kaori Yoneyama and Tsubasa Kuragaki) in their first round match. After this, Mark started a feud with ACH and Veronica started to filtering with The Mysterious and Handsome Stranger. Mark defeated ACH at Under the Hood in a  match for the Young Lions Cup. After the match, Stranger appeared and humiliated Veronica, revealing himself as Archibald Peck.  On March 23, 2013, Angelosetti lost the Banana Championship to assailANT. On June 2, 2013, Angelosetti retained the Young Lions Cup against Saturyne at Aniversario: Never Compromise. Following the event, Chikara went on a break (and the Cup was deactivated), which lasted until May 2014. On July 20, Angelosetti and Dasher Hatfield defeated the Pieces of Hate (Jigsaw and The Shard) to win the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas. In September, Angelosetti and Hatfield teamed up with Chikara Grand Champion Icarus as the Golden Trio for the 2014 King of Trios. The team made it all the way to the finals of the tournament, before losing to the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). On December 6 at Tomorrow Never Dies, the Throwbacks lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to McMassive and Smashmaster. On August 11, 2018, Angelosetti defeated Juan Francisco de Coronado for the Chikara Grand Championship. However, he wouldn't compete during his reign, being Hatfield crowned as Interim Champion. On April 5, 2019, Hatfield defeated Angelosetti in a Ladder Match to claim the title. This was Angelosetti final match.  \nIn 2020, his tag team partner A VeryGood Professional Wrestler (FKA Dasher Hatfield) revealed that Angelosetti retired from wrestling.  \n<ImageHere>Angelosetti with Dasher Hatfield, as The Throwbacks\n\n\n## Championships and accomplishments  \n<ImageHere>Angelosetti and Dasher Hatfield as the Chikara Campeones de Parejas\n* Chikara  \n* *Chikara Grand Championship (1 time)  \n* *Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas (1 time) \u2013 with Dasher Hatfield  \n* *Chikara Young Lions Cup (1 time)  \n* *Tag World Grand Prix (2014) \u2013 with Dasher Hatfield  \n* Pro Wrestling Illustrated  \n* * Ranked No. 461 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2019  \n* Wrestling is Fun!  \n* *24/7 Championship (1 time)  \n* *WiF!

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Marriage coin charm  \n<ImageHere>A group of Chinese sex education coins, each showing four different sexual positions.\nMarriage coin charms ( links=yes) are a category of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese numismatic charms that depict marriage, harmonious, and/or sexual imagery. These coin charms often imitate the design of Chinese cash coins, but can exist in many different shapes and sizes.\n\n## Names  \nMarriage coin charms are known by many names, including secret play coins (Traditional Chinese: \u79d8\u6232\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u79d8\u620f\u94b1; Pinyin: m\u00ec x\u00ec qi\u00e1n), secret fun coins, hide (evade) the fire (of lust) coins (Traditional Chinese: \u907f\u706b\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u907f\u706b\u94b1; Pinyin: b\u00ec hu\u01d2 qi\u00e1n), Chinese marriage coins, Chinese love coins, Chinese spring money (Traditional Chinese: \u6625\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u6625\u94b1; Pinyin: ch\u016bn qi\u00e1n), Chinese erotic coins, and Chinese wedding coins.  \n## Types and themes  \nMarriage coin charms can display various symbols related to marriage. They may depict dates and peanuts symbolising the wish for reproduction, lotus seeds symbolising \"continuous births\", chestnuts symbolising male offspring, pomegranates symbolising fertility, brans symbolising sons that will be successful, \"dragon and phoenix\" candles, cypress leaves, qilins, bronze mirrors, shoes, saddles, and other things associated with traditional Chinese weddings. Since ancient times, three of the most important events that could occur in the life of a Chinese person in accordance to traditional Chinese culture were success in the imperial examination, which would result in a government position as well as the prestige and wealth that is associated with it, getting married, and having a large number male offspring to carry out the proper duties of filial piety and ancestor worship which were all proscribed to these sons by the Confucian system.  \n### Dragon and Fenghuang charms  \n<ImageHere>A Zhengde Tongbao (\u6b63\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6) fantasy cash coin charm featuring the image of a dragon and a fenghuang on its reverse.\nA number of marriage numismatic charms depict the image of a dragon and a fenghuang on their reverse sides, usually the obverse sides of these amulets often contain a cash coin inscription, fantasy cash coin inscription, or a more auspicious inscription related to either marriage or having plenty.  \nZhengde Tongbao (\u6b63\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6) fantasy cash coin charms commonly feature the image of a dragon and a fenghuang on their reverses, when a Chinese dragon and fenghuang are shown together they often symbolise the union of a man and a woman meaning that these Zhengde Tongbao charms were used as Chinese marriage charms. Although Gary Ashkenazy claims that the dragon and fenghuang symbolises matrimony, it is argued by Edgar J. Mandel in his book Metal Charms and Amulets of China that the dragon and fenghuang actually represent the power of the imperial Chinese government where the dragon represents the Emperor and the fenghuang the Empress. A popular saying in imperial China was \"If a household has a Zhengde coin, there will be material wealth and honour for ten thousand years\" (\u5bb6\u6709\u6b63\u5fb7\u9322\u5bcc\u8cb4\u842c\u842c\u5e74, ji\u0101 y\u01d2u zh\u00e8ng d\u00e9 qi\u00e1n f\u00f9 gu\u00ec w\u00e0n w\u00e0n ni\u00e1n).  \nSome dragon and fenghuang charms display the obverse inscription Zhouyuan Tongbao (\u5468\u5143\u901a\u5bf6), which is an inscription used by Later Zhou. Although most of the numismatic charms that display this inscription are produced during a later period, charms with this inscription are very popular throughout Chinese history.\u00a0In 956, Chai Rong, also known as Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou, had ordered that the bronze Buddha statues in the Buddhist temples, as well as all the bronze items which were owned by the people of the Later Zhou Empire, had to be turned in to the imperial government. These bronze items were confiscated in order to manufacture Later Zhou cash coins. Because Buddhist statues were used to produce these cash coins it is believed by some people that Zhouyuan Tongbao cash coins were especially auspicious, which is why they later became a very popular design for later made Chinese numismatic charms.\n\n### Fenghua Xueyue (\"Wind, Flowers, Snow, Moon\")  \nThe most common inscriptions that is found on Chinese love charms is Fenghua Xueyue (\u98a8\u82b1\u96ea\u6708) which literally translate to mean \"wind, flowers, snow and moon\".\u00a0The expression used in this inscription is most likely intentionally obscure which makes it to be open to various interpretations.\u00a0The expression Fenghua Xueyue is generally used in China in order to describe a happy and lively place, or could be used to describe something that is either frivolous or trivial. One of the more plausible explanations for the phrase Fenghua Xueyue appearing on marriage numismatic charms is that each word in this context is used to represent a different Chinese goddess.  \nThe inscription may also be a reference to the 4 volume Chinese erotic novel entitled Su'e pian (\u7d20\u5a25\u7bc7) made during the late Ming dynasty period (which was written around 1640).\u00a0The erotic novel describes the romantic adventures of a man named Wu Sansi (\u6b66\u4e09\u601d), an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang dynasty and his aunt Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty, and a concubine who was described as being \"beautiful\" named Su E (\u7d20\u5a25).\u00a0The woman Su E is sometimes also referred to as the \"Lady of the Moon\".\u00a0In the novel Wu Sansi and Su E are inspired to have sex in a variety of natural settings using 43 different sexual positions, which were all illustrated wood engravings that accompany the text of the novel.  \n### Fish  \nA design of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese marriage amulets display a pair of fish on one side and the inscription Yu Shuang (\u9b5a\u53cc; Korean: Eo ssang; Vietnamese: Ng\u01b0 Song, \"Pair of Fish\") on the other side. In various Oriental cultures fish are associated with plenty and abundance. Fish are furthermore noted for their prolific ability to reproduce and that when they swim that this was in joy and are therefore associated with a happy and harmonious marriage. In Feng Shui, a pair of fish are associated with conjugal bliss and the joys of being in a matrimonial union.  \n### Geese  \nAmong the various types of Chinese marriage charms are those that use Chinese zodiac animals as well as other animals in combination to symbolise a harmonious matrimony. For example, a Song dynasty period brass charm that is 51 millimeters in diameter with geese features all the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac in a circle on one side and wild geese on the other side. The geese on this amulet symbolise marital fidelity because of the legend that geese are monogamous and remain together for life. During marriage ceremonies in ancient China, libations were made to the geese when the bride arrived at her husband's home. This tradition goes back to antiquity: at that time, a goose was offered to the bride. This amulet also features an image of a lotus flower, which feeds the goose and reinforces the symbolism of happy union because of the homophony with the character lian, \"to unite\", \"together\". This particular type of amulet was offered at weddings.  \n### Sex education coins  \nA Fenghua Xueyue (\u98a8\u82b1\u96ea\u6708) sex education cash coin.  \nSome marriage coin charms illustrate how the newlywed couple should perform on their wedding night to meet their responsibilities and obligations to produce children. In the case of these coins, \"charm\" in this context is a catchall term for coin-shaped items which were not official (or counterfeit) money. However, these numismatic objects were necessarily considered \"magical\" or \"lucky\", as some of these Chinese numismatic charms can be used as \"mnemonic coins\".  \nSex acts were traditionally only scarcely depicted in Chinese art but stone carvings from the Han dynasty showcasing sexual intercourse were found and bronze mirrors with various sexual themes were common during the Tang dynasty. It was also during the Tang dynasty that coins graphically depicting sex started being produced. Chinese love charms often have the inscription \"wind, flowers, snow and moon\" (\u98a8\u82b1\u96ea\u6708) which is an obscure verse referring to a happy and frivolous setting, although every individual character might also be used to identify a Chinese goddess or the \"Seven Fairy Maidens\" (\u4e03\u4ed9\u5973). Other Chinese wedding charms often have inscriptions like  f\u0113ng hu\u0101 y\u00ed r\u00e9n (\u98a8\u82b1\u5b9c\u4eba), m\u00edng hu\u00e1ng y\u00f9 y\u01d0ng (\u660e\u7687\u79a6\u5f71), and l\u00f3ng f\u00e8ng ch\u00e9ng y\u00e0ng (\u9f8d\u9cf3\u5448\u6a23).  \nThese charms could also be used in brothels where a traveller could use the illustrations to make a request of a prostitute without knowing the local language.  \nA common design for Korean marriage charms displays scenes of a heterosexual couple engaging in different positions of sexual intercourse.  \n### \"Song of Unending Sorrow\" charms  \n\"Song of Unending Sorrow\" charms, or \"Song of Unending Regret\" charms, are a common type of marriage coin charm, that might be Chinese, Japanese, Korean Taiwanese, or Vietnamese in origin, that depict part of the 9th century poem Chang hen ge written by Bai Juyi. \"Song of Unending Sorrow\" charms display four heterosexual couples having sex in various positions (or they are supposed to represent one couple having in four different positions) in the area surrounding the square centre hole of the coin. Surrounding the couples having sex are the Chinese characters representing the spring (\u6625), wind (\u98a8), peaches (\u6843), and plums (\u674e), which is a reference to the first four characters of a line from the Chang hen ge poem which translates into English as \"Gone were the breezy spring days when the peach and plum trees were in bloom\" in reference to the death of Yang Guifei.  \n### Spring  \nMarriage coin charms are sometimes referred to as \"spring money\" (\u6625\u9322) or \"spring coins\" in refers to an ancient Chinese springtime ritual where young boys and young girls would be separated from each other by a stream and would then sing love songs to towards the other gender on the other side of the stream. This ancient tradition is still practiced by a number of ethnic minorities in China today.  \n### Vietnamese marriage charms  \nVietnamese marriage amulets often display dragon (\u9f8d) and phoenix (\u9cf3) motifs, this is because the Vietnamese dragon is often used as a symbol for males, while the Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng Ho\u00e0ng (or \"phoenix\") is used to represent females. When the phoenix is shown together with the dragon this is often meant as a metaphor for the Emperor and Empress.  \nSome marriage amulets have the obverse inscription Tr\u01b0\u1eddng M\u1ea1ng Ph\u00fa Qu\u00fd (\u9577\u547d\u5bcc\u8cb4) written in seal script, which translates into English to \"Long life, riches, and honour\". This inscription symbolises good fortune in marriage as well as protection. There are also some Vietnamese marriage amulets with the inscription Th\u1ecd S\u01a1n Ph\u00fac H\u1ea3i (\u58fd\u5c71\u798f\u6d77, \"longevity,  \nmountain, happiness, and sea\"), which is a part of a Chinese congratulatory phrase \"May your age be as Mount Tai and your happiness as the Eastern Sea\" (\u58fd\u6bd4\u5357\u5c71\u798f\u5982\u6771\u6d77).  \nSome Vietnamese marriage amulets contain the Daoist \u00c2m and D\u01b0\u01a1ng symbol (or Th\u00e1i c\u1ef1c \u0111\u1ed3), this is because in Daoist \u00c2m symbolises the feminine and D\u01b0\u01a1ng symbolises the masculine. Further symbols may include the lotus flower, known as \"\u8377\" (H\u00e0) or \"\u84ee\" (Sen). In Mandarin Chinese the word for \"lotus\" has a homonymous sound with the word which means \"to bind\" as in a marriage contract, \"to love\", and \"to be modest\".  \n## List of marriage coin charms by inscription  \nList of marriage coin charms by inscription:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# The Subtle Body  \nThe Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America is a 2010 book on the history of yoga as exercise by the American journalist Stefanie Syman.  \nIt spans the period from the first precursors of American yoga, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau, the arrival of Vivekananda, the role of Hollywood with Indra Devi, the hippie generation, and the leaders of a revived but now postural yoga such as Bikram Choudhury and Pattabhi Jois.  \nSeveral critics gave the book positive reviews, praising its wide range and readability; other critics gave it mixed reviews, noting its strengths, but also its lack of a strong continuous argument and its tendency to gossip.  \n## Synopsis  \n<ImageHere>Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of the World's Religions (1893)\nSyman begins The Subtle Body by describing in turn the precursors of American yoga, namely Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau. She notes that Emerson's 1856 poem Brahma concisely introduced Hindu nondualism, repudiating \"sacraments, supernaturalism, biblical authority, and ... Christianity\". Thoreau, she states, tried to practice yoga, and was seen by some as \"the first American Yogi\", but by others as \"a misanthropic hermit\". However, Syman identifies the dramatic arrival of Vivekananda and his Raja Yoga as marking the start of modern yoga, and the key moment in this as being his appearance at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago.  \nFrom there, she presents the showman Pierre Bernard and his relative Theos Bernard, including sections detailing Pierre confusing yoga with tantric sex, complete with \"lust, mummery, and black magic\", and of Theos telling a carefully fictionalised account of his experiences with Hatha Yoga in India and Tibet.  \nThe book then includes stories about a variety of straighter advocates of yoga. Syman tells the story of Margaret Woodrow Wilson, daughter of American president Woodrow Wilson, writing how she \"turned Hindu\" after she \"found peace\" in Sri Aurobindo's ashram in Pondicherry. A Hollywood connection is then explored, featuring Prabhavananda, who translated the Bhagavad Gita; Aldous Huxley; Alan Watts; and Indra Devi. The books explains how Devi came to America, unknown, having learnt yoga directly from Krishnamacharya, and how she had grown up in pre-revolutionary Russia, escaping to Berlin and going to India with her diplomat husband. It also tells of the times that Devi taught many celebrity pupils, including Greta Garbo and Gloria Swanson; in a review, Sarah Schrank notes that Syman is interested in how \"American fans, often rich and female\", made suitable environments for yoga to spread, \"shaping celebrity gurus in the process\".  \nThen Syman gives her view that, in the 1960s, the yoga scene was dominated by celebrity gurus, whether from India like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with his Transcendental Meditation, or home-grown like the \"psychedelic sages\" Ram Dass (aka Richard Alpert) and Timothy Leary, both at one time Harvard professors. It then tells how they were followed, towards the end of the 1960s, by Indian gurus of postural yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, founder of the precise Iyengar Yoga, and Vishnudevananda, founder of the more overtly spiritual Sivananda Yoga, along with Swami Satchidananda, giving the story of how the Swami made the crowds chant \"Hari Om, Rama Rama\" at the 1969 Woodstock Festival.  \nThe book ends with an account of the gurus of more energetic forms of yoga, in particular Bikram Choudhury and Pattabhi Jois.\n\n## Publication  \nThe Subtle Body was published as a hardback book by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux in New York in 2010.  \nThe book is illustrated with 25 monochrome plates, including portraits of many of the people described. Other illustrations are of the chakras from Arthur Avalon in 1919; a circus program from 1929 showing yoga-like contortions; the Hollywood Vedanta Temple; a naked woman in Laghuvajrasana, a back bend, at the Esalen Institute in 1972; and the Sri Ganesha Temple in Ashtanga Yoga New York in 2009.  \n## Reception  \nSeveral critics gave The Subtle Body positive reviews, praising its wide range and readability. Other critics gave the book mixed reviews, noting its strengths, but also its lack of a strong continuous argument, its preference for colourful stories, and its tendency to gossip.  \nOne of the warmest receptions came in the New York Journal of Books from novelist Norman Powers. He calls Subtle Body \"wide-ranging, flexible in its outlook, and satisfying in its inclusiveness, even if Ms. Syman never really defines what, exactly, yoga is.\" In his view, the result is \"really a cultural history of the United States\"; Powers notes Syman's statement that yoga \"is one of the first and most successful products of globalization\", and observes that in America it helped to weave an isolationist population \"into the fabric of the larger world\". The scholar of Eastern religions Thomas Forsthoefel almost entirely agreed with Powers in his review of the book for Nova Religio, in which he called it \"a compelling account of the complex social and philosophical interface\" created by yoga's arrival in America, also describing it as mainly a social history.  \nForsthoefel, though, sees the book's strength as Syman's storytelling, which he says provides \"key snapshots both of the sweep of yoga's evolution in America and of the lives of key figures\" in that process, so that the book reads \"almost like a novel\". The readability has been noted by academics, too: the historian Sarah Schrank, writing in American Studies, calls Subtle Body \"highly readable\" as it traces the various \"transmutations\" of yoga in America. Bob Weisenberg, writing in Elephant Journal, states that the book \"reads like a thriller\" and is \"so entertaining it clearly has an audience outside the Yoga world\".  \n<ImageHere>Pierre Bernard, a major figure in the book, pictured in Ardha Padmasana (half lotus) in an article titled \"Prizefighter Trains by Yoga Methods\", Life magazine, 1939\nAmong the most critical was the historian Jared Farmer. Writing in Reviews in American History, he calls the book relatively vivid but \"inconstant\", switching between journalistic, historical, creative, and critical writing styles. Further, in his view it \"lacks a strong argument\" and \"privileges the most colorful stories\". The most extreme of those is Syman's longest chapter, on Pierre Bernard, with Farmer writing that it \"includes bizarre love triangles, menage a trois, tantric sex, Vanderbilt heiresses, private detectives, spies, circus elephants, baseball, and heavyweight boxing.\" Though Farmer notes how Syman successfully illustrates the importance of women in shaping yoga in America, particularly Indra Devi, he affirms that today's yoga did not come straight from Devi; he instead asserts that, in the 1960s, modern yoga split into a mind-oriented stream with Transcendental Meditation and the Hare Krishnas, and a body-oriented stream with Iyengar. These are covered variously in other parts of the book.  \nIn another review, the literary critic Michiko Kakutani, writing in The New York Times, states that Syman deftly traces how Emerson and Thoreau enabled yoga to take root in America, providing a \"lively gallery of larger-than-life characters\" in the story of American yoga. Kakutani notes Syman's many \"entertaining anecdotes\" but states that the book fails to cover either yoga's ancient history or to show how the various schools of yoga evolved. Almost entirely disagreeing with Kakytani, Claire Dederer, writing in Slate, calls the book an \"exhaustive historical survey\". She notes that Syman writes of Devi that to her, yoga refers only to the asanas, calling this \"a turning point ... from esoteric pursuit to health-giving practice available to all.\" In Dederer's view, Syman \"does a wonderful job of showing how yoga, like a virus, has kept evolving in order to survive\", but all the same Dederer wonders if Syman wasn't trying too hard. Similarly, Tara Katir, writing in Hinduism Today, states that Subtle Body \"proceeds systematically\", and is \"engaging, if at times a bit gossipy.\"\n\n\nQuestion: Which historical figure is credited with marking the start of modern yoga with his appearance at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, according to the descriptions provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

As a part of the change of ownership, the social network pages have also been rebranded as Microsoft Lumia rather than Microsoft Mobile; this sought to emphasize the Windows Phone over other Nokia mobile phones while also updating social network pages of Windows Phone to the new Microsoft Lumia branding. To reflect this change, Nokia Conversations was also rebranded as Lumia Conversations, and NokNok.tv to Lumia Conversations UK. However, the rebranding has not been consistent, as the Nokia Army was renamed the Spartan Nation and the support site for legacy phones, accessories, various Nokia-branded devices, and services, originally Nokia Discussions, was renamed the Microsoft Mobile Community. The Lumia Beamer was the last Lumia-branded application to have its URL changed from Nokia to Lumia, signifying the end of the transitional term during which Microsoft was allowed to use Nokia.com and related sites.  \nHowever, in October 2014, Microsoft officially announced that it would phase out the Nokia brand in its promotion and production of Lumia smartphones, and that future Lumia models would be branded solely with the name and logo of Microsoft. In November 2014, Microsoft announced its first self-branded phone, Microsoft Lumia 535. Rebranding the Lumia line did not affect sales, though some critics believed that it might negatively influence consumers' decisions due to Nokia's established reputation for durability compared to the relative infancy of Microsoft's brand in the consumer phone space. The Nokia Lumia 638 was the last Lumia product to bear the Nokia brand, and was only released in India in December 2014.  \nIn November 2014, a post by a Microsoft Twitter account stated that all Nokia and Microsoft Lumia smartphones running Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 would receive updates to Windows 10; however, following the official unveiling, Microsoft denied this, stating that they instead were targeting the \"majority\" of Lumia phones and that not all phones would receive the update or support all of its features. Later, Microsoft confirmed that low-end devices with 512\u00a0MB of RAM (including the Nokia Lumia 520, which represents 24.5% of all Windows Phone devices sold), would also get the Windows 10 upgrade, but reaffirmed that not all of its features would be supported on these devices. Additionally, Microsoft stated on January 16, 2015, that low-end Windows Phone 8.1 phones will not get some Lumia Denim features.  \nIn July 2015, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft had a planned restructuring of Microsoft Mobile, which includes the Microsoft Lumia range. This would reportedly include a write down of approximately US$7.6 billion on the acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business and a layoff of around 7,200 employees. It was also reported that Microsoft would release fewer first-party devices each year. As part of a larger restructuring, the Microsoft Devices & Studios engineering group was merged with the Operating Systems Engineering Group to form the larger Windows & Devices Engineering Group. In July 2015, it was announced that the head of Surface, Panos Panay, would head the new Microsoft devices unit, which would include the Microsoft Lumia as well as various other Microsoft hardware products such as the Band, HoloLens, and Xbox.  \nIn October 2015, Microsoft launched the first Lumia devices running on Windows 10 Mobile: the Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550. In February 2016, the Lumia 650, which also runs Windows 10 Mobile, was launched. Sales of Lumia devices declined between fiscal years 2015 and 2016, with phone revenue decreasing by $4.2 billion or 56%. When Microsoft announced the acquisition in September 2013, 7.3 million devices were sold in the quarter, but this shrunk to 1.2 million at the quarter ending June 2016. Since the Lumia series make up 95% of total Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile sales, the operating system market share also shrunk along with it. Throughout 2016 Microsoft slowed down production volumes of Lumia devices, and it was speculated that the series would be discontinued by the end of 2016.  \nShortly after the discontinuation of the Elite X3, HP's attempt to bring Windows 10 Mobile to a niche market, Microsoft's corporate vice president Joe Belfiore confirmed that Microsoft would no longer sell or manufacture new mobile devices. The existing devices would receive bug fixes and security updates only.\n\n## Lumia updates  \nNokia and Microsoft Mobile have released several updates unique to Lumia devices which feature a combination of firmware and software updates. The latter of these includes imaging improvements, new technology support, feature updates, and bug fixes. Because Lumia devices exclusively use Windows Phone, major operating system updates are often bundled with the firmware updates upon release.  \nSimilar to how Windows Phones receive operating system updates, Lumia update releases are dependent on carriers who decide if and when devices are to receive them. However, operating system updates are not subject to these constraints if users are part of Microsoft's Windows Insider or Preview for Developers programs.  \n## List of Lumia devices  \nAll devices in the Lumia line were smartphones (including one tablet computer) running Microsoft Windows software. All the smartphones were full-touch in a candybar form. There were no QWERTY devices, although there were reports in 2012 that Nokia was working on such device similar to the Nokia Eseries. An alleged prototype device with full keyboard was leaked in 2017.  \n### Numbering convention  \nThe first digit (or the first two digits for devices with four-digit model numbers) indicates the device's family, with larger numbers generally denoting a higher-end device. Under Nokia, numbers larger than 10 indicated a phablet (e.g. 1320, 1520) or tablet (2520). Following the sale of the Lumia line to Microsoft, four-digit model numbers were discontinued, with larger models instead being denoted by an \"XL\" suffix (e.g. 950 XL).  \nThe second digit indicates the generation of the device, based on the operating system it originally shipped with:  \nThe third digit is used to distinguish between variants in the same family and generation. 0 indicates the base model, while other numbers indicate either a minor upgrade (e.g. 920 and 925), a 4G-capable variant (e.g. 730 and 735) or a regional or carrier-specific variant.  \nAn optional \"C\" or \"T\" suffix indicates a variant produced exclusively for the Chinese market.  \n### Nokia-branded Lumia devices  \n### Microsoft-branded Lumia devices  \n## Comparison of Lumia smartphones  \n## Sales  \nGraph of quarterly global sales (million units)  \nImageSize  = width:auto height:250 barincrement:60  \nPlotArea   = left:50 bottom:15 top:10 right:18  \nAlignBars  = justify  \nPeriod     = from:0 till:11  \nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical  \nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:0  \nPlotData=  \ncolor:skyblue width:47 align:center  \nbar:Q4.2011 from:start till:1 text:1  \nbar:Q1.2012 from:start till:2 text:2  \nbar:Q2.2012 from:start till:4 text:4  \nbar:Q3.2012 from:start till:2.9 text:2.9  \nbar:Q4.2012 from:start till:4.4 text:4.4  \nbar:Q1.2013 from:start till:5.6 text:5.6  \nbar:Q2.2013 from:start till:7.4 text:7.4  \nbar:Q3.2013 from:start till:8.8 text:8.8  \nbar:Q4.2013 from:start till:8.2 text:8.2  \nbar:Q1.2014 from:start till:8 text:8  \nbar:Q2.2014 from:start till:7.4 text:7.4  \nbar:Q3.2014 from:start till:9.3 text:9.3  \nbar:Q4.2014 from:start till:10.5 text:10.5  \nbar:Q1.2015 from:start till:8.6 text:8.6  \nbar:Q2.2015 from:start till:8.4 text:8.4  \nbar:Q3.2015 from:start till:5.8 text:5.8  \nbar:Q4.2015 from:start till:4.5 text:4.5  \nbar:Q1.2016 from:start till:2.3 text:2.3  \nbar:Q2.2016 from:start till:1.2 text:1.2  \nbar:Q3.2016 from:start till:1 text:1\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the devices shown in the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Regional Committee of Communists in Macedonia  \nThe Regional Committee of Communists in Macedonia was the provincial communist organization in Vardar Macedonia from 1939 to 1943.  \n## History  \n<ImageHere>Shatorov was the leader of Macedonian communists in 1941. He was killed under unknown circumstances in September 1944. There are indications he was eliminated by Tito's order as a politically inconvenient leader.\nAt the beginning of 1939, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia decided that Vardar Macedonia should form a regional committee. Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107 was sent to Skopje in August of that year, and the local committee was organised under his leadership on 8 September. Blagoje Orlandi\u0107, another Serb, was chosen as secretary.  \nAfter organising a large demonstration in Skopje in December, Orlandi\u0107 was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. In February 1940, a new regional-committee leadership was elected at a meeting; Metodi Shatorov was elected secretary. In June, a national regional-committee program was drawn up. A September 8, 1940 conference was held near Skopje, at which a political resolution was drafted and new leadership was elected. Under Shatorov's leadership, the Macedonian regional committee followed Communist International (Comintern) policy and maintained close ties with Georgi Dimitrov.  \nAfter the Bulgarian  takeover of Vardarska Banovina in April 1941, the Macedonian communists fell into the Communist Party of Bulgaria's sphere of influence under Sharlo's leadership. When the directive to organise an armed resistance movement in all regions of occupied Yugoslavia was issued, Sharlo disobeyed the order. He told the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) that the situation in Macedonia did not permit immediate military action; propaganda should precede the formation of military units. Sharlo refused to define the Bulgarian forces as occupiers (contrary to instructions from Belgrade), however, and called for the incorporation of the local Macedonian Communist organisations into the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). The Macedonian regional committee refused to remain in contact with the CPY, and joined the BCP. Sharlo refused to distribute a CPY proclamation calling for military action against Bulgarians.  \nBecause of the conflict within the Macedonian CPY regional committee, there was no resistance movement in Vardar Macedonia. The Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention at the beginning of World War II, arguing that the war was an imperialist conflict between national ruling classes. When the Soviet Union was attacked by Nazi Germany, however, the Comintern issued a directive ordering the formation of communist resistance movements in all European fascist-occupied territories and the Macedonian regional committee (RC) began organizing resistance. The RC (headed by Shatorov) immediately ordered the formation of partisan units \u2013 the first of which was formed in the Skopje region on 22 August 1941 \u2013 and attacked Bulgarian guards on 8 September in Bogomila, near Skopje. With the help of the Comintern and Joseph Stalin, the Macedonian Communists were attached to the CPY. Soon after this, Shatorov lost his popularity in the CPY and was discredited. Consequently he moved to Sofia, where he began working as one of the Bulgarian resistance movement leaders.\n<ImageHere>Svetozar Vukmanovic welcomes Macedonian and Greek Partisans in 1943 in occupied Greek Macedonia. Under his leadership, the pro-Bulgarian Regional committee was disbanded and pro-Yugoslav Macedonian Communist Party was founded.\nCPY loyalists were next appointed as leaders of the RC, with Lazar Koli\u0161evski secretary; in September 1941, Koli\u0161evski was sent to Skopje. The new leadership began forming partisan detachments. Armed insurgents from the Prilep partisan detachment attacked Axis-occupied zones in Prilep, including a Bulgarian police station, on 11 October. This date is considered the symbolic beginning of the Macedonian resistance. In November, Koli\u0161evski was arrested and sentenced to death by a Bulgarian military court. He wrote two appeals for clemency (to the Bulgarian tsar and the defence minister), insisting on his Bulgarian origin. Koli\u0161evski's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was imprisoned in Pleven, Bulgaria. The Prilep detachment was active until December, when it split into three groups: the first in Skopje, the second in Tikve\u0161, and the third in Bitola.  \nSharlo's leadership was terminated, but elements of his policy were preserved by some of the local communist activists. After the arrest of Lazar Koli\u0161evski, the new executive body of the Macedonian RC continued to share Shatorov's pro-Bulgarian ideas and re-established contact with the BCP. Bane Andreev of Veles, Macedonia's new party secretary, expressed this ideology. He thought that the Macedonian people believed in Bulgaria's role as liberator, and no Macedonian wanted to fight Bulgarian soldiers; Macedonians should answer the Bulgarian mobilisation call and join the Bulgarian army. Josip Broz Tito, however, disagreed. Bane Andreev was arrested by Bulgarian police in the spring of 1942, worsening the struggle between pro-Bulgarian and pro-Yugoslav factions; Cvetko Uzunovski created a provisional regional committee which attempted to take over the pro-Bulgarian faction, with little success.  \nAlthough several Macedonian partisan detachments were formed through the end of 1942 which fought Bulgarian, Italian, German and Albanian occupation forces (and despite Sofia's mismanaged administration), most Macedonian communists were not yet lured to Yugoslavia. Between 1941 and 1943, Tito sent five emissaries to Macedonia to persuade his poorly-disciplined comrades; their efforts had limited success, however, and the regional committee was under the de facto control of the BCP. At the beginning of 1943, the Montenegrin Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107 (\"Tempo\") was sent as an assistant to Macedonian partisan headquarters to change that. Tempo tried to organize an energetic resistance and was tasked with setting up a Macedonian communist party within the Yugoslav party. Some of his objectives were to destroy the influence of the BCP in Macedonia and to fight any form of autonomism.  \nVukmanovi\u0107 had to Macedonianize the struggle and give it a new ethnic-Macedonian facade. One of his main achievements was that wartime pro-Bulgarianism receded into the background of pro-Yugoslavism. He capitalised on the increasingly-contradictory attitudes of Bulgarian authorities, which adopted a policy of centralisation in 1942 (contradicting their initial agenda of respecting Macedonian autonomy). Yugoslav communists proclaimed as their aim the unification of Macedonia's three regions (Yugoslav, Greek and Bulgarian), attracting Macedonian nationalists. Tempo began to organise armed resistance to Bulgarian rule in earnest. Under Yugoslav pressure, the regional committee was dissolved and replaced by the Communist Party of Macedonia (KPM, part of the Yugoslav Communist Party). Formed on 19 March 1943 in the Albanian occupation zone in Tetovo, its first central committee was composed primarily of pro-Yugoslav communists. Yugoslav communists recognized a separate Macedonian nationality to stop the fears of the local population that they would continue the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. They didn't support the view that the Macedonian Slavs are Bulgarians, because that meant in practice, the area should remain part of the Bulgarian state after the war.\n\n## Regional Committee's leadersLeadership  \n-  Bla\u017eo Orlandi\u0107 (September 1939 - March 1940)  \n-  Metodi Shatorov (March 1940 - August 1941)  \n-  Lazar Koli\u0161evski (September 1941 - November 1941)  \n-  Bane Andreev (November 1941 - May 1942)  \n-  Cvetko Uzunovski (June\u2013September 1942)  \n-  Kuzman Josifovski Pitu (September 1942 - March 1943)\n\nQuestion: Which individual played a key role in changing the pro-Bulgarian stance of the Macedonian communist movement to a pro-Yugoslav orientation during World War II?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\n<ImageHere>George Miller provided input during the game's pre-production period.\nA video game set in the Mad Max universe was mentioned by franchise creator George Miller in a 2008 interview. Miller joined God of War II director Cory Barlog to develop the game after Barlog left Sony Computer Entertainment. The project was originally intended as a tie-in with a Mad Max animated film which would be released simultaneously. The film's production was suspended to allow adequate production time for the game. After Barlog announced in 2008 that a publisher for the game was being sought, no further information about the project was forthcoming. In 2010, Barlog was a consultant for Avalanche Studios, leaving in 2012 for Crystal Dynamics. A Fury Road tie-in video game was in development by Interplay Entertainment, but was scrapped when Electronic Arts acquired the franchise's video-game rights for $20 million.  \nOn 14 February 2013, a blurry screenshot of the game was released by Avalanche Studios founder and CEO Christofer Sundberg. The game was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 on 10 June at Sony's press conference, with a scheduled 2014 release for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Although Sundberg said during the expo that Miller and Barlog's project was not the Mad Max game announced by Avalanche, he later said that Barlog had worked on a Mad Max game at Avalanche. Despite the unclear relationship between the projects, according to the game's design director, Miller had collaborated with Avalanche during the game's pre-production in mid-2011. Despite having Miller to offer input, Warner Bros. was inclined to give much creative freedom to Avalanche. Full production of the game began before May 2012.  \nIn April 2014, Avalanche announced that Mad Max would be delayed until the following year, making it one of the titles released during Avalanche's \"biggest year since its inception\". The game was retooled during development. Despite its release that year, the game is not directly connected to 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road and was not intended to be a tie-in; its setting and story are original. This decision was made because the game's publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, believed that a standalone game was more beneficial to players than a \"play-the-movie game\" after the success of its Batman: Arkham series. Locations which have appeared in the films, such as Gas Town and Thunderdome, are featured in the game. Unlike previous Avalanche games, such as Just Cause 2, the game's tone is more mature and its narrative is emphasized.  \nSimilar to the films, Max seldom speaks or expresses emotion; his thoughts are reflected by his actions. The team aimed at developing a complex character and personality for him. According to the game's director, Max is traumatized by past experiences (such as losing his family); this makes him \"insane\", \"unstable\", and \"mad\". These qualities are reflected in the game's \"rage\" mode, in which Max inflicts additional damage on enemies. Chumbucket, Max's mechanic and companion, is obsessed with the Magnum Opus; according to the game's lead writer, he \"has a pseudo-religious/sexual relationship with engines\". Scabrous Scrotus, the game's main antagonist, is a warlord designed as a \"bloodthirsty monster that only can find solace from his own pain through the suffering of others\". Enemies' faces are painted and scarred; according to game director Frank Rooke, their appearance \"is kind of the approach of how this civilization merged into this kind of state\".  \nLead designer Emil Krafting said that gameplay was the top priority during development. Like the Just Cause series, Mad Maxs developer aimed to give players autonomy by providing tools to create their own events. The studios intended to build a dynamic world, creating \"a seamless series of events\". The game was inspired by the atmosphere of the Mad Max universe, rather than a particular film in the series. According to Avalanche, they did not plan to be influenced by other post-apocalyptic video games such as Fallout, Rage, and Borderlands since most of those games were inspired by the original Mad Max. The company said that the game's vehicular combat posed a challenge because of their inexperience with that type of game. The car customization system was designed to increase the game's fun factor and give players more freedom.  \nleft  \nThe game's world was inspired by the Just Cause series, which features large sandboxes for players to explore. Avalanche Studios CEO Christofer Sundberg hoped that players would compare Mad Maxs desert setting to the western setting of Red Dead Redemption. The game world is scaled according to gameplay density and frequency; the development team emphasized creating a world with choices and distractions, rather than focusing on size. Designed as dead, threatening, and hostile, it is also exciting and engaging (encouraging exploration). One challenge faced by the developers was building a wasteland with a variety of environments, since Mad Max is Avalanche's first post-apocalyptic game. They spent most of their time designing ground and terrain variations to minimize repetition in the landscape. Since the game is set in a desert, the team used vibrant colors for the sky. Avalanche Studios sent a team to a Costa Rican jungle to inspect local landscapes and environments in preparation for creating the world of Mad Max, particularly its sky. Like the films, the game does not identify the apocalypse; its developers wanted to give \"a sense of mystery\" to the wasteland so players could imagine how the wasteland evolved. Garages allowing players to upgrade and repair their cars were originally intended to be featured in the game. The idea was later scrapped, since the studio thought the element \"interfered with gameplay\".  \nMad Max is powered by Apex Engine (formerly known as Avalanche Engine), an in-house proprietary engine developed by Avalanche and also used in Just Cause 2. According to lead graphics designer Alvar Jansson, new graphical features were introduced to the engine during the development of Mad Max and it was designed and optimized for open-world games. The team also worked on improving the world's draw distance and ensuring that gameplay across the three major platforms have no significant difference.  \nGaming journalists invited to preview a private gameplay demonstration at E3 2013 noted that Max had an American accent, rather than the Australian accent of the film series, and fans protested his new American voice; Avalanche Studios later confirmed that he would have an Australian accent. Donal Gibson, the brother of the original Mad Max star Mel Gibson, expressed interest in taking the lead role in the video game adaptation. However, Australian actor Bren Foster, who previously starred in The Last Ship and Days of Our Lives, was chosen for the role. The game's setting is described as \"wasteland creole\", with elements of a number of civilizations, so its characters have a variety of accents.\n\n### Release  \n<ImageHere>Promotion at Gamescom 2015\nMad Max was released on 1 September 2015 in North America and the United Kingdom, 2 September in Australia, 3\u00a0September in New Zealand and 4 September in Europe for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was announced on 3 May 2015 that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions had been cancelled due to hardware restrictions, but a Linux port was announced. The game was released for Linux and macOS on 20 October 2016.  \nPlayers who pre-ordered the game could receive the Ripper, an additional Magnum Opus design. The Ripper, a steelbook, collector's box, mini-license plate and Blu-ray copy of Mad Max: Fury Road were included in the Post-Apocalypse Edition. PlayStation 4-version purchasers could access a Road Warrior Survival Kit, with twelve hood ornaments for the Magnum Opus, exclusively until 30 November 2015. To promote Mad Max, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment sponsored launch events. In Australia, the company invited artists to create artwork on their vehicles with dust. They joined Uber for a Seattle promotion in which Uber users could access a free ride \"straight from the post-apocalypse\". The offer was free, since \"dollars are worthless in the wasteland\".\n\n## Reception  \n### Critical reception  \nMad Max received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.  \nIts story received a mixed response. Brandin Tyrrel of IGN found the story surprising and genuine, despite most of the action occurring later in the game. Tyrrel wrote that the characters have different personalities and distinct qualities, and considered them the \"true star\" of the game. According to Chris Carter of Destructoid, the game's story engages the player. Leon Hurley of GamesRadar found the overall story weak and \"barely existing for the majority of the game\", but thought the game's climax was exciting. Matt Bertz of Game Informer also criticized the story, calling it thin and light, and called the voice actors' performances uneven.  \nMad Maxs world design received generally positive reviews. According to Brandin Tyrrel, it captured the films' savage tone and the game's sandbox was a \"gorgeous\" setting for players to explore. GamesRadar's Leon Hurley praised the game's scale, which he compared to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer compared its scale favorably to Avalanche's previous Just Cause game series, and opined that Avalanche had successfully combined the Mad Max universe with an open-world game design. Matt Bertz praised the game's inhospitable atmosphere, commending Avalanche for adding a variety of styles and a vibrant sky to an otherwise-boring sandbox. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers echoed Bertz, calling each region unique and distinct. Bloodworth also praised Avalanche for its efforts in crafting the world. Peter Brown of GameSpot praised Mad Maxs natural disasters, writing that it set a new standard for in-game weather effects. Philip Kollar of Polygon criticized the game's layout, writing that every location in the game feels identical and its bland environments discourage exploration.  \nTyrrel considered the vehicular combat one of the game's best elements, adding a layer of creativity. Brown praised the car action, calling it intense, complex, and unpredictable, but criticized the over-simplistic and shallow on-foot combat. Carter compared the game's vehicular controls to the best racing games, and commended its handling. He also praised the car mechanics, writing that it has offered players a cinematic experience. Tyrrel liked the additions to the game's combat (such as the introduction of weapons and the Fury mode), writing that they added depth to the combat. Hurley praised the game's progression system, which he found satisfying, and the balance between vehicular and on-foot combat. Bloodworth wrote that the melee combat used a \"tried-and-true system\" which worked well, despite awkward camera angles. Kollar criticized the boss fights, which he thought lacked variety.  \nOther gameplay aspects received mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised the customization system for Max and the Magnum Opus, since the customization impacts the gameplay and makes the overall experience more rewarding; Kollar echoed this. Brown criticized the game for failing to offer much challenge or a sense of accomplishment to players. He called the health system a redundant addition in which resources, such as water and food, play an insignificant role and can be neglected by players. Brown also criticized the scrap-collecting system, writing that it frustrated most players and slowed the game's pace. However, Robinson wrote that those elements reflect the barbarian nature of the wasteland. He praised its world design (which he thought echoed the films), describing it as \"a world of twisted metal and sudden violence that's there to be survived rather than conquered\". Bloodworth criticized the game's stronghold system, which he called repetitive. Brown criticized the game's lack of a climbing system, which hinders movement; this was echoed by Carter.  \nMad Maxs quest design also received mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised the content and activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for most players. However, he disliked the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the objectives are unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought nothing new to the genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.  \nThe game had some technical problems when it was released. Tyrrel noted an unstable frame rate and occasional texture pop-up, and Kollar identified audio problems.  \n### Sales  \nMad Max was the second-best selling game in the United Kingdom in its first week of release on the United Kingdom software retail chart, only behind Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, which was released the same day. According to the NPD Group, it was the eighth-best selling game in the United States in September 2015.\n\nQuestion: Which notable figure from the Mad Max franchise provided input during the pre-production period of the Mad Max video game?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nBernard Dujon (second from the left) and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob (right) attending a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting in the 1980s.\nIn Gif-sur-Yvette, Bernard Dujon started to study a strange genetic phenomenon, linked to mitochondrial genetics, whose study was still in infancy. When crossing two haploid yeast species carrying different mitochondrial mutations, conferring the resistance to erythromycin or to chloramphenicol, allele segregation did not follow mendelian rules and recombinants appeared in mysterious proportions. At that time, no one had any idea of the genetic content of mitochondria, except that it contained DNA. Bernard Dujon was studying a particular mitochondrial locus, called omega, that could be present as two different alleles, omega+ or omega-. Genetic crosses between yeast cells carrying different alleles led to highly distorted inheritance in the progeny, since almost all cells ended up carrying the omega+ allele! In 1974, he proposed a model in which gene conversion of the omega- allele to omega+ was achieved by homologous recombination, replacing one allele by the other, copying in the process the flanking erythromycin and chloramphenicol mutations.  \nAt about the same time, recombinant DNA technologies and restriction enzymes were discovered. In 1977, independent researches by Fred Sanger on one side and by Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam on the other, led to the invention of two different methods to sequence DNA. Later the same year, introns were discovered. Thermal denaturation studies with Fran\u00e7ois Michel, another student of Piotr Slonimski, suggested that omega could be an intron. Bernard Dujon contacted Walter Gilbert at Harvard University about the possibility to come to his lab for a short post-doctoral period, in order to sequence the omega locus. He moved to Harvard the following year and in 1979 achieved the sequence of what would become the first mobile intron to be described. But the most surprising result was not that omega was indeed an intron, but that it contained an open reading frame, putatively encoding a 235 amino acid protein with no homology to any known protein. At that time, no intron was supposed to be coding. Could it be that the encoded protein played a role in the intron mobility between omega- and omega+ strains ?  \nBack to Gif-sur-Yvette in 1981, Bernard Dujon set up a small team in an old lab space lent by Piotr Slonimski. Fran\u00e7ois Michel rapidly joined him and later on Alain Jacquier, Hugues Blanc, Pierre Dehoux and Laurence Colleaux, as well as sabbatical visitors such as Walt Fangman from the University of Washington. They discovered that the omega intron was present in other yeast species collected in Harvard. Following the sequencing of several other introns, Fran\u00e7ois Michel discovered that these introns could be folded into stem-loops whose structures (if not their sequences) were conserved. This suggested that they could be directly involved in the splicing mechanism by defining exon-intron junctions. In addition, they discovered that two different intronic structures existed, defining what they called group I and group II introns, a nomenclature still in use today. They published their models of intron folding in Biochimie in 1982 and this article quickly became a reference for researchers in the field.  \nBut the precise function of the omega-encoded protein was still unknown. Bernard Dujon decided to adapt the mitochondrial gene to the universal genetic code in order to be able to express it in a heterologous system. At that time, it was a real tour de force, since oligonucleotide synthesis and in vitro mutagenesis were uncommon and not available in Gif-sur-Yvette. Fortunately, Bernard Dujon met Francis Galibert, who was working at the H\u00f4pital Saint Louis in Paris and who just came back from Fred Sanger laboratory to set up his own lab. At that time, he was the only one in France to be able to synthesize oligonucleotides. With the help of Francis Galibert's oligonucleotides, Bernard Dujon modified 26 of the 235 codons of the omega reading frame to adapt it to the universal genetic code. Synthesis of the resulting protein in Escherichia coli, in the presence of a plasmid carrying the omega-sequence showed without any ambiguity, in 1985, that the omega protein was a double-strand DNA endonuclease, as was predicted by the model 12 years ago. This nuclease took afterwards the conventional name of I-SceI, the first intron homing endonuclease discovered, first of its kind but dozens of others would rapidly follow.  \nIn 1987, a call for a yeast geneticist was published by the Institut Pasteur. Bernard Dujon applied and left Gif-sur-Yvette to move to Paris. In this new scientific environment, he used I-SceI to the purpose of making unique double-strand breaks in complex genomes, such as mouse, plants or the human genome, in collaboration with many scientists worldwide. In collaboration with the laboratory of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas at the Institut Pasteur, Arnaud Perrin and Andr\u00e9 Choulika (who would later become two founding members of the biotech company Cellectis) were able to do the first gene replacement in mouse cells using I-SceI, at the same time Maria Jasin in United States was doing similar experiments in human cells.\n\n### The yeast genome project  \nThe \"yeast teams\" of the Institut Pasteur in 1995. Pierre Legrain (second from the right) and Alain Jacquier (not on this picture) set up their own yeast laboratory in 1995, as the first \"bud\" of Bernard Dujon (left) laboratory. Several young researchers and students on this picture have since set up their own laboratory.  \nIn 1988, Andr\u00e9 Goffeau, a Belgian yeast geneticist from the University of Louvain-la-Neuve convinced the European Commission to support the complete sequencing of the yeast genome. Under his management, 30 European laboratories collaborated to this endeavor. Their goal was to sequence 10 kb of DNA in two years of time, in order to complete chromosome III sequence, one of the smallest ones. Later on, they were joined by other labs worldwide to help sequencing the 15 other chromosomes. Bernard Dujon took an active part in this project and was one of the leading figures of the yeast program. He coordinated the sequencing of two chromosomes out of sixteen (XI and XV) and the map of a third chromosome (VII) was made by Herv\u00e9 Tettelin, Andr\u00e9 Goffeau's student, using the I-SceI chromosome fragmentation technology developed in the meantime. The yeast genome sequence was completed in 1995 and published one year later. During the course of this project, it was discovered that one third of the sequenced genes had no homologue in any database (the so-called \"orphans\"). The extremely high level of gene redundancy, due -at least in part- to an ancient whole-genome duplication in the ancestor of Saccharomyces species, led to a new era in biology. Genomics, freshly born as a new science, will be studying entire genomes, instead of individual genes, and try to understand genome organization and evolution.  \n### The G\u00e9nolevures program  \nBernard Dujon laboratory at the departemental retreat in Normandy, in 2002. From left to right (standing): Bernard Dujon, Romain Koszul, Ingrid Lafontaine, Martine Rambaud, Stefan Pellenz, Jeanne Boyer, Christophe Hennequin, Emmanuel Talla, Agn\u00e8s Thierry, Odile Ozier-Kalogeropoulos, Fredj Tekaia, Gilles Fischer, C\u00e9cile Fairhead. From left to right (sat): Guy-Franck Richard, Emmanuelle Fabre.  \nWhile Bernard Dujon was participating to the EUROFAN program, aiming at determining the function of all discovered genes, he started a completely different approach, based on yeast comparative genomics. Odile Ozier-Kalogeropoulos and her Master student, Alain Malpertuy, had produced 600 sequence reads of a yeast of biotechnological interest, Kluyveromyces lactis. This allowed them to identify hundreds of new genes by direct comparison with the S. cerevisiae genome. By analogy with Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) that were widely used at that time as a proxy to estimate the number of different human genes and their expression tissues, Alain Malpertuy coined these sequences Random Sequence Tags (RST) and the acronym was subsequently kept for further similar studies.  \nFollowing an informal discussion with Jean Weissenbach, head of the G\u00e9noscope, the largest sequencing center in France, Bernard Dujon contacted two French geneticists who were known to be interested in non-conventional yeast species: Jean-Luc Souciet at the University of Strasbourg and Claude Gaillardin at the National Center for Agronomy (INRA) in Grignon. Together, with several French laboratories sharing similar scientific interests, they decided to sequence to low coverage 13 yeast species representing the various branches of the Saccharomycotina (formerly known as Hemiascomycetes), some of them of biotechnological or medical interest. At the end of the year 1998, the G\u00e9noscope offered 50 000 sequence reads for this project, 40 millions of nucleotides, roughly corresponding to 0.2-0.4 X coverage of each of the 13 genomes. Altogether, 20 000 new genes were discovered and allowed to compare sequence divergence, synteny, gene redundancy and functions among these 13 species and between them and S. cerevisiae. These yeasts revealed at the level of their genomes, large evolutionary distances between them . Their comparison made possible to develop new theories on the molecular mechanisms of evolution of eukaryotic genomes which, thanks to the power of genetics in S. cerevisiae, can be directly subjected to experimentation. Results were published in a special issue of FEBS Letters, edited by Horst Feldman and appeared in press just a few days before the end of the 20th century.  \nBernard Dujon and one of his PhD students, Stefan Pellenz, at the Institut Pasteur in 2004.  \nFollowing this project, a landmark for subsequent yeast comparative genomics studies, the CNRS offered to support the French consortium, under the name G\u00e9nolevures (levure being the French word for yeast). Note that the financial support was limited to coordination, but did not cover sequencing nor subsequent data analysis. The G\u00e9nolevures consortium sequenced to completion four yeast genomes, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii and Yarrowia lipolytica. Numerous functional and comparative studies were made from these sequences, including genes involved in replication, recombination and repair, mating and meiosis, short and long tandem repeats, tRNA genes, introns, pseudogenes, telomeres and subtelomeres and evolution of the genetic code. These results were published in Nature, as well as in several other scientific journals.  \n### The origin of genes and chromosomal amplifications  \nSequencing yeast genomes led to the discovery of many new genes of unknown function, phylogenetically unrelated. This led to the question of their very origin. Bernard Dujon tried to tackle this problem by setting up an experimental system to study the evolution of tRNA genes. During the course of these experiments, he discovered that yeast strains in which an essential amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase had been replaced by its homologue from Yarrowia lipolytica, a distantly related yeast, were severely unfit. However, normal growth revertants appeared in the culture at a high frequency. Whole-genome sequencing of these mutants showed that the chromosomal segment containing the foreign tRNA synthetase had been amplified by a rolling circle mechanism, creating a variety of aberrant chromosomal structures under constant evolution. While looking for tRNA duplication, Bernard Dujon discovered the amplification of its cognate tRNA synthetase.  \n### Interspecific hybridizations  \nFascinated by interspecific hybridizations that spontaneously occurred frequently in nature, Bernard Dujon last scientific project was to create artificial yeast species resulting from forced hybridization between two known yeast species and to study genome evolution of these new hybrids. This was the PhD project of Lucia Morales, last of the many students trained by Bernard Dujon over the course of his long career. Making these hybrids at the bench proved to me much more challenging than initially expected, suggesting that laboratory conditions may not favor interspecific hybridizations between distant yeast species.  \n### Bernard Dujon legacy  \n<ImageHere>Bernard Dujon (left) and his colleagues (Eric Westhof), wearing the \"Habit vert\" of the Institut de France.\nBernard Dujon retired in 2015, at the age of 68 and became Emeritus Professor. Over the 26 years during which the Unit\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire des Levures was operating, more than 120 people have worked there, 250 scientific publications were produced shared with more than 800 colleagues all over the world and 22 PhD thesis and Habilitations \u00e0 diriger des recherches were defended. As Bernard Dujon put it at the end of his retirement talk, in March 2016: \"Scientific research was a successful globalization.\"  \nMany of his former students or post-docs have continued in biological research or related fields, many of them obtaining positions in academic research and starting their own lab in France or abroad (alphabetically): Guillaume Chanfreau (UCLA), Laurence Colleaux (Institut Imagine), Alain Jacquier (Institut Pasteur), Romain Koszul (Institut Pasteur), Emmanuelle Fabre (H\u00f4pital Saint Louis), C\u00e9cile Fairhead (Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay), Gilles Fischer (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9), Bertrand Llorente (Universit\u00e9 Aix-Marseille), Fran\u00e7ois Michel (Gif-sur-Yvette), Anne Plessis (Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot), Emmanuel Talla (Universit\u00e9 Aix-Marseille), Herv\u00e9 Tettelin (University of Maryland) and Teresa Teixeira-Fernandes (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9).\n\n### Scientific books  \nBernard Dujon is the author of a vulgarization book on genetics, as well as of a textbook entitled Trajectoires de la g\u00e9n\u00e9tique. He recently published a recollection of his scientific -and personal- life in FEMS Yeast Research.  \n## Honors and awards  \nHe is a member of Academia Europaea (since 2000), a member of the French Academy of sciences (since 2002), and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Inventors since 2017.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Music of Portal 2  \nPortal 2 is a physics-based puzzle-platform game created by Valve and released on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Linux in April 2011, followed by a Nintendo Switch version in June 2022. The game, set in the desolate, labyrinthine Aperture Science facility, challenges the player to navigate test chambers created by the artificial intelligence GLaDOS, using a portal gun, a device able to create portals that link two points in space like a wormhole. The game expands on the original Portal by adding new puzzle elements, such as paint that imparts properties to surfaces, plates that can launch the player and objects over distances, tractor beams and bridges made of light.  \nThe game's music includes original scores composed by Valve's Mike Morasky, and two original songs provided by Jonathan Coulton and the band The National. The bulk of the music was released as a freely-available download across three volumes, entitled Songs to Test By, and later in a four-disc retail Collector's edition that included music from Portal.  \n## \"Want You Gone\"  \n<ImageHere>Jonathan Coulton, who provided the song \"Still Alive\" for the first Portal, was asked to compose the game's final credits song, \"Want You Gone\".\nJonathan Coulton's song \"Still Alive\", which is sung by GLaDOS (voiced by Ellen McLain) over Portals end credits, was considered a large part of Portal's success; in designing Portal 2, Valve desired to incorporate more music into the game, including further involvement from Coulton. Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, \"Want You Gone\", also written from GLaDOS's viewpoint. Coulton had discussed with Erik Wolpaw about whether an ending song would be necessary, and how they could create \"an emotional moment\" comparable to \"Still Alive\", back in 2009 when Portal 2s ending was not yet determined. Other options were considered, such as several \"joke songs\" and false endings for the game. Ultimately the game's finale, where GLaDOS effectively \"breaks up\" with Chell, was set by the last quarter of 2010, and Coulton played the game as it had been developed to that point to generate ideas. Elements of the ending, such as Chell being told to leave Aperture with the door slamming behind her, led to the development of main chorus line \"I used to want you dead, but now I only want you gone.\" Coulton wrote the lyrics and composed the song over the course of several days, with John Flansburgh assisting on electronic drums, and traveled to Valve's headquarters in January 2011 to record it with McLain.  \nIn addition to its inclusion in the Portal 2 soundtrack, a version of \"Want You Gone\" as sung by Coulton appears on his 2011 album Artificial Heart.\n\n## \"Exile Vilify\"  \n<ImageHere>The band The National worked with Valve to create the haunting \"Exile Vilify\" used in conjunction with one of the dens of the Rat Man within the game.\nThe indie rock band The National provided another original song, \"Exile Vilify\"; its lyrics were composed by the group and reviewed by Valve to ensure they fit with the tone of one of the Rattmann's dens, where it appears in-game. The National had expressed an interest in doing music for Valve to Bug Music, their publishing label, which the label forwarded on to Valve in discussing other music opportunities for the game. Valve and Bug Music identified that The National would fit well into Portal 2, as their \"raw and emotive music evokes the same visceral reactions from its listeners that Portal does from its players\" according to Bug Music's spokesperson Julia Betley. The song is considered by Paste to be a \"haunted, piano-lead ballad\" similar to the band's song \"Think You Can Wait\"  used in the film Win Win. \"Exile Vilify\" is not included in the freely downloadable Portal 2 soundtrack, but instead was released as a digital single by the band.  \nAfter the game's release, Valve and The National ran a contest encouraging users to create their own music video for \"Exile Vilify\", offering as prizes Valve merchandise and a guitar signed by members of the band. Of 320 videos submitted, Valve ultimately awarded two videos first prize. One video featured a sock puppet that \"had nothing to do with Portal\" but \"managed to beautifully capture the spirit of the song\", while the other provided an animated retelling of the Lab Rat comic.\n\n## Original music  \nValve's Mike Morasky was the lead composer for the game's backing music. In keeping with the theme from Portal, Morasky wanted to create music that kept an \"old future through a new lens\" approach, such as by using minimalist electronic piano or mangled chiptunes. He also wanted to create music that would sound like it would have been composed by a computer, citing the use of \"stiff arpeggios, math-like voice leading, odd rhythm patterns and whole tone scales\" as a means to achieve this. Morasky also incorporated the briefly-seen singing turrets\u2014all voiced by McLain\u2014 in the piece \"Cara Mia Addio!\" after recalling that she was a former opera singer, and used snippets of her singing to create something that still sounded synthetic. Except for McLain's vocals, all the music is based on synthesized or sampled sounds, and even with McLain, her voice was resampled to make it sound like a computer. McLain wrote \"GLaDOS' Song\" (possibly better known as \"Don't Say Goodbye\") from the character's point of view, showing GLaDOS' more sentimental connection to Chell. She intended it to be an Easter egg, though it was not used in the game. Jagger Gravning of Vice later had her record the song with her husband John Patrick Lowrie, and Lowrie uploaded it to YouTube in 2015.  \nMorasky created procedurally generated music, which is generated in real time based on the player's actions. This type of music system was based on the previous success of incidental music used in the Left 4 Dead series, and was developed to create a generalized platform for reuse in future Valve productions. Such music is generated by the player's interaction with various puzzle objects in the test chambers, such as launching from an Aerial Faith Plate. Morasky designed the procedure to build out the music more as the player completed more of each puzzle. Morasky also saw this as a means to provide experimentation to the player, exploring both space and timing of events to alter the composition of the music.  Morasky claims that one piece of music \"only repeats itself every 76,911 years, 125 days, 7 hours, 56 minutes and 30.3 seconds\". Morasky designed this dynamic music as a reward for successfully completing puzzles.  \n## Songs to Test By  \nSongs to Test By is the three-volume soundtrack for Portal 2, containing nearly all of the music from the game.  The soundtrack was released freely to the Internet volume-by-volume between May and September 2011.  Along with the soundtrack, Valve included several Portal 2-themed ringtones.  \n### Soundtrack listing  \nAll tracks are written by Mike Morasky unless otherwise noted.  \nA retail four-disc collection, Portal 2: Songs to Test By (Collector's Edition), was released on October 30, 2012 through Ipecac Recordings. Three of the discs include the music already available (listed above), while the fourth disc includes songs from Portal. A mini-comic, \"Turret Lullaby\", is also included.  \n## Reception  \nKym Dillon of IGN used the soundtrack of Portal 2, amongst a few other soundtracks, as an example how a game can use both source music (music that is part of the game environment) and underscoring (music that is only for the player) to create atmosphere in games; Dillon also mentions that he \"especially\" liked the game's soundtrack. Alyssa Grimley of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised Morasky's composing of the soundtrack and called it an \"understated genius\". She also praised Jonathan Coulton's song \"Want You Gone\" for the way in which it reflects the changed spirit of GLaDOS when compared to \"Still Alive\" from the first game. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku listed Portal 2 as possessing one of the best musical scores in video games for 2011, praising both the composed songs and the dynamically-generated elements.  \nFor the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, both \"Want You Gone\" and \"Exile Vilify\" were nominated for \"Best Song in a Game\", while the soundtrack was nominated for \"Best Original Score\". Portal 2s soundtrack was awarded for \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\" at the 15th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. The game was awarded the \"Best Audio\" 2012 Game Developers Choice Awards. The Game Audio Network Guild awarded Portal 2 with the \"Best Interactive Score\" (along with Kinect Disneyland Adventures), and \"Best Original Vocal - Pop\" for \"Want You Gone\".\n\nQuestion: Which artist or band was involved in creating an original song for the game Portal 2's ending credits?\nChoice list: \nA.

British troops occupying the Togolese capital of Lom\u00e9 on the coast, had advanced towards a wireless station at Kamina, mi inland on hills near Atakpam\u00e9. The only routes inland were by the railway and road, which had been built through dense and almost impassable jungle.  \nTwo trainloads of German troops steamed south to engage the British and delay the Anglo-French invasion but were ambushed at Agbulovhoe, suffered many casualties and fled, leaving mi of the railway to the north intact. After a halt of three days to accumulate supplies, the British advance resumed with support from French lang|fr|Tirailleurs S\u00e9n\u00e9galais. The German colonial forces were capable of only one more defensive action at the Affair of Khra on 22 August. The Germans blew up the wireless transmitter at Kamina on the night of 24/25 August and the colony was surrendered the next day.  \n## Background  \n### Strategic developments  \nAn Offensive Sub-Committee of the British Committee of Imperial Defence was appointed on 5 August and established a principle that command of the seas was to be ensured. Territorial objectives were considered if they could be attained with local forces and if the objective assisted the priority of maintaining British sea communications, as British army garrisons abroad were returned to Europe in an \"Imperial Concentration\". Attacks on German coaling stations and wireless stations were considered to be important, to clear the seas of German commerce raiders. Objectives at Tsingtau, Luderitz Bay, Windhoek, Duala and Dar-es-Salaam were considered and a German wireless station in Togoland, next to the British colony of Gold Coast (now Ghana) on the Gulf of Guinea, was considered vulnerable to attack by local forces.  \nThe high-power wireless transmitter had been built at Kamina and controlled German communication in the Atlantic Ocean, by linking a German transmitter at Nauen near Berlin with German colonies in west Africa and south America. At the outbreak of war, the German acting-Governor of Togoland, who had 152 paramilitary police, 416 local police and 125 border guards but no regular army forces, had proposed neutrality to the British and French colonial authorities under the Congo Act 1885 and then withdrawn from Lom\u00e9 and the coastal region, when the British demanded unconditional surrender. The acting-Governor, Major Hans-Georg von Doering had sent an un-coded wireless message to Berlin disclosing his plan to retreat to Kamina, which had been intercepted by the British and led to offensive operations against Kamina being authorised by the Colonial Office on 9 August. Anglo-French expeditions from northern Dahomey, Nigeria and the Gold Coast began on 12 August.  \n### Tactical developments  \nOn 6 August 1914, the British and French governments summoned the German authorities in Togoland to surrender; Anglo-French forces invaded the colony and occupied Lom\u00e9 unopposed on 7 August and by 12 August, the southern portion of the colony was under Anglo-French control. In northern Togoland British and French troops, police and irregulars occupied Yendi and Mango on 14 August. In the south, the lang|de|Polizeitruppen had withdrawn to the wireless station at Kamina, about order=flip inland. As British and French forces advanced towards Kamina, the German commanders, acting-Governor Major Hans-Georg von Doering and the military commander, Captain Georg Pf\u00e4hler attempted to delay the Allied advances by blowing bridges. The main British and French thrusts came from the south, where well built roads and railways from the coast made movement easy for both sides. To harass the West African Rifles of the West African Frontier Force (WAFF), German commanders filled two trains with  200 German soldiers and sent them south to raid the Allies on 15 August 1914.  \n## Engagement  \n<ImageHere>Gulf of Guinea, showing the location of Togo and the modern states of Ghana and Benin (formerly Dahomey)\nBy 14 August the British had reached Tsevi\u00e9 unopposed and patrols reported the country south of Agbeluvoe clear of German forces. The main British force assembled at Togblekove and \"I\" Company (Captain H. B. Potter) was sent forward by road to Agbeluvoe, followed by the main body on 15 August. When the main force reached Dawie, civilians reported that a train full of Germans had shot up the station at Tsevi\u00e9 earlier that morning. At Tsevi\u00e9 the British found that the train had steamed north and hurried on to support \"I\" Company. \"I\" Company had heard the train run south at 4:00 a.m. while halted on the road near Ekuni. A section was sent to cut off the train and the rest of \"I\" Company pressed on to Agbeluvoe. A local civilian guided the section to the railway, where Lieutenant H. S. Collins and the section piled stones and a heavy iron plate on the tracks, about m north of the bridge at Ekuni, a village about km south of Agbeluvoe and then set an ambush.  \nA second train, carrying Captain Georg Pf\u00e4hler, commander of the German forces in Togoland, stopped in front of the obstacle and managed to reverse before the ambushers reached it. The rest of \"I\" Company had heard the train pass, set another ambush and riddled the engine with bullets as it travelled past at full steam. The British parties rendezvoused and advanced to Agbeluvoe, where another road and rail block was established. Both trains were south of Agbeluvoe and the convoy of carriers with \"I\" Company's supplies was harassed by German attacks for two hours before they arrived at the British position. The position at Agbeluvoe had been attacked several times from the south; more attacks overnight were repulsed. As the main British force drew close, the Germans retired towards their train and eventually surrendered. The main force under Colonel F. C. Bryant had been engaged by a German party on the afternoon of 15 August at the Lila River, where the Germans blew the bridge and then retired to a ridge where they fought a delaying action holding up the British until 4:30 p.m. Three German dead were left behind; the British lost one man killed and three wounded. When the advance resumed the British reached Ekuni and found twenty railway carriages, which had been derailed by the obstruction near the bridge.\n<ImageHere>Dahomey\u2013Togo boundary. LOC 85697543\nMany of the German soldiers reportedly took off their uniforms, threw down their guns and ran into the bush at the sight of the British ambush. The remaining Germans retreated northwards to Agbeluvoe where further fighting ensued, in which Pf\u00e4hler was killed.2003 A German prisoner wrote an account in September, which described the German force at Agbeluvoe as two companies of local soldiers, commanded by Pf\u00e4hler. An attempt to break through the \"I\" Company road and rail block collapsed when the Togolese troops refused orders and then began shooting in all directions. Six Germans were killed including Pf\u00e4hler, after which the troops fled; the remnants failed to contact Kamina and news of the disaster was eventually delivered by a German train driver who had been fired on at Agbeluvoe.  \nNext morning Baron Cordelli von Fahnenfeldt, who had designed the wireless station at Kamina and the German explosives expert were captured; the column set off for Agbeluvoe, no news having arrived from \"I\" Company. Slight opposition was met half way to the station and much abandoned equipment was found. Firing was heard until about km from Agbeluvoe, where most of the  200 German troops from the trains were found to have been captured, along with two trains, wagons, a machine-gun, rifles and much ammunition. The Germans who escaped proved too demoralised to conduct demolitions and km of track were taken undamaged. The British lost six killed and 35 wounded, some of whom had injuries which raised suspicions that the Germans had used soft-nosed bullets, which was later discovered to have been partly true, as some hurriedly incorporated reservists had used their civilian hunting ammunition.\n\n## Aftermath  \n### Analysis  \nThe Germans lost a quarter of their troops in the attempt to use the railway to harass British forces to the south. It was considered a great failure and defeat for the Germans in Togoland. Although it may briefly have delayed the British northward advance, which was not resumed until 19 August, the Affair of Agbeluvoe had no lasting effect on the advance of the Allies. The wireless station at Kamina was demolished by the Germans, which cut off German ships in the South Atlantic from communication with Europe and influenced the Battle of the Falkland Islands (8 December 1914). On 26 August, eleven days after the battle, Doering surrendered. The German force of  1,500 men comprising one German and seven Togolese companies, had been expected to be most difficult to defeat, given the terrain and the extensive entrenchments at Kamina. A German prisoner later wrote that few of the Germans had military training, the defences of Kamina had been too large for the garrison to defend and were ringed by hills. The Germans were not able to obtain information about the British in the neighbouring Gold Coast (Ghana) and instructions by wireless from Berlin only insisted that the transmitting station be protected. In the first three weeks of August, the transmitter had passed 229 messages from Nauen to German colonies and German shipping. Defence of the transmitter had wider operational effects but Doering made no attempt at protracted resistance.  \n### Casualties  \nThe British suffered  83 casualties and the German forces  41 casualties at the Affair of Agbeluvoe.  \n### Subsequent operations  \nOn 22 August the Affair of Khra was fought by the Anglo-French invaders and the Germans on the Khra River and in Khra (Chra) village. The German forces had dug in and repulsed the Anglo-French attack. A new attack on 23 August found that the Germans had retired further inland to Kamina. By the end of the campaign, six of seven provinces had been abandoned by the Germans, bridges had not been blown and only the Khra river line among the three possible water obstacles had been defended. The speed of the invasion by several British and French columns, whose size was over-estimated and lack of local support for the colonial regime, had been insuperable obstacles for the German colonialists. Togoland was occupied by the British and French for the duration of the war.\n\nQuestion: Which event is depicted in the descriptions of the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nDavid Chase in 2015\nThe origins of what ultimately took shape as The Many Saints of Newark happened when David Chase finished film school, having the idea of making a film about four white persons living around Newark, New Jersey, who joined the National Guard to avoid being drafted to the Vietnam War only to be sent instead to the 1967 Newark riots, though the film went unproduced. Following the release of The Sopranos, it was suggested by Oz creator Tom Fontana that Chase write a film centered on Tony Soprano's father Giovanni \"Johnny Boy\" Soprano set in the 1930s or 1940s. However, the idea eventually fell off due to Chase's lack of interest.  \nChase ruled out the idea of continuing The Sopranos story in June 2017, while simultaneously expressing an interest in a prequel to the series. He had earlier been against the idea of making a film based on The Sopranos, especially a sequel to the series, given James Gandolfini's death in 2013, but became interested in Newark due to the 1967 Newark riots and his family ties to the city: \"I was interested in Newark and life in Newark at that time\u00a0... I used to go to down there every Saturday night for dinner with my grandparents. But the thing that interested me most was Tony's boyhood. I was interested in exploring that\", acknowledging that a prequel film could explore the period of Tony's life that he glorified in the show's early episodes.  \nChase said that the main storyline centers on the 1967 Newark riots and racial tensions between the Italian-American and African-American communities. Chase's biggest challenge during writing was the inclusion of many storylines for different characters; some aspects of those storylines were dropped during editing to let the storylines \"take shape\" within the film's overall narrative.  \nIn March 2018, New Line Cinema announced that it purchased the rights to produce the film along with HBO Films, with Chase co-writing the screenplay with Lawrence Konner. New Line's chairman, Toby Emmerich, stated, \"David is a masterful storyteller and we, along with our colleagues at HBO, are thrilled that he has decided to revisit, and enlarge, the Soprano universe in a feature film\". Chase was not concerned about alienating audiences unfamiliar to the show; for him and Konner, their intention was to tell a realistic and respectable dramatic criminal story, under the \"auspices\" of The Sopranos.  \nAlan Taylor, who directed several episodes of The Sopranos, was hired to direct the film in July 2018. Chase offered Taylor to direct the film one day while they lunched together, feeling that Taylor had worked in the show's best episodes and had given him \"the most trouble\". In contrast to the show, Taylor felt that Chase allowed more creative control over the film than when he ran the show, as Chase spent most of the time outlining the story sequestered in the writer's room.\n\n### Casting  \n<ImageHere>Alessandro Nivola stars as Dickie Moltisanti\nIn November 2018, Alessandro Nivola was cast to star in the film as Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher Moltisanti. Dickie never appeared in the show despite being mentioned, though Chase did not have any plans to feature the character physically then. In January 2019, while discussing the 20th anniversary of the series, Chase revealed that a young Tony Soprano would appear in the film. Jon Bernthal, Vera Farmiga, Corey Stoll and Billy Magnussen were added to the cast that same month.  \nMichael Gandolfini, son of James Gandolfini, was cast in the role of young Tony. He was not immediately cast and had to audition for the role, but Taylor and Chase felt that they were right in casting him when Gandolfini thanked all the production team for allowing him to \"say hello and goodbye again\" to his father. Gandolfini, having never watched The Sopranos, watched through it to prepare for the role, describing it as an intense process. To keep Gandolfini's performance from being too similar to that of his father, Taylor occasionally reshot a scene if Gandolfini acted like he were already an experienced gangster, as the young Tony is \"still a kid\" during the film.  \nRay Liotta joined the cast in February, with Leslie Odom Jr. and Michela De Rossi joining in March, as well as John Magaro, who starred in Chase's debut feature film Not Fade Away (2012). Liotta had been previously approached by Chase to appear in the third or fourth seasons of The Sopranos, but the plan did not work out.  \nEdie Falco filmed scenes as her character Carmela Soprano which were intended to start the film, but her scenes were cut. Taylor explained, \"There was some confusion as to how best launch the movie. How to start the movie. So we tried a few things and that was one of them. If you've seen the movie you'll see that we begin it in a very different way now but that wasn't always the idea\".\n\n### Filming  \nPrincipal photography began in Brooklyn on April 3, 2019, moved to Newark on May 7, and wrapped up in June 2019, with a $50 million budget. Branford Place, a street in Newark, was transformed to fit the 1960s time period for the riots, including detailed storefronts, the old Adams Theater marquee, and the neon sign for Hobby's Delicatessen. Retired Newark police officer Luther Engler served as a technical adviser for the film.  \nFilming also took place in Bloomfield. Satriale's Pork Store was featured in The Sopranos and was recreated in Paterson. Planned reshoots were halted upon the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the production ultimately returned for reshoots in September 2020, during which the filmmakers shot some important aspects that improved the film's story.  \nThe film uses the 1967 Newark riots as a backdrop for the tensions between the Italian and black communities. To accurately depict the riots, Taylor directly recreated some of the film shots from archival photos and footage of the event.  \nDuring post-production, there were some serious talks about whether the film's depiction of the Newark riots would still seem appropriate in the wake of the George Floyd protests, but Taylor concluded that the film's treatment of the riots would avoid controversy. Christopher Tellefsen worked as the film's editor. The editing process took longer than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the film industry, though Taylor felt that the extended period helped him and Chase to discuss what the film's final cut would consist of.  \n## Release  \nThe film was initially scheduled to be released on September 25, 2020; however, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on theaters and the film industry, its release date was rescheduled to March 12, 2021. It was then delayed again to September 24, 2021, so it could premiere on the film festival circuit and better position itself as an awards contender, before later moving to October 1.  \nThe film was simultaneously released in theaters and on HBO Max (for a limited period of 31 days), as part of the 2021 Warner Bros. film release schedule plans. The film had its world premiere at the inaugural Tribeca Fall Preview at the Beacon Theatre on September 22, 2021, the same date as the film's early release in the United Kingdom.  \nThe film was released on Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD and DVD on December 21, 2021. Special features include deleted scenes and two featurettes\u2013\"Making of Newark\" and \"Sopranos Family Honor\". It debuted at the 33rd position for overall disc sales in the United States according to the \"NPD VideoScan First Alert\" chart, and the 18th position in Blu-ray sales. Blu-ray accounted for 60% of sales, with traditional Blu-ray making up 48% of the sales and Ultra HD Blu-ray making up 12%.  \n## Reception  \n### Box office  \nThe Many Saints of Newark grossed $8.2million in the United States and Canada, and $4.8million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $13.1million.  \nIn the United States and Canada, The Many Saints of Newark was released alongside Venom: Let There Be Carnage and The Addams Family 2, and was projected to gross around $10 million from 3,180 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $2.1 million on its first day, and debuted to $5 million, finishing fourth at the box office. Following its less-than-expected opening weekend, Variety wrote that the film \"stands to lose millions\". The film dropped 69% in its second weekend to $1.9 million, finishing fifth.  \n### Streaming viewership  \nThe Many Saints of Newark was a streaming success; according to Samba TV, it was viewed one million times during its opening weekend. It outperformed similarly budgeted films such as Reminiscence and Cry Macho that were released on HBO Max, with WarnerMedia stating that it was streamed three times more than the second-most viewed film of the weekend. The Sopranos also broke HBO Max viewership records around the time of the film's release, attributed to The Many Saints of Newark sparking renewed interest in the series. By the end of its first month, the film had been streamed in more than 2.1 million households in the United States. During its second week of availability on HBO Max, the film was the eighth most-streamed film in the United States, according to TV Time.  \n### Critical response  \nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of score based on count reviews, with an average rating of average. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Even as its storytelling chafes at the edges of its cinematic constraints, The Many Saints of Newark proves The Sopranos allure is still powerful.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it a 77% positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.  \nIn a review for The Boston Globe, Don Aucoin said that \"as a Goodfellas-ish crime drama that vividly evokes time and place, Saints is rendered with enough bare-knuckled verve, unpredictability, and darkly glinting wit to make it work.\" In a positive review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper called the film \"a sharply honed, darkly funny, ultra-violent and wildly entertaining late 1960s period piece\" and an \"immensely satisfying companion piece to The Sopranos\", giving it 3.5 stars out of 4.  \nOwen Gleiberman of Variety called Many Saints \"a sharp, lively, and engrossing movie, one that provides a fascinating running commentary on how the world of The Sopranos came into being\" but noted \"the audience can't help but notice the difference in tone\" when compared to the series. David Fear of Rolling Stone said in his review \"Chase has delivered something that walks the tightrope between social melodrama and fan service, and that sometimes teeters on the edge of falling.\"  \nManohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \"a busy, unnecessary, disappointingly ordinary origin story\" and said that \"the best thing about The Many Saints of Newark is that it makes you think about The Sopranos, but that's also the worst thing about it.\" Reviewing the film for RogerEbert.com, Glenn Kenny gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars and said:  \n\"The movie's flabbiness, its unfocused flopping from scene to scene, its disinclination to provide any individual scene with any dimension beyond its immediate impact, practically vitiates the entire theme of Dickie's ostensible mentorship of Tony Soprano.\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote: \"The Many Saints of Newark, by contrast, reduces characters of potentially mythic power to a handful of defining traits and pins them to a diorama-like backdrop of historical readymades.\"  \n## Possible sequel  \nChase has expressed interest in producing a sequel to The Many Saints of Newark which follows Tony Soprano in his 20s, provided that he could collaborate with former Sopranos writer Terence Winter. Upon hearing this, Winter replied that he would do it \"in a heartbeat. Absolutely.\"  \nChase revealed that he received an offer from WarnerMedia to produce another season of The Sopranos which bridged the gap between the end of the film and the beginning of the original series, but admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that he was not especially interested in making such a series. However, he noted that he wished to make one more film set in The Sopranos universe because he had an idea of what he might do. \"But I don't think they want that.\"\n\nQuestion: Which individual was cast to star as Dickie Moltisanti in the prequel to The Sopranos?\nChoice list: \nA.

B. Reed was suspected of having a relationship with a white woman and hanged over the Sunflower River Bridge, Clarksdale, Mississippi\nThis article focuses on African Americans who were lynched after World War I. After young African-American men volunteered to fight against the Central Powers, during World War I, many of them returned home but instead of being rewarded for their military service, they were subjected to discrimination and racism by the citizens and the government. Labor shortages in essential industries caused a massive migration of southern African- Americans to northern cities leading to a wide-spread emergency of segregation in the north and the regeneration of the Ku Klux Klan. For many African-American veterans, as well as the majority of the African-Americans in the United States, the times which followed the war were fraught with challenges similar to those they faced overseas. Discrimination and segregation were at the forefront of everyday life, but most prevalent in schools, public revenues, and housing. Although members of different races who had fought in World War I believed that military service was a price which was worth paying in exchange for equal citizenship, this was not the case for African Americans. The decades which followed World War I included blatant acts of racism and nationally recognized events which conveyed American society's portrayal of African-Americans as 2nd class citizens. Although the United States had just won The Great War  in 1918, the national fight for equal rights was just beginning.\n\n## Background  \n### World War I  \nWorld War I began with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914 and it ended with the signing of the Armistice of November 11, 1918. Though the fighting stopped, the war's potential to resume still existed and peace was only reached when representatives of Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany after Germany resumed its submarine attacks on merchant and passenger ships. When the United States sent men to the fronts of Europe, the United States Armed Forces remained segregated, with all-black and all-white units. Despite the segregation and the mistreatment which they were constantly being subjected to by everyday society, many African Americans volunteered to join the Allied war effort. By the time of the signing of the armistice with Germany, more than 350,000 African Americans had joined the military and served with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front. Around 50,000 of those 350,000 experienced combat and a total of 770 African-Americans who fought for their country paid with their lives. On top of that, during the course of World War 1, over 400,000 black citizens who were searching for defense jobs migrated from the rural south to the urban north in order to fill the need for laborers which existed in essential industries. Although this provided new opportunities for many African American, it would go on to encourage widespread segregation and discrimination in the north after the war was over.  \n### Reaction to returning veterans  \nHistorically, when a war is over, those who served are lauded for their heroism and patriotism. However, that has not always been the case for American soldiers of African descent. African American soldiers who served in World War 1 were treated worse before, during, and after the war than any other group of American soldiers.  \nDuring a homecoming celebration for African-American veterans of World War I in Norfolk, Virginia a race riot broke out on July 21, 1919. At least two people were killed and three others were injured. City officials had to call in the Marines and Navy personnel to restore order.  \nOn August 16, 1917, Senator James K. Vardaman of Mississippi spoke of his fear of black veterans returning to the South, as he viewed that it would \"inevitably lead to disaster.\" To the American South, the use of black soldiers in the military was a threat, not a virtue. \"Impress the negro with the fact that he is defending the flag, inflate his untutored soul with military airs, teach him that it is his duty to keep the emblem of the Nation flying triumphantly in the air,\" and, the senator cautioned, \"it is but a short step to the conclusion that his political rights must be respected.\"  \nOften violence broke out between serving members of the military. In both the Bisbee Riot (July 3, 1919) and the New London riots of 1919 active African-American service members were attacked by white mobs or white military units.  \nMany black soldiers in the years after the war were threatened with violence if they were caught wearing their uniform. Many others were even physically attacked, sometimes barely escaping with their lives. During an April 5, 1919, market day in Sylvester, Georgia, black veteran Daniel Mack was walking through a busy street and brushed against a white man. The white man was offended that Mack did not show the proper amount of respect and the two got in a scuffle; police came on the scene and promptly arrested Mack for assault. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison. A few days into his sentence, on April 14, a white mob broke into the prison, took him out into the wilderness and lynched Mack; he survived by playing dead. No arrests were ever made. Elisha Harper, 25 years old, was the son of the Rev. T. F. Harper, a respectable and \"well-behaved preacher\" living in Helena. He fought in the army during World War I and just returned from Europe. On July 24, 1919, while walking the streets of Newberry, South Carolina, he allegedly insulted a 14-year-old girl, who promptly reported him to the authorities. Harper was arrested and thrown in jail. Soon a white mob had gathered and would have lynched Harper if it was not for the local Sheriff who hid him away.  \nMilitary service provided by African-Americans overseas and at home made little difference in citizenship for African-Americans. American society still perceived African Americans the same after the war as they did before the war.  \n## Lynched African-American veterans  \nThe following is an incomplete list of African Americans who had served in the military during WWI and were killed by white mobs with no trials for alleged crimes. Lynching is embedded deep in America's racial psyche. By 1919, lynching had developed into a programmatic ritual of torture and empowerment to the white race. The accurate number of African American veterans lynched in military uniform is unknown, but there were several cases of beatings and lynchings for the refusal to remove a military uniform, most notably the lynching of Wilbur Little in the spring of 1919. Apparent from the table, the vast majority of lynchings took place in the southeast region of the United States. The three states with the largest number of African American lynchings from 1850 - 1929 were Georgia, Mississippi and Texas.  \n## Contrast to White Veterans  \nThe return home was not perfect for any one group of people leading to the development of the Bonus Armys and many other displays of displeasement. A majority of World War I veterans believed that they had not been compensated enough for their service and they should have been taken better care of, especially in hospitals. However, there was still a major contrast in the treatment received from white and black veterans after World War 1, leading to public unrest and loss of life.  \nWhite veterans received far more recognition from a national level for their bravery and sacrifice in the war. This included radio appearances, national headlines, and statues honoring their sacrifice. The population of the United states in 1919 was over 85% white and almost all major media organizations were run by white males leading to a disparity in the media attention for the entire African-American population. A monopolized media industry and racial prejudice from white Americans led to the unwillingness to consistently recognize the efforts and sacrifices of African-American veterans. In fact, out of the nearly 400,000 African Americans who served in World War I not one was rewarded with the Congressional Medal of Honor until 1991.  \nWhen veterans came back home, there were various victory parades thrown in their honor in major cities. However, because segregation was still in place there were separate parades thrown for African-American soldiers at a smaller scale. During these parades there would be several examples of civil unrest, most notable during a victory parade in Norfolk, Virginia a race riot broke out on July 21, 1919. It was not just notoriety and praise that African-American veterans were lacking. The greatest gap between white and black veterans could be seen when examining financial stability and socioeconomic status. On average, white Americans had far more resources and privileges to live at a higher quality of life.  \n## Aftermath  \nThese lynchings were among several incidents of civil unrest that are now known as the American Red Summer of 1919. Attacks on black communities and white oppression spread to more than three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine massacre in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 blacks and 5 whites were killed. Other major events of Red Summer were the Chicago race riot and Washington D.C. race riot, which caused 38 and 39 deaths, respectively. Both riots had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.  \nAfrican-Americans were not only plagued with racism upon return but the rising flu pandemic of 1918 as well. Due to the statically lower socioeconomic status held by many African-Americans they were more likely to contract the flu and once contracted they were worse off fighting it. Therefore, the flu pandemic devastated the African- American community and left their overall health and financial well being in shambles. This would then cause African American World War 1 veterans to communicate directly with policymakers and bureaucrats to push professional and public health advancement in the 1920s and 1930s for all black Americans.  \nPrior to World War I, most African Americans did not challenge the racial status quo. However, these events and unequal treatment following World War I did lead to a spark in the African American community. Following the war, emboldened by their military service and their support of the war at home through defense jobs, African Americans were determined to fight for equality. Racism and segregation are issues which plagued the African-American community for too long and they were now willing to fight against it. In fact, during the war the African American community hosted protests against segregation and discrimination, but lacked the ignition to cause real change. This change would be called the \"New Negro Movement\" and could be described as the radical political movement toward civil rights following World War I. Emphasized in W. E. B. Du Bois's May 1919 Crisis editorial, \"Returning Soldiers,\" in which he famously proclaimed, \"We return. We return from fighting. We return fighting.\" . The combination of the New Negro Movement and the Harlem Renaissance allowed African American intellectuals to secure social equality through literature. This allowed major groups, such as the NAACP, to lobby for bills which pursued equality for African Americans. Most notable was the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, intended to prevent lynchings in the United States, but did not pass.  \nAlthough, post World War 1 could be defined as the spark that initiated the fight against the status quo and the emergence of the New Negro Movement. The fight for equality and civil rights in the United States would become a centuries-long battle which is still taking place today. Due to this reason, similar racial violence and lynchings occurred again after African-American troops returned from service in World War 2 and African American veterans of the Cold War\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts soldiers who were awarded the Croix de guerre for their gallantry in action during World War I?\nChoice list: \nA.

Most commercial trailers have built-in ramps for loading and off-loading cars, as well as power hydraulics to raise and lower ramps for stand-alone accessibility.\n\n## Small car trailers  \n## Commercial car carrier trailers  \n<ImageHere>Some of the hydraulic ramp controls on a car carrier trailer.\nLoading a trailer  \nChinese car transporter. Notice the long length and the double-parked upper deck of cars.  \nCommercial-size car carrying trailers are commonly used to ship new cars from the manufacturer to auto dealerships. In the United  States, shipping of used vehicles is also a big industry, employed by car owners who are relocating and choose to ship their cars instead of driving, as well as consumers who have just purchased a vehicle on the second-hand market (particularly online) and need it delivered to their location.  \nLike other semi-trailers, most commercial car carrier trailers attach to the tractor using a fifth wheel coupling. Trailers can either be enclosed, possessing walls like a conventional box trailer, which affords the shipped vehicles more protection at the cost of lower capacity; or open, as in the commonly seen skeletal tube steel design, which exposes the vehicles to the elements but allows for greater carrying capacity. An American commercial car carrier typically fits between 5 and 9 cars,  \ndepending on the car size and trailer model (capacity is limited by an 80,000\u00a0lb weight cap that a road vehicle is subject to under U.S. law.). Significantly higher-capacity vehicles have been observed around the world, such as a side-by-side loading Chinese model.  \nOpen commercial car carrier trailers typically have a double-decker design, with both decks subdivided into a number of loading and storage ramps that can be tilted and lifted independently of one another with hydraulics. Unlike flatbed tow trucks, which often need to transport non-running vehicles, car carrier trailers are not equipped with loaders or winches, instead, relying on the vehicles to be loaded under their own power. The trailer hydraulics allow the ramps to be aligned on a slope, so cars can be driven up and secured to the ramp floor with chains, tie-down ratchets, or wheel straps, after which the ramp can be tilted in any direction to optimize stacking.  \nTo load vehicles on the top deck of a double-decker commercial trailer, the rear half of the deck can tilt and be lowered hydraulically, forming a drive-up ramp to the upper deck. The top deck is usually loaded first and off-loaded last since the presence of cars on the lower deck can make it impossible to lower the top deck ramp.  \nTrailer hydraulics are operated using a control box mounted on the trailer itself.\n\n## Other equipment  \nIn order to further expand storage capacity, some trucks, typically called stinger units, are equipped with an \"overhead\" \u2014 an extra storage space mounted above the truck cabin which is accessible via the top ramp of a car carrier trailer. Up to 3 vehicles can be loaded on the truck: one on the roof, and two over the 5th wheel/drive tires.\n\nQuestion: Which component is essential for the operation of a car carrier trailer as described in the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)  \nThe Crucifix by Cimabue at Santa Croce (1265) is a very large wooden crucifix, painted in distemper, attributed to the Florentine painter and mosaicist Cimabue, one of two large crucifixes attributed to him. The work was commissioned by the Franciscan friars of Santa Croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards. It is one of the first Italian artworks to break from the late medieval Byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and humanistic iconography.  \nThe gilding and monumentality of the cross link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is reflective of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Vel\u00e1zquez to Francis Bacon.  \nThe work has been in the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence since the late thirteenth century, and at the Museo dell'Opera Santa Croce since restoration following flooding of the Arno in 1966. It remains in poor condition despite conservation efforts.  \n## Commission  \nBoth of Cimabue's surviving crucifixes were commissioned by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views had a profound effect on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.  \nThe church at Santa Croce was the third that the Franciscans constructed at the site. The first was begun in 1295, and is where Cimabue's Crucifix probably hung, given its large size, above the rood screen. It was later positioned at the north transept, in the sacristy and by the entrance on the southern flank.  \n## Description  \nCimabue achieves a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches tended to be extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.  \n### Crucifixion  \n<ImageHere>Cimabue's Arezzo crucifix, c. 1268\u20131271. This is the earlier of the two extant crucifixes attributed to him.\nCompared to earlier works of this type, Christ's body is more physically corporeal, depicted as a real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both his body and semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above the level of the cross.  \nHis body arches, forcing his torso to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds in his hands as his head falls to the side from fatigue and the physical reality of approaching death. His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers his thighs and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the Arezzo work, may be influenced by earlier crucifixions by Giunta Pisano. His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan Meditation on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; \"Turn your eyes away from His divinity for a little while and consider Him purely as a man\".\n<ImageHere>Giunta Pisano, Crucifix, tempera on wood, 1240s. Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi\nHis eyes are open, and his skin is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or timeless sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, was known as the Christus triumphans (\"Triumphant Christ\"), and for contemporary\u00a0\u2013 especially Franciscan\u00a0\u2013 taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens (\"Suffering Christ\") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.  \nThe work surpasses Cimabue's c. 1268 Arezzo crucifix in several ways. It is more human and less reliant on idealised facial types, and the anatomy is more convincing. Christ's face is longer and narrower, and his nose less idealised. These features, according to art historian Robert Gibbs, give him \"a coarser but more personal expression\". A similar approach is taken with the cloth in the background of the cross itself, which although highly ornamented, lacks the lavish ornamentation of the equivalent cloth in the Arezzo cross.  \nHis head hangs in exhaustion, and his hands bleed from the puncture wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher above his head and strain to carry the weight of his body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.  \nThe painting contains elements typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But in other respects it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.\n\n### Saints  \nRepresentations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ in small rectangular panels at either end of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.  \nTheir cloaks are simpler and lack the lavish gilding of the Arezzo crucifixion. The Virgin wears a red dress. Her robe was originally blue, but has darkened.  \n## Carpentry  \nThe crucifix measures 448\u00a0cm x 390\u00a0cm and consists of five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.  \nIts dimensions are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably influenced by the geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the sway of Christ's body, altered the positioning of some of the boards on the lower half.  \n## Attribution  \nDue to lack of surviving documentation, it is difficult to attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicol\u00f2 Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.  \nRejecting these views, Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle in 1903 concluded that the Santa Croce crucifix \"in technical examination...makes some approach to the Florentine master, but it is rather of its time than by the master himself.\"  \n## 1966 damage and restoration  \nThe present state of the Crucifix, after flood damage and restoration.  \nThe crucifix was installed in the church of Santa Croce at the end of the thirteenth century. The church flooded in 1333 and 1557, but only experienced serious flood damage in 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. During the event thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed and the Crucifix lost 60% of its paint. By 1966 it was returned to display at the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it had been located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.  \nRescuing the cross from the flood of 1966  \nA team of restorers led by conservators Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza at the \"Laboratario del Restauro\" in Florence spent ten years reapplying paint. Utilising computer modelling, they worked in an almost pointillist manner. The tiny specks of pigment floating around the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the gesso and canvas to prevent buckling as the reapplied paint dried. The Crucifix was put back on public display in 1976. The restoration was covered by the international press.  \nSince restoration the work has been lent to galleries outside Italy, the first time it had left Florence since its creation. According to the critic Waldemar Januszczak, it was brought \"around the globe in a curious, post-restoration state\u2014part original artwork, part masterpiece of modern science... a thirteenth century\u2014twentieth-century hybrid.\"\n\nQuestion: Which crucifix painting represents the \"Christus triumphans\" style, characterized by an unblemished skin and open eyes, reflecting a less humanized and more divine portrayal of Christ?\nChoice list: \nA.

Purnell  \nRear Admiral William Reynolds Purnell (6 September 1886 \u2013 3 March 1955) was an officer in the United States Navy who served in World War I and World War II. A 1908 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he captained destroyers during World War I. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his role in protecting convoys against German submarines as commander of the  6.  \nHe was promoted to rear admiral in November 1941. During World War II, he was chief of staff of the ill-fated Asiatic Fleet at the start of the Pacific War. He later served as Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Materiel. He was the navy representative on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the navy representative on the Military Policy Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project.  Purnell helped coordinate its activities with those of the navy. In 1945, he travelled to Tinian as the representative of the Military Policy Committee, and coordinated preparations for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with senior army and navy commanders in the Pacific. He retired from the navy in 1946 and died in 1955.  \n## Early life  \nWilliam Reynolds Purnell was born in Bowling Green, Missouri, on 6 September 1886. In 1908, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was commissioned as an ensign in 1910. During World War I, he commanded the destroyers 6, 6, 6, and 6. For his services, he was awarded the Navy Cross. His citation read:  \nIn January 1917, while he was serving on the Rowan, he married Ada Dodge Curtiss, the daughter of Walter Phelps Dodge and the ex-wife of Gerald S. Curtiss. They had one son, William Reynolds Purnell, Jr.  \nAfter the war, he commanded the tanker 6 from 1934 to 1936. Alternating duty afloat with service ashore, he then became secretary to the General Board. He commanded the cruiser 6 from January to December 1939.  \n## World War II  \nPurnell became Chief of Staff of Admiral Thomas C. Hart's Asiatic Fleet. Purnell represented the United States at a planning conference in Singapore in April 1941 at which American, British, Dutch, Australian, and New Zealand commanders attempted to coordinate their plans for an increasingly likely war with Japan. He was promoted to rear admiral in November 1941. On 7 December, Purnell played golf with Hart. War broke out the next morning. The Japanese advanced quickly and the Asiatic Fleet moved from the Philippines to Java in January. As the Japanese closed in on Java, Purnell flew to Broome on 25 February.  \nIn Australia, Purnell became chief of staff to Vice Admiral William A. Glassford, the commander of US Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific. When Glassford departed in May 1942, Purnell took his place. He too left Australia in June 1942, for duty in Washington, D.C., in the Office of the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King. For his services, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Rear Admiral William Reynolds Purnell, United States Navy, for especially meritorious service as Chief of Staff to Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, and Commander U.S. Forces, Southwest, Pacific, since the outbreak of war for duties involving great responsibility connected with formulation plans, counseling their application and aid in directing execution, especially of offensive missions of forces of this command which have resulted in substantial damage to the enemy together with skill and tact displayed in negotiating, conferring and dealing with commanders of the Allied Forces during World War II.  \n<ImageHere>The \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\": Captain William S. Parsons (left), Rear Admiral William R. Purnell (center), and Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell (right)\nPurnell became Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Materiel. He was also the navy representative on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the navy representative on the Military Policy Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project. Purnell helped coordinate the activities of the Manhattan Project with those of the navy, particularly the navy's thermal diffusion research, and he helped provide scientists and technicians from the navy for the project.  \nIn February 1945, Purnell arranged for Commander Frederick Ashworth to go to Guam to brief Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz on the project. He provided Ashworth with a letter from King stressing the project's importance and the need for secrecy. Ashworth selected a base site for the Manhattan Project's operations. He inspected facilities on Guam and Tinian, and chose the latter.  \nTinian's harbor suffered from congestion due to extensive base development work, and ships sometimes took months to unload. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., went to Purnell, who arranged for an order from King to Nimitz stating that all shipments related to the Manhattan Project and the 509th Composite Group had to be unloaded immediately on arrival, regardless of the consequent disruption to the port's operations.\n<ImageHere>Purnell (center), General Carl Spaatz (second from right) and other dignitaries await the return of the Enola Gay and her crew from the mission to Hiroshima\nProblems like this underlined the value of having high-ranking officers on hand to deal with local commanders to make decisions on the spot if necessary. In drawing up an organization for command of the Manhattan Project's operations, Groves and Purnell agreed that Purnell should to be present on Tinian as both the representative of the Military Policy Committee and the personal representative of Admiral King. He was joined by Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, the Manhattan Project's Deputy for Operations, and the two shared responsibility for coordinating the Manhattan Project's activities with the senior army and navy commanders in the Pacific. Along with Captain William S. Parsons, the director of Project Alberta, they formed what became informally known as the \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\".  \nPurnell was the first proponent of the idea that two atomic attacks, one following quickly after the other, would be required to end the war. This was something that Groves and Purnell discussed a number of times. \"I knew that with him and Farrell on the ground at Tinian,\" Groves wrote. \"There would be no unnecessary delay in exploiting our success\" after the bombing of Hiroshima. The main difficulty with the second mission, then scheduled for 11 August, was the weather, which was predicted to be good until 9 August but bad for at least five days starting on 10 August. Parsons agreed to work the assembly team around the clock to get the Fat Man bomb ready by the evening of 8 August.  \nBefore Major Charles Sweeney took off on the mission, Purnell took him aside and asked him if he knew how much the bomb cost. Sweeney did not know; Purnell told him it was about $2 billion. He then asked if Sweeney knew how much his aircraft was worth. This Sweeney did know; over half a million dollars. Purnell then told him: \"I'd suggest you keep those relative values in mind for this mission.\"\n\n## Later life  \nAfter the war, Purnell served as a member of the Army-Navy Evaluation Board during Operation Crossroads. He retired from the navy in October 1946, and moved to Palo Alto, California, where he died on 5 March 1955. He was buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Ada Dodge Purnell, and his son, William R. Purnell, Jr.\n\nQuestion: Which individual played a significant role in coordinating the activities of the Manhattan Project with those of the navy and was present on Tinian as both the representative of the Military Policy Committee and the personal representative of Admiral King?\nChoice list: \nA.

The bezant\u00e9e bordure indicates a connection to the ancient Earls of Cornwall\nSir William Killigrew (died 1622) of Hanworth, Middlesex, was a courtier to Queen Elizabeth I and to her successor King James I, whom he served as Groom of the Privy Chamber. He served as a member of parliament at various times between 1571 and 1614 and was Chamberlain of the Exchequer between 1605 and 1608. Several of his descendants were also royal courtiers and many were buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\n## Origins  \nKilligrew was the fifth son of John III Killigrew (died 1567) of Arwenack, Cornwall, the first Governor of Pendennis Castle, situated on land within the Arwenack estate, appointed by King Henry VIII. His mother was Elizabeth Trewinnard, 2nd daughter of James Trewennard of Trewennard, in the parish of St Erth, Cornwall. The monumental brass of John III Killigrew survives in St Budock's Church, near Arwenack.  \n## Career  \n### Under Queen Elizabeth I  \nIn 1571 he was elected Member of Parliament for Grantham in Lincolnshire and in 1572 he was elected MP for Helston in Cornwall. He became feodary and escheator for the Duchy of Cornwall and Constable of Launceston Castle in 1576 by which year he was Groom of the Privy Chamber to Queen Elizabeth I. In 1578 he was farmer of the profits from seals in the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Common Pleas. He was commissioner for musters for Cornwall by 1582 and was a Justice of the Peace for Cornwall from 1583 to 1587. In 1584 he was elected MP for the Killigrew pocket borough of Penryn. He was receiver for Devon and Cornwall by 1588 and was commissioner for goods from Madre de Dios in 1592. In 1593 he was elected MP for Fowey in Cornwall. He was commissioner acting treasurer of the chamber in 1595 and commissioner for goods from Cadiz in 1596. In 1597 he was elected MP for the prestigious county seat, Cornwall.  \n### Under King James I  \nHe was knighted in 1603 on the succession of King James I. In 1604 he became MP for Liskeard. From 1605 to 1608 he was Chamberlain of the Exchequer. In 1614 he was elected MP for Penryn again.  \n## Marriage and progeny  \nAt some time about 1576 Killigrew married Margaret Saunders, daughter of Thomas Saunders of Uxbridge, Middlesex, and widow of Robert Woolman and of John Leigh. By his wife he had the following progeny:  \n<ImageHere>Catherine Killigrew (born 1579) (Lady Jermyn), at age 35, daughter of Sir William Killigrew and wife of Sir Thomas Jermyn (died 1645). 1614 Portrait by\nMarcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1561\u20131636), Yale Center for British Art, Connecticut  \n* Sir Robert Killigrew (1580\u20131633) of Hanworth, Middlesex, MP and Vice-Chamberlain to Queen Henrietta Maria.  \n* Elizabeth Killigrew, eldest daughter, wife of Sir Maurice Berkeley (c. 1577\u20131617), MP, of Bruton Abbey, Somerset.  \n* Catherine Killigrew (born 1579), wife of Sir Thomas Jermyn (died 1645) of Suffolk, MP, and mother of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of Saint Albans, KG, (1605\u20131684). Her portrait by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1561\u20131636) survives in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art, Connecticut, USA.\n\n## Landholdings  \nIn 1594 he obtained an 80-year lease of the two adjoining royal manors of Kempton and Hanworth in Middlesex. In 1631 his son Sir Robert Killigrew (1580\u20131633) secured the reversion and in 1651 the latter's son Sir William Killigrew (1606\u20131695), \"of Kempton Park\", conveyed Kempton to John Warburton.  \n## Death and burial  \nKilligrew died in 1622 and was buried in St. Margaret's Church, Lothbury, in the City of London, near his brother Henry Killigrew.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following individuals served as a member of parliament at various times between 1571 and 1614 and was Chamberlain of the Exchequer between 1605 and 1608?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\n<ImageHere>alt=Bobby Heenan (front), a Caucasian man in a black sequin jacket, leads Andr\u00e9 the Giant to the ring\nAfter a leave of absence and a stint as competing as part of The Machines tag team stable, Andr\u00e9 returned to the WWF. The WWF began advertising Andr\u00e9, once again as a face, as an opponent of either Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage, or as a tag-team partner of Hogan to face Savage and The Honky Tonk Man. However, Rick Steamboat competed instead in Andr\u00e9's place, with no official explanation given for Andr\u00e9's absence. Andr\u00e9 did make an appearance at a televised show at Madison Square Garden, getting into the ring after Hogan had won a match; Andr\u00e9 simply picked up the WWF World Heavyweight Championship belt, looked at it, and gave it back to a bewildered Hogan before leaving ringside. Announcers Gorilla Monsoon and Gene Okerlund thought Andr\u00e9's unannounced appearance was strange but didn't think anything more of it.  \nThings began happening on an edition of Piper's Pit in 1987. First, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years; Andr\u00e9 came out to congratulate him, but later Hogan remarked how Andr\u00e9's handshake felt a little too firm. On the following week's Piper's Pit, Andr\u00e9 was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being \"the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history.\"  WWF billed him as having been undefeated for 15 years, despite having lost several matches via countout and disqualification. Hogan came out to congratulate Andr\u00e9 but spoke mostly of himself, causing Andr\u00e9 to walk out in the midst of Hogan's speech. A meeting between Andr\u00e9 and Hogan was scheduled to take place the next week on Piper's Pit (February 7, 1987).  \nWhen Andr\u00e9 came out he was accompanied by Bobby Heenan. Heenan accused Hogan of being Andr\u00e9's friend only so he would not have to defend the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against him. Hogan disputed this, but Andr\u00e9 challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania III. Heenan, following Hogan's apparent disbelief, stated \"You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this, Hogan\" followed by Andr\u00e9 ripping off Hogan's shirt and crucifix, with the crucifix causing Hogan's chest to bleed.  \nOn a \u201cPiper\u2019s Pit\u201d segment aired a week later, Hogan reflected on his friendship with Andre and how he felt betrayed when he was now with Heenan. Piper asked Hogan point-blank whether he would face Andre at WrestleMania, to which Hogan responded with an emphatic \u201cYES!\u201d The friendship angle continued to be emphasized at a contract signing (aired several weeks later), where Hogan angrily accused Andre of betraying their friendship; Heenan pressed on with his claims that Hogan used their friendship to duck a title match, while Andre claimed he purposely held back on some of his teachings to Hogan before predicting victory.  \nDuring the March 14 (taped February 21) edition of Saturday Night's Main Event X at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, both were participants in a 20-man Battle royal. Although neither won, Andr\u00e9 stated he gained a psychological advantage over Hogan, due to eliminating him from the contest. Andr\u00e9 also was billed as a corner man for several of Hogan's opponents, almost always members of the Heenan Family, at a few untelevised house shows prior to WrestleMania III.  \nAt WrestleMania III, Andr\u00e9's was billed at abbr=on, and the stress of such immense weight on his bones and joints resulted in constant pain, causing him to wear a brace underneath his wrestling singlet. Hogan won the match after body-slamming Andr\u00e9 (later dubbed \"the bodyslam heard around the world\"), followed by Hogan's running leg drop finisher. This was billed as the first time Hogan slammed Andr\u00e9, despite having done it multiple times in 1980. Andr\u00e9 had also been slammed previously by Harley Race, El Canek and Stan Hansen, among others.  \nFollowing the match, Andr\u00e9 took a leave of absence while Hogan concentrated on title defenses against Race, Hercules, Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage, the One Man Gang and Killer Khan, among others.\n\n### Feud continued (1987\u20131988)  \nIn May 1987, on Saturday Night's Main Event XI, Heenan and Andre gave an interview with Gene Okerlund.  During the interview Heenan and Andre claimed \u2013 by virtue of a bodyslam attempt by Hogan about a minute into the match, wherein Andre fell on top and (by Heenan's claim) the referee completed the three count \u2013\u00a0they were cheated by the referee and that Andre was the rightful champion and still undefeated.  Heenan demanded an investigation and a subsequent rematch if the WWF wouldn't strip Hogan of the championship.  \nAt the inaugural Survivor Series event Andr\u00e9 and Hogan were named as captains of their respective teams. After earlier confronting each other in the ring early in the match, the two finally met midway through the match, battling for approximately one minute with Hogan dominating Andr\u00e9; however, just as Hogan was about to knock Andr\u00e9 from the ring, heel wrestlers King Kong Bundy and the One Man Gang interfered from outside the ring and caused Hogan to be counted out. Andr\u00e9 went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning Bam Bam Bigelow. After the match Hogan returned to the ring and attacked Andr\u00e9, knocking him out of the ring.  \nHogan defended his title against Bundy on Saturday Night's Main Event XIII.  Andre was in Bundy's corner and interfered in the match.  \nThe referee stopped the match and ejected Andre from ringside.  Andre was irate but obliged with the request in order to prevent Bundy from being disqualified.  Bundy would go on to win the match via a count-out and demanded a rematch with Andre in his corner.  \nAfter Hogan won a rematch against Bundy on Saturday Night's Main Event XIV which aired January 2, 1988 (taped December 7, 1987), Andr\u00e9 snuck up to get revenge on Hogan, choking him from behind until he was virtually unconscious, not letting go even after seven face-aligned wrestlers came to the ring to try to pull Andre away; it was only after Hacksaw Jim Duggan broke a 2x4 over Andr\u00e9's back (which Andre no-sold) that gave the faces the opening they needed to pull Hogan to safety.  \nIn the meantime, Hogan was busy defending his title against the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, which started when Hogan refused to sell the title to DiBiase. Hogan won every one of their matchups (often by disqualification), and a frustrated DiBiase turned to Andr\u00e9 to win the title for him. This, plus the Survivor Series match and Andre's attack of Hogan, were the pieces used to create interest in a Hogan-Andr\u00e9 rematch, set for The Main Event I, which aired live on February 5, 1988, on NBC. An in-ring contract signing was staged at the first Royal Rumble, aired January 24, 1988, where DiBiase promoted Andr\u00e9 to \"give your stamp of approval\" by grabbing Hogan, slamming his head into the table and then tipping the table on top of him before leaving the ring. The next evening, at a televised house show at Madison Square Garden, Andr\u00e9 was the cornerman for DiBiase and his bodyguard, Virgil, in the latter two wrestlers' tag-team match against Hogan and Bam Bam Bigelow; despite multiple times where Andr\u00e9 interfered, Hogan and Bigelow rallied for the win.  \n#### Hogan vs. Andre II (The Main Event)  \nAt The Main Event, Andr\u00e9 won the match and WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan, even though Hogan's shoulders were not on the mat during the entire three-count; the referee was distracted by Virgil during Hogan's pinfall attempt of Andr\u00e9 immediately before, setting up the finish.  Immediately after winning, whilst still inside the ring and interviewed by Gene Okerlund, Andr\u00e9 publicly contractually surrendered the title to DiBiase, however the transaction was subsequently declared invalid by then-WWF president Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant. The broadcast was seen by 33 million people.  \n(Following the match it was revealed that appointed referee Dave Hebner was \"detained backstage\", and Hogan during his post match interview accused DiBiase of paying someone to get plastic surgery to look like Dave. It was revealed to have been Dave's twin brother, Earl Hebner.)  \n#### Hogan vs. Andre III (WrestleMania IV)  \nA 14-wrestler tournament was set up WrestleMania IV, for the winner to claim the vacant WWF World Championship; as part of the tournament, Hogan and Andr\u00e9 were given first-round byes and would automatically wrestle in the quarter-finals. In the meantime, Hogan and Andr\u00e9 battled on opposing sides of tag-team matchups, Hogan often paired with either Bigelow or Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Andr\u00e9 with DiBiase, with Hogan's team always victorious.  \nAt WrestleMania, Andr\u00e9 and Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match. In the end, Hogan's friend \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage won the title, defeating DiBiase in the finals. The Hogan-Andr\u00e9 feud then simmered when Hogan took a leave of absence during the spring and early summer of 1988 (to film the movie No Holds Barred) while Andr\u00e9 feuded with Duggan.  \n#### Wind down of feud  \nInterest in a possible resumption of the feud came in the summer of 1988 when Savage began issuing an open challenge for the WWF World Championship, leading to a two-on-one attack by Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase. Savage recovered and the next week declared he and Hogan would face Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase at the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at Madison Square Garden.  \n<ImageHere>Hulk Hogan pictured in March 7, 1989 at the El Paso Civic Center for a WWF \"Superstars of Wrestling\" event. (He would fight Big Boss Man this night while Andr\u00e9 the Giant faced Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.)\nAndr\u00e9 and Hogan fought in a steel cage match held at WrestleFest on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee, which Hogan won (after knocking Andr\u00e9 from the cage and causing him to be tied in the ring ropes). In the main event match at SummerSlam, Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase (calling themselves The Mega Bucks) seemed to have a psychological advantage over Hogan and Savage (known as The Mega Powers) as the heel-aligned Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was the special guest referee. However, the Mega Powers won, thus ending the Andre-Hogan rivalry. Andr\u00e9's next feud would be with Jake Roberts, and Hogan's would be (along with Savage) with the Big Boss Man and Akeem (The Twin Towers).  \nAndre and Hogan met one more time in their careers, that coming in March 1990, shortly before WrestleMania VI when Hogan teamed with the now-face Big Boss Man to defeat Andre and Haku (who were teaming as The Colossal Connection); the Colossal Connection were tag team champions but this was a non-title match.\n\n## Kayfabe  \nIn real life, Andre and Hogan were friends. A picture even exists of Andre attending Hogan's wedding to his first wife, Linda.\n\nQuestion: At WrestleMania III, what iconic wrestling move did Hulk Hogan perform on Andr\u00e9 the Giant?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nPorto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul province, seven years after the end of the Ragamuffin War\nOn 20 September 1835, a civil war that became known as the Ragamuffin War erupted in Rio Grande do Sul. The rebels, called Ragamuffins, conquered most of the province, including its capital, Porto Alegre. On 15 June 1836, Major Manuel Marques de Sousa (a loyalist officer, later made Count of Porto Alegre) retook Porto Alegre by surprise. Both soldiers and civilians participated in the town's recapture, and among these was the 18-year-old Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds. Marques de Sousa handed over the command of the loyalist forces to Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds' elderly grandfather, Army Marshal Jo\u00e3o de Deus Mena Barreto, the town's highest-ranking officer. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds joined the army as 1st Cadet in the 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry.  \nJos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds fought in small battles on 30 June and 20 July against Ragamuffins forces besieging Porto Alegre, and he saw action again on 6 September near the town of Capela Grande (today's Viam\u00e3o). In 1837, he fought in further engagements: on 10 January near the town of Rio Pardo and on 25 June and 29 September near Porto Alegre. He was promoted to alferes (modern-day second lieutenant) on 28 August 1838. On 2 December 1839, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was transferred from the 2nd Regiment to the 3rd Regiment of Light Cavalry and raised to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant).  \nThe imperial forces slowly regained ground, and by the early 1840s, the Ragamuffins were on the run. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was promoted to brevet (acting) captain on 7 May 1842, and this commission was made permanent on 23 July 1844. After the war ended in March 1845, he was transferred to the 5th brigade and raised to major. On 23 December, he was moved to the 3rd brigade.\n\n### Platine War  \nIn the years that followed, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds remained in the 3rd brigade. He was given a leave from 8 January 1848 until 8 May. He was next appointed to a bureaucratic position charged with administrative duties for the 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry on 23 May. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds received a promotion to brevet major on 30 August 1849. In January 1850, he marched to Bag\u00e9, and later to Quaraim, to maintain order after a series of disturbances broke out in those regions. Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay (former Cisplatina) and dissident Argentine provinces. A Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The 4th Regiment was of Light Cavalry part of this expedition, serving under the 1st Division. The Brazilians were victorious, and Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was rewarded with confirmation in the rank of major on 19 June 1852.  \nOn 15 July 1854, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was promoted to lieutenant colonel and transferred to the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which served as Emperor Dom Pedro\u00a0II's personal guard in the national capital, Rio de Janeiro. He became the regiment's interim commander from 22 February 1855 until 1 August. Upon leaving that position, he was praised by the Emperor for his organizing and leadership skills as head of the unit. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds requested permission to study in the Military College and take its cavalry course, but in February 1856, his request was declined. It was considered inappropriate to have a lieutenant colonel studying among cadets. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was promoted to colonel on 2 December, receiving the command of the 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry, and was stationed to Rio Grande do Sul. On 14 March 1858, he was assigned command over the Jaguar\u00e3o frontier (a military district in Rio Grande do Sul). On 3 July 1860, he was transferred to the command of the S\u00e3o Borja frontier, where he remained until 1862.  \n## Southern wars  \n### Invasion of Uruguay  \n<ImageHere>A church heavily damaged during the siege of Paysand\u00fa, 1865\nOn 15 February 1864, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was given a four months leave to treat his health. He returned to active duty and was raised to the rank of brigadier on 29 July. A few months later, in October, he received orders to invade Uruguay at the head of a brigade composed of one infantry battalion and two cavalry corps. Another civil war had erupted in Uruguay between its Blanco Party and Colorado Party. The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. The Brazilian government decided to intervene and mobilized an army. Brazil expected Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds' small force to begin operations while its main army was being brought up to full strength.  \nJos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds' brigade began its advance on 12 October 1864. Two days later, near the Brazilian town of Jaguar\u00e3o, the force invaded Uruguay's Cerro Largo Department. The Blancos attacked the Brazilian force during its march in several skirmishes, but was unable to prevent its progress. On 16 October, the brigade entered Melo unopposed. The town was the capital of Cerro Largo and had been abandoned by the Blancos. The brigade withdrew to rendezvous with the main army on 24 October, after handing over control of Melo to the Uruguayan Colorados. A few days previously, on 20 October, Brazil's Vice-Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then-Baron of Tamandar\u00e9) had formed a secret anti-Blancos alliance with Uruguay's Brigadier General Venancio Flores, leader of the Colorados.  \nOn 1 November 1864, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was appointed commander of the 2nd Division in the main Brazilian army, which by then was called the \"Army of the South\" and led by his uncle Field Marshal Jo\u00e3o Prop\u00edcio Mena Barreto (later Baron of S\u00e3o Gabriel). The Army of the South invaded Uruguay on 1 December. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds took part in the siege of the Uruguayan town of Paysand\u00fa, which fell on 2 January 1865. The Brazilian army and the allied Colorados force then besieged the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo. Before any attack upon the city could be launched, the Blancos capitulated, ending the conflict.\n\n### War against Paraguay  \nThe Battle of Potrero Sauce, 18 July 1866  \nAn unintended consequence of the attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyut\u00ed on 24 May. At Tuyut\u00ed Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars that made him look like he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.  \nJos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds later fought in the Battle of Boquer\u00f3n and the Battle of Potrero Sauce on 16 and 18 July 1866, respectively. He was transferred to the 1st cavalry division on 19 January 1867. He fought in the Battle of Tuy\u00fa Cu\u00e9 on 31 July, in the Battle of San Solano and in the Battle of Par\u00e9-Cu\u00e9 (part of the operations to encircle the Humait\u00e1 fortress) on 3 October. He was moved from the 1st cavalry division to the 3rd cavalry division on 12 October. He participated in the 28 Oct. 1867 Battle of Potrero Obella.  He also fought in the Second Battle of Tuyut\u00ed on 3 November. After the fall of Humait\u00e1 in July 1868, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds took part in the Pikysyry maneuver that resulted in the Dezembrada (Deed of December), a series of decisive victories over the Paraguayans. At the head of the 2nd army corps after 6 December, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds fought in the Battle of Avay, in the Battle of Lomas Valentinas and in the Battle of Angostura.  \nDespite his having fought and gained victories in many battles from the war's outset, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was not awarded with any promotion or title of nobility, except for receiving a few, minor chivalric orders. The Brazilian Commander-in-chief, Army Marshal Lu\u00eds Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Marquis of Caxias), had a very low opinion of Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds and considered him an incompetent officer. Caxias' view was not shared by other general officers, many of whom openly supported Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds and praised him as a capable field commander. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds fared better under Caxias' successor, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, who held him in high regard. During the last stage of the war, in which he commanded the 1st army corps, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds fought in the Battle of Piribebuy and in the Battle of Acosta \u00d1u in August 1869.  \n## Later years and death  \nOn 10 April 1871, more than a year after the Paraguayan ended, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was promoted to field marshal (present-day divisional general), the third-highest rank in the Brazilian army (below lieutenant general and army marshal). He was appointed on 24 April 1872 to the bureaucratic position of inspector of army units stationed in the provinces of S\u00e3o Paulo, Santa Catarina and Esp\u00edrito Santo. On 27 August, he became the inspector of the army units in Rio Grande do Sul. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds remained in that position until 4 May 1878, when he was named military commander of Rio Grande do Sul, a highly prestigious post.  \nIt is known that Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was also a member of the Liberal Party. It was common during the Empire of Brazil for high-ranking military officers to pursue political careers while on active duty. Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was first married to his cousin Maria Francisca Mena Barreto. After her death, he married Rita de C\u00e1ssia de Oliveira Melo, with whom he had daughters and one son, Jo\u00e3o de Deus Mena Barreto (who as divisional general would play a key role in the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that led to the rise of Dictator Get\u00falio Vargas).  \nJos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds died in Porto Alegre on 10 October 1879, while still serving as military commander over his native province. He was given solemn funereal honors. Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, Viscount of Taunay said that Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds \"had much bravery, beyond competence in arms\" and was a good tactician who remained unshakably calm in battles. Historian Gustavo Barroso regarded him a valorous and brave officer, the member of the Mena Barreto family who had most distinguished himself through his own merits.  \n## Honors  \n### Non-titled nobility honors  \n* Commander of the Brazilian Order of Christ.  \n* Commander of the Brazilian Order of the Rose.  \n* Dignitary of the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross.  \n* Commander of the Brazilian Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz.  \n### Military honors  \n* Medal of the army in the Oriental State of Uruguay in 1852.  \n* Medal of Paysand\u00fa.  \n* Commemorative medal of the surrender of the division of the army of Paraguay that occupied the village of Uruguaiana.  \n* Medal (oval) of merit \"due to military bravery\" (1868).  \n* Medal awarded to the army, armada and to civil servants in operations in the Paraguayan War (1870).\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a location that Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds was directly involved with during a military conflict?\nChoice list: \nA.

He graduated from the Baku High Army Commanders School in 1980 as an artillery officer before serving for five years in the Soviet Armed Forces Units in East Germany. Afterwards, he spent the next eight years at the Altay military registration and enlistment office of the Siberian Military District as part of the Ministry of Defence of the USSR.  \n## Political career  \n<ImageHere>Hasanov (right) and Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu (left) during the opening ceremony of the Sea Cup competition of the International Army Games.\nFollowing the fall of the Soviet Union, he served for a decade in the Border Troops of the Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan. He was then promoted to the chief of office of international relations of the State Border Service before being appointed Deputy Minister of Interior and Commander of the Internal Troops by a presidential decree on 17 January 2003, when he was also promoted to the rank of major-general four months later.\n<ImageHere>Hasanov (far left) during a military parade in honor of the Day of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan in 2018.\nHe was previously the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs.\n\n### Defence Minister  \n#### Karabakh Conflict  \nUpon coming into office as the Minister of Defence, he made statements in regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This included saying that the Azerbaijani army was strong and disciplined as opposed to that of Armenia and that \"the situation in the Armenian armed forces is disastrous. In case of war the troops of this country will escape from the field of battle.\" He also told the European Union that his country would support liberating its lands peacefully but he emphasized that Azerbaijan reserves the right to liberate \"its occupied lands\". This came at the same time as E.U. Special Representative for the South Caucasus Philippe Lefort congratulated him on his appointment.  \nDuring the 2016 April War, Hasanov stated that if shelling of Azerbaijani settlements by Armenian forces did not cease, Azerbaijan would consider launching an artillery bombardment on Stepanakert. In April 2019, Hasanov warned that \"If Armenians go on the offensive, it will give me the opportunity to meet with him Armenian Defence Minister David Tonoyan in Yerevan\", implying an armed incursion.  \n#### Representative functions  \nIn October 2017, a garrison military parade of the Nakhchivan Garrison was held through the capital of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in honor of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the first military unit of the National Army, being attended by Defense Minister Hasanov on behalf of the national government. He commanded the Day of the Armed Forces and Liberation Day parades on Azadliq Square in June and September 2018, with the latter commemorating the centennial of the Battle of Baku. Hasanov represented Azerbaijan at the 2019 Pakistan Day Parade in Islamabad. On 2 July 2019, on the instruction of President Aliyev, a delegation led by Hasanov visited Kima Davidovich (the mother of Belarusian-Azerbaijani soldier Anatoly Nikolayevich Davidovich) while she was being treated in a clinical hospital in Minsk, on the eve of his attendance at the celebrations in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Minsk Offensive.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\n be necessary.  \n### High-speed Internet  \nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai.  \nAfter thinking for a year, President Donald Trump came out against having nationalized fifth-generation wireless internet infrastructure (5G). Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai said this sent an \"important signal\" to private companies that were investing billions of dollars in 5G. Pai also proposed spending $20.4 billion over a decade on rural broadband Internet services. Since November 2018, the FCC has been auctioning megahertz of spectrum to commercial wireless internet service providers offering 5G connectivity. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said this was a step in the right direction and suggested that the Commission should not leave out \"mid-band\" spectrum lest the U.S. falls behind other countries. While previous generations of wireless internet offer the ability to send texts, static images, voice, and video through the Internet, 5G is considerably faster, allowing for high-quality video streaming, driverless cars, automated ports, remotely-controlled industrial robots, among other things. South Korea and the United States won the global 5G race when they began rolling out their services in early April 2019. Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Corp, Sprint Corp, and T Mobile US Inc have already begun implementing 5G equipment in a number of American cities with plans to gradually expand service as 5G-compatible phones become more widely available. However, a combination of the high capital costs and high debt levels of leading U.S. telecommunications firm could result in a slow deployment of 5G networks, allowing subsidized Chinese equipment to penetrate markets in Asia and Europe.  \nPresident Trump made the above announcement as he was considering banning Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from the U.S. market. His administration had already been discouraging U.S. allies from purchasing Huawei's 5G technology out of security concerns. His administration believed that Huawei equipment puts intelligence sharing at risk. Since March 2018, the FCC has considered barring the use of federal funds to purchase equipment from companies that could pose a threat to national security. By law, companies operating on Chinese soil must \"support, cooperate with and collaborate in national intelligence work.\"  \nFounded in 1987, Huawei has since become a leading telecommunications firm, spending 14% of its revenue on research and development each year between 2016 and 2018. However, it has been mired in multiple controversies involving alleged intellectual property theft and espionage. After an 11-month investigation, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee found in 2012 that Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese firm, were threats to national security and recommended that U.S. companies refrain from doing business with them.  Under Donald Trump, the U.S. government has been trying to dissuade companies and other governments from around the world from using Huawei's technologies. In May 2019, the Trump administration added Huawei to the \"entity list,\" which prevents it from acquiring technology from American firms without approval from the U.S. government. In October 2019, President Trump met with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto, to discuss alternatives to 5G technology from Huawei. Finland's technology giant Nokia has developed some 5G capabilities of its own, and is one of Huawei's chief competitors, alongside Sweden's Ericsson. In December 2017, telecommunications firms from around the world agreed upon a set of global standards for 5G so that the technology can be easily implemented. The race was on for the various equipment manufacturers for global dominance, including Huawei and ZTE from China, Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel (both from the U.S.). 5G is a key part of the geopolitical fault lines created by Donald Trump's desire to \"make America great again\" and China's stated goal of becoming a global hegemony in artificial intelligence by 2030; this technological race is a part of the U.S.-China trade war.  \nIn June 2020, the Trump administration formally announced its opposition to the construction of a new undersea Internet cable connecting Hong Kong with the United States, citing national security concerns. U.S. government officials worried that such a connection would allow Chinese intelligence direct access to U.S. data, boosting their capabilities at a time when China is making no secret of its global ambitions. Adam Hickey, a senior official from the Department of Justice on telecommunications, told Politico, \"It has the potential to establish Hong Kong as the center of gravity for U.S. data connectivity in Asia, offering unprecedented opportunities for collection by the Chinese intelligence services.\" While it is ultimately the FCC that will decide whether to approve the project, it frequently defers to an inter-governmental agency called Team Telecom. In a report, Team Telecom officials wrote, \"By combining personnel data with travel records, health records and credit information, China\u2019s intelligence services may have the capability to create in just a few years a database more detailed than any nation has ever possessed about one of its rivals.\" According to Google, the Hong Kong-U.S. data link will be 12,800 km (8,000 miles) long and will be able to accommodate 80 million teleconference calls between Hong Kong and Los Angeles. It is part of the wider Pacific Light Cable Network project\u2014backed by Google itself, Facebook, and other companies. Pacific Light also has portions connecting the U.S. with Taiwan and the Philippines, both of which received the green light from Team Telecom. This development occurs in the backdrop of deteriorating Sino-American trade relations, with President Trump vocally criticizing China for unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, China's imposition of a new national security law in Hong Kong, viewed by the U.S. as a threat to the Special Administrative Region's autonomy, and the COVID-19 global pandemic, which began in China and has fueled anti-Chinese sentiments among the American public.  \n### Telehealth  \nIn late March 2020, President Trump signed into law a stimulus package worth around two trillion dollars, the biggest in American history, in order to alleviate the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Besides cash infusion for front-line hospitals, loans for struggling industries, aid for farmers, enhanced unemployment benefits, relief for married couples with young children, and tax cuts for retailers, it included $200 million for telemedicine. This would help doctors examine their patients remotely, using video-conferencing technology. At present, the FCC operates a rural healthcare program that subsidizes the use of telecommunications technology. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai personally requested this aid in early March. Early that month, the President signed a bipartisan bill that extended Medicare coverage to include telemedicine in outbreak areas. Previously, it was restricted to rural residents who had to take long trips to see a doctor. Telemedicine reduces the need for travel, and therefore chances of vulnerable senior citizens catching COVID-19.  \n## Transportation  \n### Canals, ports, and harbors  \nPort of Savannah with intermodal yard at the top (February 2016)  \nCharleston Harbor, South Carolina, regularly hosts ships traveling through the recently expanded Panama Canal. South Carolina is also home to many manufacturing plants belonging to various multinational corporations, such as the automaker BMW, the tire maker Michelin, and many others. Works to deepen it to 52 feet (15.8 m) has been ongoing since 2011 but had never been on a federal budget proposed by the President till 2018, when a new cost-benefit analysis conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made it suitable for consideration. President Trump allocated $138 million (~$ in US-GDP) to the project in his budget in 2019. Dredging started in 2018, and the State Ports Authority, which operates Charleston Harbor, said it planned to complete the project by 2021, in time for a new container terminal to open. Upon completion, it will be the deepest shipping channel in the East Coast of the United States.  \nThe America's Water Infrastructure Act, signed into law by President Trump in October 2018 authorizes $6 billion (~$ in US-GDP) in spending. Potential recipients for federal funding include the Houston-Galveston Navigation Channel Extension ($15.6 million), and the Ala Wai Canal project in Hawaii ($306.5 million). This bill includes a five-year \"Buy American\" provision, which requires the use of American-made construction materials used by projects funded by the Act.  \nThe Port of Savannah, Georgia, is a busy shipping channel and the fourth largest in the United States. Worth almost a billion dollars, work has been underway since 2016 to deepen the harbor from 42 feet (12.8 m) to 47 feet (14.3 m) in order to accommodate heavier cargo ships taking advantage of the expanded Panama Canal to travel to and from the Eastern United States. At present, such ships are already visiting the Port, but they cannot carry their full loads at low tide. Cargo volumes to the Port of Savannah reached four million containers in 2017. If work goes one as scheduled, the deepening project is expected to be largely finished in 2022. As of 2020, the State of Georgia has already committed $300 million (~$ in US-GDP) to the project, but federal funding is needed. Although President Trump's budget proposals are unlikely to make much headway in a divided Congress that must sign off federal spending packages, due to a ban on earmarks to prevent lawmakers from adding pet projects to federal budgets, anything supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers is usually funded at the level requested in budget proposals. In 2019, despite funding cuts to the Corps, the Port of Savannah received the full $130.3 million requested by Trump while In 2018, it received $186 million. For his 2020 federal budget proposal, President Trump requested $86 million (~$ in US-GDP) for the project.  \n### Civil aviation  \nSome airlines are spending their own money on airport facilities. Pictured: An American Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner at LAX.  \nShortly after taking office in 2017, Donald Trump unveiled an infrastructure plan worth a trillion dollars that includes a $2.4 (~$ in US-GDP)-billion cut to federal transportation programs. This plan would eliminate subsidies for long-distance trains and commercial flights to rural communities with limited transportation options, including those that helped Trump win the presidency. He wanted to relieve the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of air traffic control and to turn it into a private nonprofit corporation.  \nIn June 2019, the FAA announced it was giving out $840 million in grants for improving airport facilities and President Trump proposed $17.1 billion in funding for the FAA. Trump's proposal made it through the House Appropriations Committee with $614 million more than requested. Therefore, the FAA had $17.7 billion to spend. Airport Improvement Programs (AIP) funds will go to over 380 airports in 47 states. One of the biggest grants is worth $29 million, which goes to runway reconstruction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska. In addition, the House Appropriations Committee announced $3.3 billion in AIP grants to be handed out in 2020, plus $500 million for discretionary airport infrastructure spending.  \nSome airliners themselves have been financing airport capital projects on their own. For example, American Airlines and Delta have committed $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, to modernize the facilities they use at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Delta allocated another four billion dollars to the construction of a new terminal at the LaGuardia International Airport in New York City. At the same time, a number of airports are willing to spend money on their own facilities in order to reap the long-term economic benefits. In May 2019, the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) announced it would spend some $3.5 billion on a new terminal and on renovating an existing terminal for American Airlines, which uses the airport as one of its main hubs in the U.S.  \nIn early 2020, American airports saw their passenger numbers plummet due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. To help them cope with the crisis, the Trump administration provided $10 billion in financial aid with Congressional approval.  \n### Public transportation  \nIn 2018, the Trump administration rolled out an infrastructure plan that allocates one quarter of the money available to rural areas, even though only 14% of Americans live there. This spells trouble for numerous large-scale urban projects and undermines aging transit networks in large established cities such as Chicago or New York City, which need significant funds for repairs, maintenance, and modernization, because it favors new construction. left  \nThe Gateway Program is a plan to modernize railroad infrastructure between New York and New Jersey and to double the number of trains passing between those two states. This plan includes repairs to the old North River Tunnel, and the construction of the new Hudson Tunnel.  \nAlthough he was initially in favor of the Gateway Project, Trump later turned against it and urged fellow Republicans to cut funding for it. Moreover, he dismissed the project as a local one that lacks national importance and a potential boondoggle. He subsequently cut money from the funds for the Gateway Program. While supporters of the Gateway Project argue that it is one of the nation's most pressing infrastructure needs, opponents are wary of additional federal spending and the fact that money will be taken away from smaller projects for their districts.Groundbreaking ceremony for Maryland's Purple Line in August 2017.  \nFederal funding for smaller projects, such as $900 million for the Washington Metro's Purple Line, was approved. However, Trump's infrastructure spending plan stalled due to from Democrats who took issue with the fact that Trump preferred private funding and highways to federal funding and public transit. Of the projected $1.5 trillion, the federal government would spend only $200 billion. Under the Obama administration, funding for transit on one hand and for highways and bridges on the other hand were roughly equal. Under the Trump administration, some 70% of the funding would go to highways and bridges and only about 11% to transit.  \nIn February 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom reduced the scale of the California High-Speed Rail project, from mi linking Los Angeles to San Francisco down to mi between Merced and Bakersfield, in response to spiraling costs. The State of California estimated the cost of Phase I of the project to be $77 billion, up $13 billion, but warned that the total cost could reach $100 billion. In fact, the project has been mired in cost overruns and delays. Moreover, even though it was initially planned to have one third of the funding from the private sector, the project failed to raise any funds from that source. In May 2019, the Trump administration cancels $929 million (~$ in US-GDP) in funding for the construction of the railway, whose trains could travel at speeds of up to mph. In a statement, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) wrote that the California High-speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) \"has failed to make reasonable progress on the Project\" and \"has abandoned its original vision of a high-speed passenger rail service connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles, which was essential to its applications for FRA grant funding.\" As of June 2019, the project found itself under investigation for financial malpractice. However, in July 2019, the Trump administration authorized the State of California to assume responsibility for ensuring the project is in compliance with federal environmental protection regulations, thereby lifting a major hurdle.  \nIn June 2019, the FRA announced $326 million (~$ in US-GDP) in funding for rail infrastructure upgrades for 45 projects in 29 states. These grants come under the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement (CRISI) Program, authorized by Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, and the Special Transportation Circumstances Program. One third of that amount will go to rural areas.  \nIn early April 2020, the Trump administration issued $25 billion (~$ in US-GDP) in emergency funding for public transportation networks across the United States facing a precipitous drop in ridership due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approved a week prior by Congress, the money would go primarily to densely populated urban areas, including $5.4 billion for New York City, $1.2 billion for Los Angeles, $1.02 billion for the District of Columbia, $883 million for Boston, $879 million for Philadelphia, $820 million for San Francisco and $520 million for Seattle. Meanwhile, some $2.2 billion would go to rural areas, the FTA announced. National passenger rail company Amtrak received a billion dollars.  \n## Water management  \nIn October 2018, President Trump signed into law the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, allocating more than $6 billion (~$ in US-GDP) on water infrastructure spending of all kinds. This bipartisan bill authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to manage water resource projects and policies nationwide. It also authorizes federal funding for various water infrastructure projects, including the expansion of water storage capabilities, and upgrades to wastewater, drinking and irrigation systems. This bill includes some $2.2 billion (~$ in US-GDP) for a coastal barrier Texas, protecting it from flood in the future. The coastal barrier includes not just flood walls and sea walls but also pumping stations, drainage facilities, and floodgates for highways and railroads. The money may also be used for ecosystem repair, upgrades to port and inland waterways, flood control, dam renovations, and enhancing drinking water facilities. Moreover, the Act reauthorizes the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan program.  \nIn April 2019, after signing two executive orders on energy infrastructure projects, President Trump said he would order the Environmental Protection Agency to issue guidelines for state compliance with the Clean Water Act.  \nIn May 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made $2.6 billion available for water infrastructure improvement across the United States. According to the Agency's own estimates, some $743 billion is needed, and the State Resolving Funds (SRFs), which require states to match federal funding and repay loans and interests, have provided $170 billion.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects a policy or action taken during the Trump administration as depicted in the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

Lipa further explained that she had always planned a reissue as she was very \"cutthroat\" when choosing the standard edition songs. In April 2020, she confirmed Future Nostalgia would receive a deluxe reissue and further teased it while serving as a guest Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen the following month. In July 2020, a fan commented on one of Lipa's Instagram posts asking for the release of the Future Nostalgia B-sides; Lipa replied and confirmed their release and also stated that she has \"enough music to hold her fans all the way through till 2022\".  \nLipa described \"Fever\" as an introduction to the B-sides. In a YouTube chat with her fans for the release of its music video, Lipa announced that the B-sides would be released in 2021. In January 2021, Lipa further teased the B-sides release with a post on social media with the caption \"B-sides are on the way\". She further teased it through until the next month. On 4 February 2021 Dua officially announced the reissue day and its title, Future Nostalgia: The Moonlight Edition. The Moonlight Edition was released one week later on 11 February 2021, alongside the reissue's lead single \"We're Good\".  \n## Critical reception  \nFuture Nostalgia received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album has an average score of 88, based on 19 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 8.5 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. According to Metacritic, Future Nostalgia is the 15th most acclaimed album released in 2020.  \nWriting for NME, Rhian Daly wrote that \"Future Nostalgia is a bright, bold collection of pop majesty to dance away your anxieties to... if only for a little while\". Chris Taylor of The Line of Best Fit praised Lipa's direction for the album, saying \"Future Nostalgia is an artist in total control. It's built on such an addictive carefree spirit that it's hard not to let loose and go with it. The greatest pop star of this generation? That's for you to decide. But Future Nostalgia makes a very convincing argument that Dua Lipa just might be\". Chris Willman of Variety praised the album's musical direction, writing \"after calling it a great disco record, we might also call Future Nostalgia a great MTV-era album that just happens to be not of the MTV era\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos also praised the album's musical direction, writing \"Future Nostalgia is a breathtakingly fun, cohesive and ambitious attempt to find a place for disco in 2020\".  \nWriting for DIY, Elly Watson wrote \"this album has proved: Dua will be going down in pop history as one of the best\". Laura Snapes of The Guardian complimented Lipa's choice of songs, writing \"The 11-track Future Nostalgia offers neither features nor filler, and makes a strident case for Lipa as a pop visionary, not a vessel\". Michael Cragg of Crack summarised the album as \"packed with full-throttle choruses, supple melodies and lashings of attitude, Future Nostalgia is a neon-hued sound of one of the world's biggest pop stars smashing it out of the park\". Similarly, Craig Jenkins of Vulture commended the \"sturdy\" songs, also writing that Minogue and Madonna are their \"predecessors\" sonically. Jenkins concluded that Lipa has \"only scratched the surface of what she's capable of\".  \nIn his Substack-published \"Consumer Guide\" column, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention and called it an \"Olivia Newton-John tribute as dance smash as what-me-despair placebo, that deserves props for adding two keepers to that canon\", namely the title track and \"Good in Bed\".  \n### Year-end lists  \nFuture Nostalgia placed in the top ten of the year-end lists of several publications, including being viewed as 2020's best album by Entertainment.ie, Gaffa, GQ, People, Slate and Vogue India.  \n## Awards and nominations  \n## Commercial performance  \nFuture Nostalgia debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with 34,390 units, only 550 units behind 5 Seconds of Summer's Calm. In its second week, it reached the summit of the chart, with Future Nostalgia becoming Lipa's first UK number one album. The album would go on to top the chart for three more non-consecutive weeks. On 17 April 2020, it was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling over 60,000 units in the UK. The album holds the record for having the lowest one-week sales while at the top of the chart in the modern era, when it was number one the week beginning 15 May 2020 with sales of only 7,317. It was certified double Platinum by the BPI in 2022, having shifted over 600,000 units to date in the UK. In October 2021, the BBC's music correspondent Mark Savage noted that Future Nostalgia was the only British album released since the start of 2020 to have been certified Platinum by the BPI.  \nJust like in the UK, Future Nostalgia entered the Australian album chart at number two before rising to the top in April 2020. After charting for almost a year the album climbed back to the number one spot in March 2021. It was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for the 35,000 units sold. Following the release of the album's Australian tour edition vinyl in April 2022, the album returned to number one for a third non-consecutive week in its 108th week on the chart.  \nThe album topped the record charts of 14 countries, including Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain.  \nFuture Nostalgia debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 dated 11 April 2020, with 66,000 album-equivalent units, including 18,000 pure album sales. A major improvement over her self-titled debut album (which peaked at number 27), it became Lipa's first top 10 album on the chart. The following week, the album dropped to number 8, with sales declining by 43% to nearly 38,000 units. It remained within the top ten in its third week. As of December 2020, the album has sold 931,000 album-equivalent units in the United States. After the release of its reissue The Moonlight Edition in February 2021, the album surged back at number seven on the Billboard 200, reaching the top 10 for the first time in 10 months with 32,000 album-equivalent units earned, increasing by 58% compared to the previous week. On the chart dated 27 March 2021, following Lipa's performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, one year after its initial release, the album reached a peak of number three on the chart, moving 37,000 album-equivalent units that week.  \nAccording to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Future Nostalgia was the tenth most successful album of 2020 worldwide, with 3.3 million album-equivalent units sold. In 2021, the album once again made IFPI's Global Album All-Format Chart at number six.  \nThe album is currently 6th most streamed album of all time on Spotify with over 10 Billion streams.  \n## Impact  \nAccording to Billboard, as of 2022, Future Nostalgia is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100. According to Tom Corson, co-chairman of Warner Records, Lipa has \"the benefit of being a pioneer\" for being \"the first major pop star to release an album in quarantine\". David Levesley of GQ magazine described Future Nostalgia as \"the decade's first great pop album\" and explained that the album \"balances stadium anthems with also being a gospel of feminine excellence for all the teens looking to her for inspiration\". while Chris Willman of Variety called the album the \"Reigning Dance-Pop Album of the Century\", compared it to Taylor Swift's Folklore, and further wrote that both albums \"barely seemed to exist in the same world, let alone genre, but they effectively captured a populace's polarized reactions to the cessation of normal life as anyone knew it\". Rolling Stone described Future Nostalgia as \"the disco liberation soundtrack we need\" during COVID-19 pandemic.  \nThe Daily Beast called the album a \"apocalypse game-changer\" and emphasized that it will \"have us dancing until the world ends\". The Wall Street Journal called Lipa \"one of the biggest breakout stars of lockdown\" due to the critical and commercial success of the album. According to BBC News, Lipa is one of the artists who brought the 80s back to the music industry. She was also one of the UK's most-played artist in 2020 as the album \"proved to be the soundtrack to many people's quarantine, with its uplifting disco anthems providing the perfect antidote to isolation\". Upon the release of Drake's Honestly, Nevermind and Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance, both in 2022, some publications cited Future Nostalgia as the predictor of a house music revival.  \n## Track listing  \n#\n\nQuestion: Which song from the descriptions provided features a sample of the trumpet from Lew Stone's 1932 recording \"My Woman\"?\nChoice list: \nA. \"Boys Will Be Boys\"\nB. \"Love Again\"\nC. \"Break My Heart\"\nD. \"Good in Bed\"\nYour answer is: ",

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Chris Jericho, who won an opportunity for the inaugural AEW World Championship by defeating Kenny Omega in the main event\nOn January 4, 2018, at New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 12, Kenny Omega defeated Chris Jericho in their first encounter. In September at All In, after Omega defeated Penta El Zero, he was attacked by Jericho. The following month, the two were involved in a six-man tag team match at Jericho's Rock 'N' Wrestling Rager at Sea event, where Omega's team defeated Jericho's. In January 2019, Jericho signed with AEW and after Omega announced that he had signed with the promotion the following month, he was confronted by Jericho and the two brawled but were separated by Cody, Christopher Daniels, and security. A rematch from Wrestle Kingdom 12 was later announced for Double or Nothing. It was later confirmed that the winner would face the winner of the Casino Battle Royale for the inaugural AEW World Championship at a later date.  \nAt AEW's inaugural rally in Jacksonville, Britt Baker announced that she had signed with AEW. The following month during AEW's Las Vegas rally, Brandi Rhodes announced that Kylie Rae and Nyla Rose had also signed with the promotion. Following some remarks from Rae, she was interrupted by Rose and the two had a stare down but were separated before a brawl could occur. One day later, a three-way match between Baker, Rae, and Rose was announced for the event.  \nDuring AEW's Las Vegas rally, The Lucha Brothers (Pentag\u00f3n Jr. and Rey F\u00e9nix) announced they had signed with AEW. Following the announcement, the duo attacked The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). On February 23, 2019 at AAW Wrestling's The Art of War, The Young Bucks attacked The Lucha Brothers. Two days later, a match between the two teams was announced for Double or Nothing. On March 16 at AAA's Rey de Reyes, The Young Bucks defeated The Lucha Brothers for the AAA World Tag Team Championship, subsequently turning their Double or Nothing match into a rematch for the championship.  \nOn February 20, 2019, on The Road to Double or Nothing, Cody announced the second Over the Budget Battle Royale for the Buy In pre-show, with initial participants being Sonny Kiss, Kip Sabian, and Brandon Cutler. On May 6, the match was renamed Casino Battle Royale. The rules were that there would be 21 entrants. Five entrants would start the match and every three minutes, five more wrestlers entered with the 21st and final entrant entering alone. It was later confirmed that the winner would receive a future AEW World Championship match against the winner of the match between Kenny Omega and Chris Jericho. On May 8, it was announced that Kip Sabian would face Sammy Guevara on the Buy In pre-show.  \nOn April 20, 2019, after weeks of teasing opponents, it was announced that Cody would face his brother Dustin Rhodes at Double or Nothing. Dustin was most famously known for his gimmick of Goldust in WWE, which granted his release in early 2019. In the following weeks, Cody declared that he would defeat his brother as a way to \"kill\" the Attitude Era.\n\n#### Canceled match  \nAt AEW's inaugural rally in Jacksonville, Adam Page was interrupted by Pac, setting up a feud between the two wrestlers. At AEW's second rally in Las Vegas, a match between Page and Pac was officially announced for Double or Nothing. However, in late May it was reported that the match was \"canceled\" and would no longer take place due to \"creative differences\". As a result of the cancellation, they wrestled a match at Wrestle Gate Pro about a week before Double or Nothing. In a surprise appearance, Page answered an open challenge by Pac that ended in disqualification with Page winning. After the match, Pac attacked Page's knee and said that his goal all along was to injure Page and with that done, he had no reason to show up at Double or Nothing. This was done to write the match off the card. Later that week on an episode of Being The Elite, Page was selling the knee injury and said he could not wrestle at Double or Nothing.  \n## Event  \n### The Buy-In  \nTwo matches occurred during the Buy In. The first was the Casino Battle Royale, in which the winner would face the winner of the main event to determine the inaugural AEW World Champion at All Out. Adam Page, the 21st and final entrant, won by last eliminating MJF.  \nIn the second match, Kip Sabian faced Sammy Guevera. Sabian performed The Deathly Hallows on Guevera to win the match.  \n### Preliminary matches  \nThe actual pay-per-view opened with SoCal Uncensored (Christopher Daniels, Frankie Kazarian, and Scorpio Sky) facing Strong Hearts (Cima, T-Hawk, and El Lindaman). Daniels and Kazarian performed the Best Meltzer Ever on Lindaman to win the match.  \nNext, a Triple Threat match between Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D, Nyla Rose and Kylie Rae was scheduled. Before the match, Brandi Rhodes announced Awesome Kong as a participant, thus the match was changed to a fatal four-way. Baker performed a Brainbuster onto her Knee on Rae to win the match.  \nAfter that, Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta) faced Ang\u00e9lico and Jack Evans. Taylor and Beretta performed Strong Zero on Evans to win the match.  \nLater, Hikaru Shida, Riho, and Ryo Mizunami faced Aja Kong, Emi Sakura, and Yuka Sakazaki. Shida performed a Running Knee Strike on Sakura to win the match.  \nIn the fifth match, Cody (accompanied by his wife, Brandi Rhodes) faced his brother, Dustin Rhodes. Brandi tackled Dustin on the floor, leading to referee Earl Hebner ejecting her, which Diamond Dallas Page removed her following Hebner's request. Dustin performed a Final Cut on Cody for a near-fall. Cody performed a Disaster Kick and Cross Rhodes on Dustin for a near-fall. Cody performed a second Cross Rhodes on Dustin to win. After the match, Cody announced he would team with Dustin against The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) at Fight for the Fallen. Cody and Dustin embraced in the ring after the announcement.  \nIn the penultimate match, The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) defended the AAA World Tag Team Championship against Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr and Rey Fenix). Matt and Nick performed the Meltzer Driver on Fenix to retain the title.  \n### Main event  \nIn the main event, Chris Jericho faced Kenny Omega; the winner would face Adam Page to determine the inaugural AEW World Champion at All Out. Omega performed a Baseball Slide and Rise of the Terminator on Jericho into a table. Omega performed a Springboard Double Foot Stomp on the table on Jericho. Jericho performed a Back Body Drop on Omega through the table on the floor. Omega dove off the top rope but Jericho countered into a Codebreaker for a nearfall. Omega attempted a One-Winged Angel but Jericho countered into a DDT and performed a second Codebreaker on Omega. In the end, Jericho then performed the Judas Effect on Omega to win the match. After the match, Jon Moxley (formerly Dean Ambrose in WWE) appeared and attacked both Jericho and Omega. Omega fought back and the two brawled up the entrance ramp where Moxley performed a standing fireman's carry takeover on Omega through the stage.  \n## Reception  \n### Tickets and buys  \nAccording to Dave Meltzer, there were 11,000 tickets for Double or Nothing. Of these tickets, \"almost all\" were sold in a pre-sale on February 11, 2019, in around or less than 30 minutes, to people who had earlier provided their email addresses. Travel packages and VIP packages also sold out. Ticket sales were opened to the general public on February 13, 2019, and sold out in 4 minutes.  \nOn the June 3, 2019 edition of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Dave Meltzer wrote that Double or Nothing received \"roughly 98,000 buys between television and digital PPV, with close to a 50/50 split between the two ... About two-thirds came from the U.S., with the U.K., which aired the pre-show on ITV4, being the strong second followed by Australia, Germany and Canada.\" Meltzer predicted that further replay buys of Double or Nothing \"should easily\" result in it overtaking \"ECW's biggest-ever show (99,000) and becoming the biggest PPV in pro wrestling history that wasn't produced by WWE or WCW.\" Meltzer additionally described that no one has achieved this level of buys \"without regular television exposure since the 2002 Tito Ortiz vs. Ken Shamrock and UFC 47|2004 Chuck Liddell vs. Ortiz mixed martial arts fights\". On the June 10 edition, Meltzer wrote that Double or Nothing \"is estimated at somewhere between 98,500 and 113,000 buys worldwide. The best estimate has U.S. PPV buys at around 71,000, with almost an exact 50/50 split between television and B/R Live. That\u2019s notable because nobody does a 50/50 split. The biggest split I\u2019ve heard of for a television PPV and streaming was Conor McGregor vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov, which was an 80/20 split in favor of television. Usually it\u2019s closer to 85/15\".  \n### Critical reception  \nJohn Powell of Canadian Online Explorer's Slam! Wrestling noted that Double or Nothing \"proved without a doubt that AEW is THE competition to WWE, THE alternative to WWE, THE very change the wrestling industry and wrestling fans have been waiting for\", with Kenny Omega, Cody Rhodes, Adam Page, Nick and Matt Jackson being the \"faces of the wrestling revolution some fans have been waiting for since March 26, 2001, when Monday Nitro went off the air and WWE bought WCW.\"  \nA CBS Sports article jointly written by Brian Campbell, Jack Crosby and Adam Silverstein declared that Double or Nothing \"felt very much like a historic card that boldly announced new competition for the long-time industry leader WWE\", as they successfully built \"anticipation of the launch of their weekly fall show on TNT\". They highlighted \"AEW's first viral moment\" created by the unannounced appearance of Jon Moxley, the \"blood and tears exchanged by the Rhodes brothers\", and the \"theatrics and aerial exploits of Kenny Omega, The Young Bucks and The Lucha Bros\".  \nTim Fiorvanti of ESPN declared: \"Double or Nothing was not a perfect first effort for AEW, but the show hit hard where it counted most -- storytelling, emotion and surprise.\" The emotion and storytelling was brought by the \"vicious, bloody war waged between brothers Cody and Dustin Rhodes\". Chris Jericho's win and the appearances of Jon Moxley and Awesome Kong were the surprises. Also, Fiorvanti felt \"the entire card reminded people how good tag-team wrestling can be when it's at its best\" and \"offered a tremendous cross section of what the future of women's wrestling will look like.\"  \nSean Radican of Pro Wrestling Torch described the event as \"fantastic first outing overall for AEW\". Omega-Jericho had a \"very sudden, but good finish\", Cody-Dustin \"was a classic throwback bloodbath that had a ton of heat\", while Young Bucks-Lucha Bros \"was a state-of-the-art tag team classic\". However, Radican noted that there \"were some warts with production and commentary\", and also preferred removing \"the pre-show and most of the undercard matches\" as the event would have been a \"total home run\" for him if it were shortened to two hours.  \nJason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net wrote that AEW \"delivered big in its first pay-per-view effort\". The \"big three matches\" that ended the event \"made the show\" because they \"had real storyline support and were very well worked\". Cody-Dustin had the \"intensity, drama, and the storyline of two brothers doing battle\", Young Bucks-Lucha Bros was a \"spot crazy match that also had good emotion\", while Jericho and Omega \"definitely left it all in the ring\" despite a match that \"was sloppy here and there\".  \nMike Tedesco of WrestleView described Double or Nothing as an \"amazing show\" that \"started slow\" but ultimately reminded him \"why pro wrestling can be fun and exciting when done right\". The AAA World Tag title match was \"off the hook fun\" and \"got a little spotty, but the athleticism was on another level.\" The main event had \"great drama and action\" and \"everything made sense.\" Jon Moxley's \"amazing introduction\" \"sets him right at the top of the ladder\". However, Tedesco \"cringed with some of the comments made toward WWE\".  \nDave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter wrote that Double or Nothing \"will go down as one of the landmark PPVs in history, both because of the match quality but more the atmosphere created by the fans.\" Also, from \"a creative standpoint and connecting with fans, AEW blew away WWE\". The show indicated \"the value of social media\" and \"the dissatisfaction with WWE\". Meltzer said the Cody-Dustin match \"stole the show\", giving it five full stars. In a poll done by the newsletter of over 1700 respondents, 97.5% gave a \"thumbs up\" to the show, 1.8% were neutral, while 0.7% gave a \"thumbs down\". The publication later awarded it the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Major Wrestling Show of 2019.  \nIn November, Troy L. Smith of cleveland.com released a list of the \"50 greatest wrestling pay-per-views of all time\" from every professional wrestling promotion in the world, with Double or Nothing ranked at number 46, writing that the first AEW pay-per-view event \"feels like something that will eventually mark a turning point in the wrestling industry.\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated awarded the Cody vs. Dustin Rhodes match the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Award for Match of the Year.  \n## Aftermath  \nA week after Double or Nothing, the inaugural AEW World Championship match between Chris Jericho and Adam Page was confirmed for AEW's event, All Out, on August 31, 2019. At All Out, Jericho defeated Page to become the first-ever AEW World Champion.  \nFollowing the confrontation between Jon Moxley and Kenny Omega, a match between the two was scheduled for All Out, but it was cancelled due to Moxley suffering an elbow injury. It was then rescheduled for Full Gear in November. At Full Gear, Moxley emerged victorious.  \nAfter settling creative differences, Pac returned to AEW and replaced Jon Moxley in a match against Kenny Omega at All Out that Pac won. During Adam Page's post-event interview following his loss to Chris Jericho for the AEW World Championship at All Out, Pac interrupted the interview and said he returned to AEW to seek revenge against Page. The two were then scheduled to face each other during the debut broadcast of AEW's television show, AEW Dynamite on October 2.  \nDouble or Nothing has since been called AEW's marquee event, and along with their next three major PPVs, All Out, Full Gear, and Revolution, the four together are considered AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, their four biggest shows produced quarterly.  \n## Results  \n### Casino Battle Royale entrances and eliminations  \nFive wrestlers started the match. Every three minutes, five more wrestlers entered. The 21st and final entrant entered alone.\n\nQuestion: Which event did the person in the second image win an opportunity for the inaugural championship by defeating his opponent in the main event?\nChoice list: \nA.

It is located in the center of the oblast and borders with Vyshnevolotsky District in the north, Torzhoksky District in the east, Staritsky District in the south, Selizharovsky District in the southwest, Ostashkovsky District in the west, and with Firovsky District in the northwest. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the town of Kuvshinovo. Population: 15,386 (2010 Census); p1989=20,601 The population of Kuvshinovo accounts for 65.0% of the district's total population.  \n## Geography  \nKuvshinovsky District list in the southern part of the Valdai Hills, and the divide between the drainage basins of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caspian Sea runs through the district. The northern part of the district belongs to the drainage basin of the Tsna River, a tributary of Lake Mstino in the drainage basin of the Neva and the Baltic Sea. The Tsna itself has its source the district. The rivers in the center and in the south of the district belong to the basin of the Volga. The major part of the district belongs to the basin of the Osuga River, which crosses the district from est to east. The rivers in the southern part of the district drain into the Bolshaya Kosha, which has its source in the district. The Osuga is a right tributary of the Tvertsa, a left tributary of the Volga, whereas the Bolshaya Kosha is a left tributary of the Volga. 76% of the area of the district is occupied by forest.  \n## History  \n<ImageHere>An abandoned house in the village of Pechnikovo.\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and the area was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. The area was divided between Novotorzhsky (with the center in Torzhok) and Vyshnevolotsky (Vyshny Volochyok) uyezds.  \nOn 1 October 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Kamensky District with the administrative center in the settlement of Kuvshinovo was established. It belonged to Rzhev Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On January\u00a029, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Kamensky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In 1938, Kuvshinovo was merged with the nearby selo of Kamenka and granted town status. In February\u00a01963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Novotorzhsky, Likhoslavlsky, and Kamensky Districts were merged into a new district which was called Torzhoksky District. On January 12, 1965 Kuvshinovsky District (which occupied the same area as the former Kamensky District) was re-established. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.\n\n## Economy  \n### Industry  \nAs of 2010, the paper production was responsible for 92.4% of the total industrial output of the district. Production of electrical equipment, textile, and food was also present. The Kuvshinovo Paper Mill (built in the 19th century by merchant Kuvshinov, hence the name) was producing paper until the 1990s, and then the local timber production stopped, and the mill had to switch to cardboard production.  \n### Agriculture  \n<ImageHere>A tower in the village of Lukino\nThe main agricultural specializations of the district are cattle breeding with meat and milk production, as well as crops and potato growing.\n\n### Transportation  \nA railway line which connects Likhoslavl with Soblago via Torzhok and Selizharovo crosses the area of the district from east to west and passes Kuvshinovo. It is served by infrequent passenger traffic.  \nA road connecting Torshok with Ostashkov crosses the district from east to west and runs through Kuvshinovo. Another road connects Kuvshinovo with Vyshny Volochyok via Yesenovichi. There are local roads as well, with the bus traffic originating from Kuvshinovo.  \n## Culture and recreation  \nMogilyovskaya Pustyn  \nThe district contains forty cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally twenty-nine objects (three of them in Kuvshinovo) classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federally protected monuments include the ensembles of Borok, Gornitsy, Pryamukhino, and Velemozhye Estates, of the Mogilyovskaya Pustyn monastery, as well as several churches of the 18th and the 19th centuries.  \nKuvshinovo has a local museum. Pryamukhino Estate belonged to the Bakunin family. In the estate, Mikhail Bakunin was born. Currently, a museum is open in Pryamukhino.\n\nQuestion: Which description corresponds to the image of the abandoned house?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nEngraving of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu by Samuel Freeman, after a portrait by Sir Godfrey Kneller\nDespite opposition, variolation established itself as a mainstream medical treatment in England. Part of its success was founded on statistical observation, which confirmed that variolation was a safer alternative to contracting smallpox naturally, strengthened by the assumption that it protected against the disease for life. The major faults of variolation lay in its simplicity. Doctors sought to monopolize the simple treatment by convincing the public that the procedure could only be done by a trained professional. The procedure was now preceded by a severe bloodletting, in which the patient was bled, often to faintness, in order to 'purify' the blood and prevent fever. Doctors also began to favour deep incisions, which also discouraged amateurs.\n\n### The Suttonian Method  \nThe main proponents of the English variolation movement were the Suttons, a family of physicians who would revolutionize the practice. The patriarch, Robert Sutton, was a surgeon from Suffolk. In 1757 the procedure failed on one of his sons. He sought a new method in which the procedure would become as mild as possible. By 1762 he began advertising \"A New Method of Inoculating for Small-Pox.\" Sutton kept his method a secret and shared it only with his three sons. The mystique and effectiveness behind this new method helped to promote their business, which soon became very successful. They established a network of variolation houses and clinics and offered franchises to other variolators for a share of the profits, on condition that the secret would not be revealed. By 1770, the Suttons had treated over 300,000 satisfied customers. Daniel, the eldest of the Sutton sons, eventually revealed the family secret in his book The Inoculator, published in 1796. The success of their method lay in a shallow scratch, careful selection of only mildly affected donors, and no bleeding or extreme purging. Although the renown of the Suttons gradually faded after this revelation, the family's lasting impression would remain for generations.  \nThomas Nettleton (1683\u20131748) was a precursor of the Suttons around 1722.  \nOther prominent English variolators included Thomas Dimsdale, who published accounts of his method in 1769 and 1781; William Woodville, appointed Director of the London Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital in 1791, who published a history of variolation in 1796; and John Haygarth, who published an ambitious plan to exterminate smallpox in 1783.  \n### Johnnie Notions  \nJohn Williamson, more commonly known by the nickname Johnnie Notions, was a self-taught physician from Shetland, Scotland, who independently developed and successfully administered a variolation for smallpox to thousands of patients in Shetland during the late 18th century. Despite having only an elementary education and no formal medical background, the effectiveness of the treatment he devised yielded an extremely high success rate, resulting in the immunisation of approximately 3,000 people and the saving of many lives, which had a significant effect on the demographics of the Shetland population at the time. He is reputed to have not lost a single patient.  \nNotions would first collect smallpox pus. He would then dry it using peat smoke (which was believed to lessen the virus's virulence), and bury it in the ground with camphor (which has anti-bacterial properties, preventing the matter from decomposing). Oral history indicates the matter was spread between sheets of glass before burial. It would be kept in this state for up to seven or eight years to reduce its virulence before being administered to a patient. By using a knife (which Notions made himself) he would incise into the patient's arm intradermally (without drawing blood), insert a small amount of the matter, and immediately cover the incision with the patient's skin, before using a cabbage leaf as a plaster. In contrast to contemporaneous quack doctors, Notions would not stipulate any particular resting conditions (such as \"hot-treatment\" \u2013 heating the ill patient in front of a fire, covering them with blankets and allowing them no fresh-air), nor would he administer any other medicines during the period of infection and recovery.  \nNotions' variolation bears a strong similarity to the Suttonian method. How Notions became aware of this method of variolation is unclear \u2013 it may have been through written account, or through discussion with someone else aware of the technique, such as another physician or a member of the clergy.  \n### Widespread recognition  \n<ImageHere>\"Queens\" of Mysore: left, Krishnaraja Wadiyar III's first wife, Devajammani has a discoloration around the mouth, thought to be due to the blowing of variolation dust in the nose (\"nasal insufflation\"). Right, his second wife shows the discrete mark left by vaccination under her saree. Thomas Hickey, 1805.\nIn 1738, variolation was added to the second edition of Chambers' Cyclop\u00e6dia, which in its time was an authority of knowledge for the literary class. Later in 1754, variolation received the sanction of the Royal College of Physicians. All of this made England the international center of variolation, attracting visitors from all over the world to explore this \"new\" method of prevention. The nation also acted as a magnet for those who sought to introduce the benefits of variolation to their own countries. A remarkable example of this is the introduction of variolation into Russia. Thomas Dimsdale, a prominent banker, politician, and physician, was invited to visit St Petersburg to variolate Catherine the Great. In 1769, he variolated Catherine, her 14-year-old son Grand Duke Paul, and over 140 prominent members of the Court. The results were successful. Dimsdale was created a baron of the Russian Empire, and awarded \u00a310,000, with \u00a32000 for expenses and an annuity of \u00a3500. His son, who accompanied him, was also rewarded. In case Dimsdale's variolations had ended badly, Catherine had arranged a relay of horses to carry them safely out of the country.  \nFrance was the last European country to embrace variolation. It was not until an outbreak of smallpox in Paris in 1752 nearly killed the heir to the French throne that the public embraced the practice after seeing the prince variolated. Similarly in Japan, Chinese merchant Li Jen-Shan proposed the method of traditional Chinese intranasal variolation after a severe smallpox outbreak in Nagasaki in 1744. This led Japanese physician 3=\u7dd2\u65b9\u6625\u6714 to variolate children using a human smallpox vaccination method during an outbreak in Chikuzen Province from 1789 to 1790. There were no deaths among the children, and they all appeared to be protected.  \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, variolation had gained widespread global respect and was thought to be one of the greatest medical successes of its time. It had become the subject of serious medical study, leading physicians like John Haygarth from Chester, England, to explore its application on a larger scale. In 1793 he published A Sketch of a Plan to Exterminate the Small-Pox from Great Britain. This relied on rules summarised by Donald Hopkins; Its implementation at the time was impractical for logistical reasons and the risk that variolation would spread smallpox. However, with suitable modifications, such as the substitution of vaccination for variolation, it was remarkably similar to the strategy adopted during the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication campaign.\n\n## Spread into America  \nDocumentation of variolation in the Americas may be traced back to 1706 in Boston, where Puritan minister Cotton Mather learned of the technique from his West African slave Onesimus. Further research into the matter revealed to Mather that several other slaves had too been variolated. In 1714, he came across Timoni's article in Philosophical Transactions, in which he described methods of variolation found in Turkey. Mather was able to implement this new method in 1721 when Boston suffered a smallpox outbreak, although others such as William Douglass strongly opposed the idea.  \nThe main arguments against variolation were on religious grounds. Because religion was never far from any aspect of life in eighteenth-century Boston, several wondered how this new method would coincide with religious teachings. The simplest debate argued that variolation was ungodly because it was not mentioned specifically in the Bible. Inoculation was also viewed by some as a direct affront to God's innate right to determine who was to die, and how and when death would occur. Several believed smallpox outbreaks were well-merited punishments for the sins of those who contracted the disease. Those who were empirically minded saw the notion of using the products of such a deadly disease to prevent said disease as being an insult to logic.  \nDespite these persistent arguments, Mather also gained several supporters. Among this group of followers was surgeon Zabdiel Boylston, who urged Mather to further promote the procedure. With the support of Mather, Boylston went on to successfully variolate 300 patients, with only six of them dying. By contrast, 1,000 of the 6,000 people who acquired smallpox naturally died during the same period. Boylston traveled to London in 1724. There he published his results and was elected to the Royal Society in 1726.  \nFrom Boston, the practice spread throughout the colonies. In 1775, George Washington ordered that the Continental Army be variolated. By the end of the American Revolutionary War, variolation had gained widespread acceptance in the larger cities and towns of the United States.  \n## Transition into vaccination  \nThe success of variolation led many, including medical professionals, to overlook its drawbacks. Variolation was practiced on the basis that it protected against smallpox for life, and was far less likely to kill than natural infection. In some cases however, natural smallpox or variolation failed to protect from a second attack. These cases were a result of a lapse of immune \"memory\", while others may have been misdiagnosed (experts often confused smallpox with chickenpox). Variolation also required a level of skill and attention to detail which some physicians lacked. Many physicians failed to take note of local redness and discharge to assure the variolation had taken, resulting in inadequate treatment. However, it was its great risk to others that led to the end of the practice. The collateral smallpox cases spread by variolated subjects shortly after variolation began to outweigh the benefits of the procedure.  \nFrom the 1760s, a number of individuals, including John Fewster, Peter Plett, Benjamin Jesty, and particularly Edward Jenner, were interested in the use of material from cowpox, an animal infection, to protect against smallpox. In 1796, Jenner vaccinated James Phipps, did more vaccinations in 1798, and was the first to publish evidence that cowpox protected against smallpox, was safer than variolation, and that his vaccine could be maintained by arm-to-arm transfer. The use of variolation soon began to decline as the smallpox vaccine became widely used and its benefits appreciated. Various countries made variolation illegal, starting with Russia in 1805.  \nVariolation served as a natural precursor to the discovery of vaccination. The major differences between the two were that in vaccination, material from cowpox, an animal disease, was used, but particularly that it was far safer to those vaccinated and was far more rarely transmitted to their contacts. Vaccination offered the public a less-harmful method of preventing smallpox. Vaccination would revolutionize the control of smallpox, leading to its eventual eradication. The extension of the principle of vaccination by Pasteur and his successors would lead to the development of vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza, and make the eradication of infectious diseases, particularly poliomyelitis, a realistic prospect.  \n## Decline  \nAlthough variolation eventually declined or was banned in some countries, it was still practiced in others. \"Buying the smallpox\" was still practiced in Sudan until the late nineteenth century. However, variolation survived longer elsewhere. During the World Health Organization's Smallpox Eradication Campaign, vaccination teams came across variolators in remote areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan and their samples were confiscated. In the early stages of the campaign, live virus was detected in some, but as the campaign progressed variolators could not replenish their stocks, and although virus particles were detected in some samples, very few contained live virus.683\u201385 Our knowledge about the survival of smallpox virus suggests that passage of time makes it extremely unlikely that any infectious samples have survived.1173\u201377  \n## Other diseases  \nAlthough variolation has ceased, it has influenced the concept of other traditional practices, such as \"pox parties\", in which children are intentionally exposed to diseases like chickenpox, measles and rubella, in an attempt to gain immunity. Although strongly discouraged by public health officials, the practice persists.  \nWhile intentional exposure has been rejected as a strategy to combat COVID-19 because of the risks involved, there is also a hypothesis that widespread to universal use of face coverings is associated with a higher proportion of asymptomatic or relatively mild infections because of the decreased dose of viral particles expelled or received by the wearer, as a welcome addition to their primary purpose of significantly reducing transmission by asymptomatic wearers.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true based on the information provided in the descriptions of the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

The game follows the character of Ophelia from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. In Elsinore, Ophelia has a vision of the deaths of everyone in Elsinore Castle and relives the same four days again and again as she works to prevent the tragedy that will fall over everyone.  \nDevelopment on Elsinore took over seven years, and was carried out on nights and weekends by its development team. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who noted that fans of Hamlet would appreciate it but that the game's slow pace could be sometimes frustrating.  \n## Gameplay  \n<ImageHere>Laertes and Hamlet duel as Ophelia watches. The journal and other ways the player can see what is happening in Elsinore Castle are found in the top left, while a map shows Ophelia's current location in the top right.\nElsinore is a point-and-click adventure game based on William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. The player controls the character of Ophelia as she experiences a time loop leading up to the tragedy at the end of the play. During the four days leading up to those events, the player moves Ophelia throughout Elsinore Castle and talks with its residents in order to manipulate the outcome of events. The conversations the player has leads to unforeseen outcomes in which tragedy still occurs in other ways\u2014every time Ophelia dies, the time loop begins again, four days before the end of Hamlet.  \nTo manipulate events, the player talks to the castle's residents about events that they have witnessed or expect to occur. The game provides a \"Hearsay\" menu, which shows which topics can be broached. As Ophelia goes through multiple loops and witnesses scenes, she remembers these when she wakes up again and can bring them up to other characters. The game includes a branching timeline that shows the player possibilities they can be aware of, showing both the location of an event to happen and the time of it. Outside of Ophelia's deaths, the game has 13 unique endings that change based on the player's choices throughout the game.\n\n## Plot  \nThe plot of Hamlet revolves around the Danish court of the recently deceased King Hamlet. Denmark fears that an invasion from Prince Fortinbras of Norway could be imminent. Prince Hamlet, son of the recently deceased king and nephew to King Claudius, meets his father's ghost. The ghost reveals that he was murdered by Claudius and makes Hamlet vow to avenge his death. Believing him to be Claudius, Hamlet accidentally kills Polonius, enraging Polonius' son, Laertes. After an attempt to kill Hamlet fails, Claudius and Laertes plot to murder him in a duel by using a poisoned sword and poison in the prince's drink. Ophelia, Laertes' sister, drowns Hamlet returns for Ophelia's funeral and gets into a fight with Laertes. Hamlet and Laertes duel, and through various means both of them die along with Claudius and Queen Gertrude. Fortinbras arrives as Hamlet's heir and takes the crown of Denmark.  \nElsinore begins with a vision of the deaths of everyone in Elsinore Castle, similar to the play's ending. Ophelia then manipulates events to achieve a different outcome. If the player does nothing, the events unfold as in the play and everyone dies. After Ophelia's first death, a time loop begins where she wakes up at the moment of Hamlet where Prince Hamlet is behaving erratically in her room. Ophelia's actions directly affect the plot in sometimes unpredictable ways. If Ophelia continually talks to people in Elsinore Castle about the supernatural dreams she has been having, the characters will send Ophelia off to an institution because they are convinced she has gone insane. In order to convince Hamlet to ally with Ophelia and to have him trust her with his plot, the player must search Queen Gertrude's chambers for evidence that she was not complicit with the murder of her late husband. By confronting King Claudius with evidence that he has murdered Queen Gertrude, Claudius arranges a private meeting with Ophelia and murders her.  \nThe game enlarges Ophelia and Laertes' roles, and adds additional characters such as Othello, and Peter Quince from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Quince replaces the acting troupe from Hamlet, and is one of the few characters that is aware of Ophelia's time loop. Several characters have also been adapted for the game, making Rosencrantz and Guildenstern female and Ophelia and Laertes are biracial with experience of racial discrimination. A lady-in-waiting named Brit and a cook round out a more gender balanced cast.  \n## Development  \n<ImageHere>In Hamlet, Ophelia has no agency and drowns herself at the end of act 4, making her an apt choice as the player character in Elsinore.\nTeam lead and writer Katie Chironis and game designer Connor Fallon originally met in Carnegie Mellon University's Game Creation Society. Development of Elsinore began in 2010. Chironis and Fallon originally created Elsinore as part of a game jam, scrapped the project entirely, and then decided to create it from the ground up again. Chironis was inspired to make a Hamlet game by both her high school Shakespeare teacher and from the college writing classes she took at Carnegie Mellon. Chironis and Fallon wanted to create a game that would have a tragic story but in an interactive medium, eschewing the \"power fantasy\" games that are commonly created. By combining the tragedy of the play with the goal of \"winning\" games, the development team thought they could have a fresh take on Hamlet.  \nChironis and Fallon created their company, Golden Glitch, with five others that had been part of the Game Creation Society, and worked on the project during nights and weekends while keeping their day jobs. The founders received no payment until after the game went on sale, and the team's four contractors were paid from their personal salaries from their other jobs. In 2015, Golden Glitch created a Kickstarter for Elsinore, which was successfully funded and raised over $32,000. Despite an original targeted release date of September 2016, the game was not released until 2019.  \nThe Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask provided inspiration for how to implement time loops in the game, and Golden Glitch drew inspiration from anime and visual novels which had many examples of time loops as a plot mechanic. Golden Glitch decided to focus on Ophelia as the protagonist because of her lack of agency in Hamlet. Her early exit by suicide in the play means that she is uninvolved in much of the action that comes later on, and it gave the development team room to try to make her a stronger character. The team also decided to make Opheila a woman of color, and created her with the idea that she was of Moorish descent through her mother's line. The writers believed that this modification and some others allowed them to ensure that all of the characters had more fleshed out and unique storylines.\n\n## Reception  \nPraise for the game was centered especially on the writing, and the mostly perceived success of adapting Hamlet towards a video game medium. Wireds Julie Muncy praised Elsinore for its \"beautiful writing\" and \"humanistic flourishes\". The Los Angeles Timess Todd Martens commented positively on the game's parallels with modern experiences. Polygons Cass Marshall compared the game positively to Long Live the Queen, but noted that unlike in that game, Elsinores mechanics meant that progress always felt positive, praising the deep levels of character that can be explored. GameSpots Phil Hornshaw listed the game in GameSpots \"Best of 2019: Editor's Spotlight Awards\" and praised the game for being full of \"well-executed ideas\".  \nCriticism for the game's long waiting periods was tempered by feelings on the overall game. Kotakus Heather Alexandra noted that the slow pace \"wouldn't be for everyone\" but felt that if players could make it through it, the game was a worthwhile experience. US Gamers Eric Van Allen noted that the waiting periods can \"grate\" after a while, but that the game was largely successful in creating a positive narrative experience.  \n### Accolades  \nThe game was nominated for \"Excellence in Design\" and \"Excellence in Narrative\" at the IGF Awards, and for \"Best Original Choral Composition\", \"Best Original Song\" with \"Fair as a Rose\", and \"Best Original Soundtrack Album\" at the 18th Annual G.A.N.G. Awards.\n\nQuestion: What unique gameplay mechanic is central to the video game \"Elsinore\" as depicted in the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA. Real-time combat system\nB.

It was through Clark that ApIvor became interested in serialism.  \nHis administrative skills never improved. In 1947, Peggy Glanville-Hicks, President of the United States branch of the ISCM, was forced to write sharply to him to protest about unanswered correspondence in which the Americans had asked that the ISCM Festival scheduled for June 1948 in Amsterdam be held as late as possible in the month, in order to allow them the chance to attend, given their existing university teaching commitments. In the event, the US branch withdrew from the festival, but Glanville-Hicks attended in her personal capacity.  \nIn 1948, for the BBC's Third Programme, Clark presented \"Turning Points in Twentieth-Century Music\", a series of eight programmes of his own creation, which looked at the composers Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Bart\u00f3k.  \nHe gave the Commemoration Speech before the London Opera Guild's 'Arnold Schoenberg Memorial Concert' on 16 December 1951.  \nIn 1953 Sir William Walton used his contacts to secure a Civil List pension for Clark.  \nIn 1955, Benjamin Frankel succeeded Clark as Chairman of the ISCM. That year issues arose about certain expenses Clark had claimed while he was Chairman. Clark alleged that Frankel had falsely accused him of fraud. Frankel denied he had ever made any such claim, but nevertheless said that such a claim, had he made it, would have been true. This amounted to slander as far as Clark was concerned, and he sued Frankel in the High Court. As part of the arguments, various allegations of communist sub-plots were given an airing. While Frankel's alleged slander itself was unproven, the jury exonerated Clark of any wrongdoing and he felt this meant his integrity was intact. Elisabeth Lutyens ever after referred to Frankel as \"composer and ex-colleague\".  \nIn 1960 and 1961 he used his influence to have Denis ApIvor's opera Yerma broadcast by the BBC after the Sadler's Wells Theatre refused to mount the production (even though it had been commissioned by the Sadler's Wells Trust). It was conducted by Sir Eugene Goossens.  \nEdward Clark died suddenly of a coronary thrombosis in London on 30 April 1962, aged 73. Stravinsky wept on hearing of Clark's death.  \n## Honours  \nIn 1951 the Internationale Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Neue Musik (IGNM) awarded Edward Clark the Arnold Schoenberg Medal.  \nClark is one of a select band of Honorary Members of the ISCM.  \n## Works dedicated to Edward Clark  \n* John Ireland's Piano Sonatina (1926\u201327) and a numberdate=April 2015 from his cycle Songs Sacred and Profane (1929).  \n* Alan Bush's Dance Overture for Military Band (1930).  \n* J\u00f3zef Koffler, the first Polish twelve-tone composer, dedicated his \"Variations on a Waltz by Johann Strauss\", Op. 23 (1935) \"\u00c0 mon ami Edward Clark\".  \n* Anton Webern's orchestration of the Ricercare from Johann Sebastian Bach's The Musical Offering  \n* Elisabeth Lutyens' first truly serial composition, the Chamber Concerto No. 1, was completed in 1939, the year after she and Clark became partners, and she dedicated it to him.  \n* Humphrey Searle wrote a musical palindrome for Clark, his Quartet for clarinet, bassoon, violin and viola, Op. 12.  \n* Constant Lambert's Trois pi\u00e8ces n\u00e8gres pour les touches blanches, for piano 4-hands (1949).  \n* After his death, Elisabeth Lutyens dedicated Music for Orchestra II (1962) to his memory. However, it had been sketched well before Clark's death, and she denied the chorale ending was in any way a tribute to him. But she did acknowledge she had made an annotation at bars 184\u2013185 of the score, marking the moment of Clark's death.  \n## Personal life  \n### Dorothy Stephen  \nOn 10 August 1921 he married Frances Dorothy (\"Dolly\") Stephen (18 December 1893 \u2013 1971), who was related to the literary Stephen family (including Sir Leslie Stephen and his daughter Virginia Woolf). Clark's and Dolly's son James Royston Clark was born in 1923. Dolly left him in the summer of 1925, taking James with her.  \n#### The Eckersley affair  \nDolly later went to work for the BBC as a secretary, and had an affair with Clark's colleague, the engineer Peter Eckersley. This seemed to have Clark's blessing, as on one occasion he even arranged for Eckersley to visit Germany on BBC business, and for Dolly to accompany him. Eckersley was married, but although he and Dolly made no secret of their liaison, his wife Stella was unaware. It was Muriel Reith, the wife of the BBC Director-General John Reith, who broke the news to her. John Reith was strictly puritanical about such matters (although his own private life was questionable), and he was most unwilling to have a senior staff member on the payroll who was known to be conducting an adulterous affair or in the process of divorcing his own wife. Top level conferences were held; the Archbishop of Canterbury was even consulted. However, Eckersley was not sacked immediately, as he undertook to end the affair with Dolly Clark and return to his wife. But nature took its course, he and Dolly reunited, and he resigned in April 1929. The Eckersley affair prompted a public enquiry into the BBC's personnel practices.  \nDolly Clark and Peter Eckersley were married on 25 October 1930.  \n#### Dolly Eckersley's German sojourn  \nShe had always been very much pro-Nazi in her politics. She was known as a strongly pro-German fascist and a fanatical admirer of Adolf Hitler. She was a friend of William Joyce (\"Lord Haw-Haw\") and Unity Mitford, and a member of Arnold Leese's Imperial Fascist League. Peter Eckersley himself held similar opinions. After they met Sir Oswald Mosley, he became involved in his New Party, chairing its London Central Committee. He travelled throughout Europe constantly in a quest to expand the reach of international radio broadcasts; he claimed there were no sinister political motives behind his activities, but that they were simply his attempt to make himself very rich. From November 1939 the transmitter he had arranged to put in place at Osterloog transmitting station, which became the vehicle for William Joyce's broadcasts to Britain and Europe. Joyce was later hanged for treason, and Eckersley has been described as \"at best a foolish Fascist fellow traveller and at worst a traitor\". As for Dolly, she joined Mosley's British Union of Fascists, but outdid Mosley in her enthusiasm for the Nazi concept of fascism. She also joined the National Socialist League, which had been founded by William Joyce after he was expelled by Mosley for being too anti-semitic.  \nThe Eckersleys took their holidays in Germany a number of times, and attended the Nuremberg rallies in 1937 and 1938. In July 1939 Dorothy took her and Edward Clark's 16-year-old son James to a Nuremberg rally, and also attended the Salzburg Festival. She had a chance encounter with William Joyce in August and got him a job as a radio announcer and scriptwriter. When Britain declared war in September, she felt no need to return to her own country but decided to stay. James was enrolled in a German school, and gained \"a very favourable impression of Germany under Nazi rule\". In December 1939 she commenced work for the radio station Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (RRG), a propaganda machine for Joseph Goebbels. She was initially employed as an English-language announcer and later on office duties. James, although only aged 16, was taken out of school to also be a newsreader there. He changed his name to Richard, to sound less Jewish and more Wagnerian. He worked there on and off until July 1942; she continued until January 1943. For obscure reasons they were arrested by the Gestapo in December 1944 and incarcerated till the end of the war. They were liberated by the British, but promptly re-arrested. They were both tried in London in October 1945 for assisting the enemy by broadcasting. Dorothy was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison. James, still only 22, pleaded he had been hypnotised as an impressionable youth by the trappings and tricks of Nazi propaganda; this was accepted, and he was bound over for two years.  \nDorothy Eckersley died in 1971. James Clark became an editor and translator and died in 2012.  \n### Elisabeth Lutyens  \nIn 1938 Edward Clark met the composer Elisabeth Lutyens, who was married to the baritone Ian Glennie. She and Clark quickly became lovers, and later that year she left Glennie for Clark, taking her and Glennie's three children (a son and twin daughters) with her. In 1941 Clark gave her a fourth child (a son, Conrad) before marrying her on 9 May 1942.  \nTheir son Conrad Clark became a sculptor, designer and painter; he moved to Australia and now lives in Melbourne.  \n## Premieres conducted by Edward Clark  \n### World premieres  \n* Arnold Bax:  \n* * The Bard of the Dimbovitza, song cycle with orchestra, original version, 8 April 1921, Queen's Hall, Ethel Fenton (mezzo-soprano)  \n* Arthur Bliss  \n* * The Tempest, storm music, 8 April 1921, Queen's Hall, Harriet Cohen (pianist)  \n* * Rout, soprano and orchestra, 6 May 1921, Aeolian Hall  \n* Arnold Schoenberg:  \n* * Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht, orchestral version, December 1924, Newcastle upon Tyne  \n* * Cello Concerto in D (transcription of Keyboard Concerto in D by Georg Matthias Monn), studio broadcast, 3 or 5 February 1933, Antoni Sala (cello), BBC Symphony Orchestra  \n### British premieres  \n* Frederick Delius:  \n* * first broadcast performance of In a Summer Garden  \n* * first broadcast performance of North Country Sketches  \n* * first broadcast performance of Legende for violin and orchestra (1924;

The three teams faced off in a three team elimination match on August 23 at SummerSlam, which was won by Team PCB. At the 2015 Tribute to the Troops in December, Team B.A.D. and Paige defeated Brie Bella, Charlotte, Fox, and Lynch in an eight-woman tag team match. On the February 1, 2016, episode of Raw, Banks left the team, which caused Naomi and Tamina to attack her. Naomi and Tamina later lost to Banks and Lynch in a tag team match at Fastlane. On the WrestleMania 32 pre-show, Naomi and Tamina teamed up with Lana, Emma, and Summer Rae in a 10-Diva tag team match against Brie Bella, Paige, Fox, Eva Marie, and Natalya, where Naomi's team was defeated. In early May, Naomi became inactive due to a torn ankle tendon.\n\n#### SmackDown Women's Champion (2016\u20132017)  \nNaomi was drafted to the SmackDown brand on July 19 as part of the 2016 WWE draft. She then debuted a new gimmick, which included a new look and entrance, dubbed \"The Glow\". On August 21 at SummerSlam, Naomi competed in a six-woman tag team match alongside Becky Lynch and Carmella against Natalya, Alexa Bliss, and Nikki Bella, where Naomi's team was defeated after Bella pinned Carmella. On September 11 at Backlash, Naomi competed in a six-pack elimination challenge to determine the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion, where she would eliminate Bliss before she herself was eliminated by Natalya. On November 20, Naomi competed as part of the SmackDown women's team against the Raw women's team at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, where Naomi's team was defeated.  \nAfter two months of inactivity, Naomi returned on the January 24, 2017, episode of SmackDown, in a confrontation against SmackDown Women's Champion Bliss. On February 12, she competed against Bliss at Elimination Chamber, where she was victorious, becoming the SmackDown Women's Champion for the first time in her career as well as the first African-American woman to capture the title. The following Tuesday, she relinquished the title due to a legitimate injury she sustained during the match. On April 2, Naomi made her in-ring return in a six-pack challenge in her hometown of Orlando at WrestleMania 33, where she made Bliss submit, successfully regaining the SmackDown Women's Championship. Two days later, Naomi defeated Bliss in a rematch to retain the championship.  \nOn June 18, Naomi defeated Lana to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship at Money in the Bank. She then went on to retain the title over Lana two more times on the June 27 and July 4 episodes of SmackDown, the latter of which involved a seven-second submission victory. In June, Naomi debuted a customized title belt with glow-in-the-dark lights of various colors. On August 20 at SummerSlam, Naomi dropped the SmackDown Women's Championship to Natalya, ending her reign at 140 days. On November 19 at Survivor Series, Naomi competed in a five-on-five elimination tag team match, where she eliminated Raw team captain Alicia Fox, before she herself was eliminated by Sasha Banks, with her team ultimately losing the match.  \n#### Various storylines and departure (2018\u20132022)  \nOn January 28, 2018, Naomi competed in the inaugural women's Royal Rumble match at the namesake pay-per-view, entering at number 20 and lasting 06:49 before she was eliminated by Nia Jax. On the WrestleMania 34 kick-off show, Naomi went on to win the inaugural WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal by eliminating Bayley. In June, Naomi competed in her first Money in the Bank ladder match at the namesake pay-per-view, won by Alexa Bliss. On October 28, she took part in the first all-women's pay-per-view, Evolution, competing in a women's battle royal match, which was won by Jax. In November at Survivor Series, she competed in a traditional elimination tag team match as part of Team SmackDown, where she was the first woman eliminated from the match by Tamina.  \nNaomi then entered a feud with Mandy Rose after Rose started flirting with Naomi's real-life husband, Jimmy Uso, to \"ruin Naomi's life\", which involved Rose hinting at kissing Uso as well as Naomi attacking Rose in a hotel room to which Rose invited Uso. At Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019, Naomi and Rose eliminated each other during the women's Royal Rumble match. The two exchanged victories over each other in February. That same month, Naomi teamed up with Carmella in a six-team Elimination Chamber match for the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Championship at the namesake pay-per-view, where they were the first team eliminated. During the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up on April 15, Naomi was drafted to the Raw brand. She unsuccessfully competed in the women's Money in the Bank ladder match at the namesake pay-per-view the following month.  \nAt Royal Rumble on January 26, 2020, Naomi returned from a hiatus by entering the Royal Rumble match at number 18, lasting 22 minutes before being eliminated by Shayna Baszler. She later attributed her time away to health issues and a relative's death. The following month, Naomi lost to Bayley in a match for the SmackDown Women's Championship at Super Showdown. In April at WrestleMania 36, Naomi competed in a five-way elimination match for the same title, during which she was eliminated by Sasha Banks. In September, she underwent surgery to remove a fibroid.  \nAs part of the 2020 WWE Draft in October, Naomi was drafted back to the Raw brand. She returned at Royal Rumble in January 2021 during the 30-woman Royal Rumble match, entering at number 2, where she was eliminated by Shayna Baszler and Nia Jax. She teamed with Lana to compete in a tag team turmoil match during the first night of WrestleMania 37 to determine the No. 1 contenders for the Women's Tag Team Championship, where the duo was defeated. In August 2021, Naomi became part of the SmackDown roster. She subsequently began a feud with Sonya Deville, who was an authority figure. The feud developed due to Naomi's persistence in asking for matches, irritating Deville. Naomi and Deville eliminated each other from the Royal Rumble match at the namesake event in January 2022. Naomi teamed up with Ronda Rousey to defeat Deville and Charlotte Flair at Elimination Chamber the next month.  \nOn the second night of WrestleMania 38, Naomi teamed with Sasha Banks to compete in a four-way tag team match for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, in which they defeated the respective teams of Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley, Natalya and Shayna Baszler, and titleholders Carmella and Queen Zelina to become the new WWE Women's Tag Team Champions. During the May 16 episode of Raw, Naomi and Banks legitimately walked out of the show's venue over a creative dispute after a meeting with CEO Vince McMahon. This caused a change to the show's main event that originally involved both women. Naomi and Banks consequently received indefinite suspensions, and the title was vacated. In March 2023, Naomi stated she was no longer with WWE.  \n### Impact Wrestling (2023\u2013present)  \nOn April 28, 2023, Fatu made her Impact Wrestling debut during the tapings of Impact!, which aired on tape delay on May 4, under the ring name Trinity.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\nContext:\n# Women of Salerno  \nThe women of Salerno, also referred to as the ladies of Salerno and the Salernitan women (mulieres Salernitanae), are a group of women physicians who studied in medieval Italy, at the Schola Medica Salernitana, one of the first medical schools to allow women.  \n<ImageHere>A miniature depicting the Schola Medica Salernitana from a copy of Avicenna's Canons\n\n\n## Introduction  \nThese women practiced medicine, and were known to both teach and to publish medical works. Additionally, there is evidence that the study of female diseases was not their only interest, but they studied, taught, and practiced all branches of medicine, indeed multiple references attest to the vital role they played in surgical and scientific achievements.date=May 2022  \nIt has been possible for them to assert themselves within Salerno thanks to a climate of great tolerance that extended itself from women practitioners as well as Jews and Arabs. In addition, during most of its lifetime, Salerno was the only medical school in Europe that opened its doors to women  \n## Women in medieval southern Italy and Salerno  \n<ImageHere>Miniature depicting the Schola Medica Salernitana\nIn medieval southern Italy, Salerno was, in the 11th century, a \"city of extraordinary wealth and splendor for its trade, in which it had supplanted Amalfi and Gaeta. There were cedars, almonds, coated walnuts, imperial drapes, fine gold ornaments; wine, nuts, fruit, trees and crops abounded. Beautiful palaces adorned it; attractive women and upright men lived there\" ( Guglielmo di Puglia, 1090). In this political, social and cultural background, the women shared the deeds of men, participated in battles and exercised the medical art, as doctor or not. Intellectual openness excluded dogmas and confronted with the daily practice of dialogue and experience, with the comparison of Greek, Latin, Arab texts that were studied without prejudices or hierarchies of value. In this climate, accepting women as students and even more as teachers seemed natural and important. Indeed, the remedies used by women are appreciated and welcomed in the writings of the\u00a0Schola Medica Salernitana. Matteo Plateario (1140-1180) mentioned the women of Salerno and their remedies in his Liber De Semplici Medicina.\n\n## Studies and methodologies  \nThe women of Salerno were free to talk about sexual topics without moralisms or religious conditioning. In addition, their writings were some of the first to talk about menstruation.  \nDuring the early years of 1000s, people were already talking about fundamental modern values, such as prevention and healthy eating, as a base for medical treatments. The Mulieres Salernitanae preferred treatments like aromatized baths, therapies with herbs and massages, and there are no traces in their history of prayers or other supernatural methods in order to treat diseases.  \nGenerally, Trota's and the other women's writings were the first studies on the female body in medicine.  \nFundamental for them was the history of the patient, in order to identify the right therapy. Reading their works shows that they were not only deeply acquainted with the female body, but also had a high knowledge of plants and the benefits of herbs. They were innovative in many respects, considered prevention fundamental, proposed unusual methods for the time, stressed the importance of hygiene, a balanced diet, physical activity, their advices included baths and massages, decoctions, bloodletting. They had no fear of revealing truths never told and to solve problems never solved, their lessons were taught with extreme naturalness of sexuality, contraception using a simple language accessible to all. Their students were able to differentiate between typhoid and malaria, they could calculate fever temperatures and estimate recovery times, and they could treat complex wounds with appreciable chances of success.  \n## Allegations of witchcraft  \nThere were also many rumours about the mulieres salernitanae: as an example, Arnaldo da Villanova, a Spanish scientist, explained that women of Salerno drank mysterious potions during gestation and for this reason women grew aberrant, accompanying the recitation of the Pater noster with a mysterious magic formula:  \nThese rumors were born due to the fact that, despite the wealth and intellectual openness of the city of Salerno, the early medieval era also represented the start of prejudice towards women and the theory of feminine inferiority. Jules Michelet (1862) stated that \u201cthe only doctor of the people, for a thousand years, was the Witch\u201d.  \nDespite these rumors of discredit, however, their fame grew, not only in Italy but also beyond the Alps.  \n## Notable women of Salerno  \nThese women included:  \n* Trota of Salerno \u2013 The most famous of the women of Salerno, Trota is believed to have lived during the 11th or 12th century. She had long been believed to be \"Trotula of Salerno\", the author of a 3-part book about medical treatments for women, De curis mulierum (\"On Treatments for Women\"). However, recent discoveries indicate she was likely only the author of one third of this compendium.  \n* Constance Calenda (15th century) \u2013 Lectured on medicine and was eventually a professor at the University of Naples.  \n* Rebecca Guarna \u2013 Published works on \"Fevers, De febrius\" the \"Urine, De Urinis\" and the \"Embryo, De embrione\".  \n* Abella \u2013 Published works on \"Black Bile\" and \"Nature of Seminal Fluid\"  \n* Maria Incarnata  \n* Mercuriade \u2013 Published works on \"Crises\", \"Pestilent Fever, De Febre Pestilenti\", and \"The Cure of Wounds, De Curatio\"  \nThe first to remember the women of Salerno is a historian from Salerno, Antonio Mazza, prior of the School of Medicine in the seventeenth century, who in the essay \"Historiarum epitome de rebus salernitanis\" writes \"We have many learned women, who in many fields surpassed or equalled by ingenuity and doctrine many men and, like men, were remarkable in the field of medicine\". Among the most famous women who attended the school of Salerno was Francesca Cenci, wife of Matteo Romano Cenci, who received a degree in medicine and surgery from Carlo D\u2019Angi\u00f2, Duke of Calabria, in 1321. Abella, from the noble family of Castellaneta, wrote \u201cDe atrabile\u201d and \u201cDe nature seminis humani\u201d, of which, unfortunately, any trace has been lost. Rebecca de Guarna specialized in the study and treatment of urinary diseases and fevers. Mercuriade, surgeon, wrote many didactic essays: \u201cLe crisi\u201d, \u201cLa febbre da pestilenza\u201d, \u201cLa cura delle ferite\u201d.  The most known of the women of Salerno is Trota, who was a Magistra of Medicine at the School of Salerno and ran a prolific clinical practice. She taught her students about three types of diseases: inherited, contagious, and self-generated, and this type of teaching was carried on by all the other women.  \n## Contributions  \nOne of the most important contributions of the women of Salerno is a textbook that was widely distributed throughout Europe. The textbook, \u201cDe Passionibus Mulierum ante in et post partum\u201d, that witnesses the birth of obstetrics and gynecology as science, was first published around 1100 AD and then it was completely\u00a0 revised by Ambrose Par\u00e9's assistants in the early 17th century. Also Paley, one of the greatest anatomist of his time, stated that many of his important anatomical and surgical considerations came directly or indirectly from the work of Salerno women. He advances that Salerno women first documents, thoughts and practices are an interesting and important part of our surgical heritage.  \nThe work begins by outlining the characteristic nature of the female gender, which, unlike the nature of the male, hot and dry, is rather cold and humid. So, lacking women the heat necessary to dissipate bad moods, their diseases were more frequent and mainly affect the reproductive organs. To defend themselves from moods women have a particular purification, the menstruation, whose regularity is a source and sign of health. The first task of the doctor is then to diagnose the reasons for the interruption of the regularity or scarcity of the menstruation and to identify with the pharmacopoeia the appropriate remedies.  \nPerineal tears and uterine tears are common wounds often experienced by midwives, giving Trotula and her students ample opportunity to develop new techniques and remedies for wound healing.  \nThe anatomy of the reproductive organs was known only through animal anatomy and written descriptions in Islamic texts. Salerno female physicians made an important contribution on this subject because female physicians had greater access to female patients than their male colleagues. They deepened the study of the female body, coming to theorize that infertility could also depend on men and not only women.  \n## Bibliography  \n* * Alaina Ferraris BA, Zoe, Ferraris, Victor A.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\n<ImageHere>Yahtzee, the dice game that the group begin to play.\nTroy and Abed invite their study group to a housewarming party. After Abed presents his Raiders of the Lost Ark boulder diorama, the group begin playing Yahtzee. Jeff rolls a die to determine which of the group must collect the pizza delivery, numbering starting from his left. Abed claims that Jeff is creating six different \"timelines\" by rolling the die.  \nJeff rolls so that Annie (Alison Brie) gets the pizza. As Pierce (Chevy Chase) claims he had sex with Eartha Kitt, Britta (Gillian Jacobs) is stopped from singing along to \"Roxanne\" (1978) by Jeff. Troy finds a gun in Annie's bag. Pierce tries to give Troy a present. Jeff hurts his head on the ceiling fan. Annie returns, calling the pizza guy a creep. Similar scenes subsequently arise when the scene is restarted, Jeff rolling a different number each time. It arises that the group thinks Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) has a baking problem and Pierce's gift is a Norwegian troll that scares Troy. Other recurring scenes include Abed catching the rolling diorama boulder, Britta smoking marijuana, and Annie inspecting Jeff's head injury.  \nWhen Shirley gets the pizza, the group let her pies burn, so she insults them and exits. When Pierce leaves, Troy unloads to Britta about Jeff making him feel immature. When Britta leaves, Pierce torments Troy with the troll; Britta returns engaged to the pizza guy. \"The Darkest Timeline\" arises when Troy leaves. Annie trips over the diorama boulder, flipping a table. Her gun discharges and shoots Pierce in the leg. Britta drops a joint, starting a fire. Troy returns to find the troll staring at him amid the chaos. When Abed leaves, Shirley learns Britta smoked marijuana, Troy becomes furious at Pierce, and Jeff and Annie kiss, then fight; everyone but Abed is unhappy. In a seventh timeline, Abed catches the die and exposes Jeff's plan: there are seven people and the die is six-sided, so Jeff never has to collect the pizza. The group make him do so and dance to \"Roxanne\". Abed suggests that Annie move into the apartment.  \nThe end tag shows the Darkest Timeline: Shirley is an alcoholic; Pierce died; Annie was sent to a mental health ward; Jeff lost an arm in the fire; Troy lost his larynx trying to eat the troll; Britta put a blue streak in her hair. Abed makes felt goatees for the remaining group members, suggesting that they become evil and try to journey to the main timeline.\n\n## Production  \nThis episode was Chris McKenna's sixth writing credit for Community.  \n\"Remedial Chaos Theory\" was broadcast as the fourth episode of the third season. The episode premiered on NBC on October 13, 2011, a Thursday 8p.m. timeslot. It was written by Chris McKenna, his sixth writing credit of the series. The writers used annotated diagrams, or \"story circles\", one for each character per timeline, displaying the character's actions in that timeline; series creator Dan Harmon later published images of them on Tumblr. The episode was directed by Jeff Melman.  \nThe episode was originally intended to air as the third episode, but was delayed a week because the episode still needed to be completed, including editing, reshoots, and visual effects. Series creator Dan Harmon wrote that this was his decision, which broadcaster NBC agreed to. A number of jokes from this episode are cited in the episode \"Competitive Ecology\", which was the actual third episode to air due to the re-ordering. In \"Competitive Ecology\", Pierce mentions his Eartha Kitt story and Shirley references Britta's marijuana usage. A consequence of the re-ordering was that two consecutive episodes, \"Geography of Global Conflict\" and \"Competitive Ecology\", had similar B-plots involving Chang (Ken Jeong) and his security guard storyline. Additionally, the re-ordering meant that the episode following this, \"Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps\", became the second episode in a row to feature seven different stories. The opening lines of \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", in which Britta and Annie dispute whether the apartment number is 303 or 304, is a reference to the re-ordering.  \nPrior to Harmon announcing that the episodes had been reordered, some fans and critics noticed inconsistencies between \"Competitive Ecology\" and \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", speculating that the final timeline shown in this episode was not the one that would be followed in future episodes. Harmon commented that the canonical timeline which other episodes continue on from is the final one shown, where Abed prevents the die from landing on a number, saying that no ambiguity was intended.  \nThe song \"Roxanne\" by The Police plays briefly in several timelines and for a lengthier period in the final one. According to Harmon on audio commentary, licensing of this song used up much of the music budget for the whole third season, leading to the frequent use of \"Daybreak\" by Michael Haggins and Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's score for the series in the season's other episodes. However, McHale later said that Harmon often purchased music if the studio refused to, and gave \"Roxanne\" as an example.  \n## Themes  \n\"Remedial Chaos Theory\" is a concept episode. Some critics commented that there was an absence of an overarching plot. Storylines play out across timelines, such as Pierce being jealous that Troy moves out of his mansion to live with Abed. Other details like Troy and Abed putting a bowl of olives by their toilet occur repeatedly.  \n<ImageHere>When Troy, played by Donald Glover, leaves to get the pizza, a series of disasters ensues; this is referred to as \"The Darkest Timeline\".\nCritics found that each timeline shows how the absence of any member of the group would significantly disrupt or affect the others, variously interpreting each timeline. The \"Darkest Timeline\" arises when Troy leaves the group to get the pizza. Critics have commented that this indicates that Troy is the group's linchpin, without whom the group descends into chaos, or that Troy should be the leader of the group rather than Jeff. Some critics found that Annie has a caretaker role, despite struggling to take care of herself, whilst Shirley is a mother figure as the other characters do not take responsibility for their actions. Joshua Kurp of Vulture opined that without Pierce, Jeff feels insecure about being the oldest. Others found that Troy tries to act mature around Britta, and wants Jeff to view him as an adult, but is immature when just with Abed. In regards to Abed, it was suggested that his meta-commentary on the group allows them to confront their issues. Though Jeff's consistent interruption of Britta as she tries to sing \"Roxanne\" initially seems like a joke on her, it is a joke at the expense of Jeff, as the rest of the group happily join in when he is the one to get the pizza. According to some critics, the group would be better off without Jeff.  \nCommentary was made on the episode's allusions to other media, and its usage of props. Similar to the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day, in which a character is repeatedly woken up to the same song to indicate the same day occurring over and over again, \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" uses a song\u2014\"Roxanne\" by The Police\u2014to mark the start of a new timeline. The Darkest Timeline was compared to the Star Trek episode \"Mirror, Mirror\", in which characters battle evil versions of themselves. Annie's gun is a Smith & Wesson, which David Mello of Screen Rant reported would not discharge in the way depicted in the Darkest Timeline. Pierce's Serbian rum has a Cyrillic label reading \"generic rum\". Some of Abed's bedroom decorations, such as a Kickpuncher poster, were previously shown in his season one college accommodation.  \nLater episodes drew on plot points from \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", such as the Darkest Timeline, which the episode also popularized as a pop culture phrase. Evil Abed reappears briefly in the season three episodes \"Contemporary Impressionists\" and the finale \"Introduction to Finality\". In the former, Abed briefly hallucinates Evil Abed, and in the latter he begins to act as Evil Abed when it looks like he will lose Troy as a friend. The fourth season finale, \"Advanced Introduction to Finality\", has a storyline built around the evil characters from the Darkest Timeline invading the canonical timeline. In the end tag of that episode, Evil Troy and Evil Abed host \"Troy and Abed in the Morning\" with Chang and visit the \"5\" timeline.\n\n## Reception  \n### Ratings  \nIn its original broadcast on October 13, 2011, the episode was viewed by an estimated 3.82\u00a0million people, up 13 percent from the previous week. It had a Nielsen rating of 1.7 in the 18\u201349 demographic. After factoring in seven-day DVR viewership, the episode received a 2.4 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic.  \n### Critical reviews  \nWhilst critical reception to the first three episodes of the season were generally lukewarm, \"Remedial Chaos Theory\" received critical acclaim, and remains a favorite episode amongst both fans and critics. Reviews at the time include an A rating in The A.V. Club, a rating of ten out of ten in IGN and a rating of 4.5 out of five stars in TV Fanatic. Adam Quigley of /Film found it the best episode of the program up to that point. Critics praised the episode's structure and the show's return to a high-concept episode. Kelsea Stahler of Hollywood.com praised that after the first three episodes of the season, the show revisited \"experimental, high-concept television laced with absurd comedy\".  \nAspects of the episode highlighted for praise included the attention to detail and intricacy in the alternate timelines. Emily St. James of The A.V. Club praised the episode as simultaneously \"silly, moving and revelatory\". The episode's end tag and Darkest Timeline scene were received positively. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly found that the episode was well-acted by each cast member. Alan Sepinwall of Hitfix praised the episode for its detailed depiction of the relationship between each of the characters in the group. Sepinwall further praised the episode's humor.

Since opening in 1969, it has held at least two NASCAR races. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosted USAC and the Verizon IndyCar Series. The track features one layout, a km concrete oval, with 24\u00b0 banking in the turns and 9\u00b0 banking on the straights. The speedway is owned and operated by Dover Motorsports.  \nThe track, nicknamed \"The Monster Mile\", was built in 1969 by Melvin Joseph of Melvin L. Joseph Construction Company, Inc., with an asphalt surface, but was replaced with concrete in 1995. Six years later in 2001, the track's capacity moved to 135,000 seats, making the track have the largest capacity of sports venue in the mid-Atlantic. In 2002, the name changed to Dover International Speedway from Dover Downs International Speedway after Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment split, making Dover Motorsports. From 2007 to 2009, the speedway worked on an improvement project called \"The Monster Makeover\", which expanded facilities at the track and beautified the track. After the 2014 season, the track's capacity was reduced to 95,500 seats.\n\n#### Entry list  \n## First practice  \nKyle Larson was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 21.892 seconds and a speed of abbr=on.  \n## Qualifying  \nQualifying for Friday was cancelled due to rain and Kyle Busch, the point leader, was awarded the pole as a result.  \n### Starting Lineup  \n## Practice (post-qualifying)  \n### Second practice  \nSecond practice session scheduled for Saturday was cancelled due to rain.  \n### Final practice  \nFinal practice  \nKyle Larson was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 22.640 seconds and a speed of abbr=on.  \n## Race  \n<ImageHere>Chase Elliott won the race.\nKyle Busch led the field to green, only to be passed by Kevin Harvick ten laps later. Harvick swept both stages. Harvick led until about 50 to go when he had a loose wheel. Aric Almirola inherited the lead from his mistake-cursed teammate. Almirola maintained the lead until a caution with ten to go, caused by a crashed SHR car of Clint Bowyer. Chase Elliott boldly opted not to pit, taking the lead. On the restart Elliott surfed ahead of Almirola, who would ultimately wreck with Brad Keselowski a half lap later, sending the race into overtime. At the restart, Elliott forged ahead of Denny Hamlin, a rival from Martinsville and Phoenix in 2017.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Unitary psychosis  \nUnitary psychosis (Einheitspsychose) refers to the 19th-century belief prevalent in German psychiatry until the era of Emil Kraepelin that all forms of psychosis were surface variations of a single underlying disease process. According to this model, there were no distinct disease entities in psychiatry but only varieties of a single universal madness and the boundaries between these variants were fluid. The prevalence of the concept in Germany during the mid-19th century can be understood in terms of a general resistance to Cartesian dualism and faculty psychology as expressed in Naturphilosophie and other Romantic doctrines that emphasised the unity of body, mind and spirit.  \n## 19th-century proponents  \n### Joseph Guislain  \n<ImageHere>paraphr\u00e9nie (folie); hyperplexie (stupidity); hyperspasmie (epilepsy); ideosynchysie (hallucinations); analcouthie (confusion); and noasth\u00e9nie (dementia).\n\n\n### Ernst Albrecht von Zeller  \nErnst Albrecht von Zeller (1804\u20131877)  \nGuislain's thesis was taken up by the German psychiatrist Ernst Albrecht von Zeller (1804\u20131877), who translated his text into German in 1837. Zeller was the medical director of a private asylum at Winnenthal in W\u00fcrttemberg. He would become perhaps the figure most associated with the concept of unitary psychosis in German psychiatry. In 1834 he had already declared that the different varieties of mental illness were simply differing stages in a common morbid process and that \"in the course of one case all the main forms of mental disorder may occur\". His adoption of the concept of unitary madness was predicated on his belief in the unity of the human soul or character and that man was at once composed of both material and spiritual elements. Deriving this belief in part from Naturphilosophie and the influence of anthropology on German psychiatric concepts, he held that it was this fundamental spiritual self that was afflicted in madness. For Zeller, both organic and moral (or psychological) causes combined to produce mental illness. The organic causes of mental illness were, he argued, observable in the physical illnesses that preceded its onset. He reasoned, however, that \"cases are rare in which the mental disorder is caused by purely organic problems of the central nervous system\". Instead, he held that the psychological pain occasioned by remorse, guilt, poverty and social reversal was the universal causal factor in all forms of mental morbidity. Somatic and moral factors and the pain attendant on the latter combined variously to produce the four stages of a universal disease: melancholia (the fundamental form of mental disorder which led to the other stages), mania, paranoia and, finally, dementia.  \n### Wilhelm Griesinger  \nWilhelm Griesinger (1817\u20131868)  \nFor a period of two years from 1840 Wilhelm Griesinger (1817\u20131868) worked as a medical assistant to Zeller at the Winnental Asylum. While there, he adopted and adapted his senior colleague's model of a unitary psychosis. He did not, however, shares Zeller's conviction regarding the nature of the human soul or character and its role in madness. A convinced somaticist and commonly considered one of the founders of materialist psychiatry, in the 1845 text which established him as one of the leading scientific psychiatrists of his era, Pathologie and Therapie der psychischen Krankheiten, he conceived of character, or \"psychological tonus\", as derived from the action of a postulated \"psychic reflex action\" (psychische Reflexaktion) produced by the stimulus of the accumulated representations (Vorstellungen) of the individual's life experience. The concept of psychic reflex action was drawn by analogy from the physiological reflex action of the nervous system in response to a stimulus and he argued that both forms of reflex had the same mode of action and obeyed the same physical laws.  Mental illnesses occurred, he posited, when the system of psychic reflex action failed to function correctly and were either diminished, leading to melancholia, or accelerated, leading to mania. His belief was that mental illness was a disease of the brain but that this in turn was caused by psychological factors. His emphasis on the brain as the central site of mental illness has led to his association with the so-called Somatiker (somaticists) who had argued that the causes of mental illness were entirely physical whereas their opponents, the Psychiker, insisted that mental disorders were the result of psychological perversions, moral failings, or diseases of the soul (Seelenkrankheit). As with Zeller, he postulated that melancholia constituted the primary form of mental illness which then passed to mania before terminating in dementia. In his 1861 text Mental Pathology and Therapeutics Griesinger proposed a classificatory division of types of mental anomalies between those characterised by emotional disturbances and those characterised by disturbances in the intellectual and volitional functions. He argued, based on his observation of cases, that the former condition preceded the latter where disorders of the intellect and will appeared \"only as consequences and terminations\" of disturbances of the emotions if \"the cerebral affliction has not been cured\". These two categories thus constituted, for Griesigner, \"the different forms and the different stages of one morbid process\". The general trajectory of this mental pathology tended towards \"a constant progressive course, which may even proceed to complete destruction of the mental life\". Greisinger maintained his belief in unitary psychosis until the 1860s.  \n### Heinrich Neumann  \nThe greatest defender and the most radical proponent of the concept of unitary psychosis in the 19th century was the German psychiatrist Heinrich Neumann (1814\u201388). Switching from general medicine to psychiatry in the 1850s, he became the owner of a private psychiatric clinic and from 1874 to 1884 he attained the post of medical director at a university-based clinical ward in the Breslau city hospital (now Wroclaw in Poland). He was succeeded by his former medical assistant, Carl Wernicke, a noted neuropsychiatrist. In his Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie (Textbook of Psychiatry) of 1859 he rejected any attempt at psychiatric classification as \"artificial\". He asserted that, \"There is only one type of mental disorder. We call it madness (Irresein). Insanity does not possess different forms but different stages; they are called insanity (Wahnsinn), confusion (Verwirrheit), and dementia (Bl\u00f6dsinn).\" Neumann exceeded the position of previous adherents of the unitarian concept by propounding not simply a continuum among diseases but also between disease and health. Thus, he argued that, \"sleeplessness, illusions, exaggerated sensitivity ... cause illness, then madness, confusion, and dementia\". The proposed mechanism underlying this process was what Neumann termed \"metamorphosis\" which referred to a disturbance in consciousness that led to errors in the interpretation of sensations. For Neumann an overabundance of stimulation produced mental irritation and mania. As this depleted mental energy it could then result in hallucinations. The medical historian Eric Engstrom has argued that Neumann's proposal to subsume the entire range of diverse psychiatric symptomatology into the concept of Einheitspsychose had the virtue of flexibility in its capacity to absorb any system of psychiatric classification. Engstom has also noted that the concept supported calls for the early committal to asylums of all potential patients as it did not link the likelihood of remission to disease classification but rather argued for early intervention to prevent the onset of chronic mental disability. Its wider support among asylum-based alienists (as medical practitioners in mental hospitals were then known) as opposed to academic psychiatrists was due to the fact that it was more applicable to the unhurried tempo of asylum routine where, unlike in university clinics, there was no perceived need for rapid diagnosis. Equally, medical formation in the asylum setting was focused on protracted clinical observation rather than the formal pedagogy of a standardised university curriculum.  \n## 19th-century critics  \n### Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum  \n<ImageHere>Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum (1828\u20131899)\nFrom the 1860s the concept of unitary psychosis and its advocates came under increasing criticism. Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum (1829\u20131899), a German psychiatrist of seminal importance in the development of the modern nosology and a formative influence on the work of Emil Kraepelin, had taken issue with Neumann's assertion in his 1859 text that mental illness could not be categorised into discrete disease entities. Kahlbaum fashioned a response in 1863 with the publication of his Die Gruppierung der psychischen Krankheiten (The Classification of Psychiatric Diseases). This text delineated four distinct types of mental illness (vesania): vesania acuta, vesania typica, vesania progressiva and vesania catatonica. He asserted that the unitarian position signalled the \"end to all diagnosis in the field of psychopathology.\" For Kahlbaum, Neumann's failure to engage in any attempt at disease classification, his rejection of diagnosis as abstraction and his focus only upon the individual manifestation of mental illness constituted an enterprise without any scientific validity. In the absence of meaningful and acute diagnostic categories in psychiatry Kahlbaum believed that both the development of effective therapeutic practices and the knowledge of mental illness would run stagnant.\n\n### Emil Kraepelin  \nDuring his inaugural lecture following his appointment to the chair of psychiatry in Dorpat University in 1887, Kraepelin contended that Zeller's notion of unitary psychosis had led to the calcification of clinical research in Germany until as late as the 1860s. The revival of a more objective clinical approach built upon observation, he contended, had had to await the contribution of researchers such as Ludwig Snell who wrote on monomania as a distinct disease entity in the 1870s. Kraepelin's approach to classification of mental illness was based on longitudinal studies of symptoms, course and outcome. He concluded from his studies that there were only two major forms of serious mental illness: dementia praecox and manic depression. This division of the psychoses, currently enshrined in modern classification systems as that between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and referred to as the Kraepelinian dichotomy, has remained in place for more than a hundred years.  \n## 20th-century revivals  \nKlaus Conrad (1905\u20131961)  \nVariations of the unitary psychosis thesis have been revived occasionally during the 20th century. These have generally taken the form of statistical analyses that purport to demonstrate that the Kraeplinian division is unstable. In the modern era the concept of schizoaffective psychosis, which straddles the Kraepelinian divide, when delineated as a condition sharing a common causal pathway as both schizophrenia and affective psychosis, shares aspects of the more radical notion of unitary psychosis in regarding the individual psychoses as points on a continuum.  \n### Klaus Conrad  \nKlaus Conrad (1905\u20131961), a German neuropsychiatrist and a member of the Nazi party from 1940, became convinced that there was only one endogenous psychosis based partly upon his observation that cyclothymic patients, or those suffering from affective psychosis, often sired schizophrenic children. He also held the belief, derived from his clinical experience, that symptoms associated with particular diagnostic categories were fluid and that a patient could, for instance, exhibit signs of mania or depression which might then reappear periodically and subsequently develop delusions and undergo a deterioration in personality. Likewise, symptoms thought to be characteristic of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations and catatonia, were, he alleged, also found in depression and mania. Conrad also contested the then established classificatory division between the endogenous and exogenous psychoses or, respectively, psychoses of internal or external origin, as whether the disease causing agent was \"physical exhaustion or heightened emotion\" it \"attacked the same structure, physiological mechanism, biological metabolism\". Conrad, a proponent of Gestalt psychology, is typically characterised as having expounded a view of psychosis that is commensurate with the mid-19th century psychiatric concept of unitary psychosis.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following individuals played a significant role in the development of modern psychiatric nosology and criticized the concept of unitary psychosis?\nChoice list: \nA.

He was expected to follow the family tradition of a career in the textile industry, but Kops was ambitious and wanted a more extensive education. For the moment he immersed himself in a study of Dutch literature and botany.  \nIn December 1781 Kops enrolled at the Amsterdam Theological Seminary, a move which was not his first choice, as he would rather have followed his interest in botany and natural history, but understood that these were not lucrative fields. Anabaptists, such as Kops, were systematically excluded from public office. However this did not deter Kops from attending courses in the natural sciences at the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam.  \nIn April 1787 Kops passed his examination at the Anabaptist seminary and served as pastor at Leiden until 1800, enrolling at the local university for a number of courses. In his spare time he was kept busy by his interest in literature.  \nA great setback in Kops' church career was his being passed over in 1792 as preacher for the Haarlem congregation, the same thing happening in Amsterdam. Kops was furious over this and sought diversion in botany. As a consequence the first part of \"Flora Batava\" appeared in 1800. The Batavian Revolution led to the Mennonites' being placed on equal footing with the Dutch Reformed Church, and in 1795 and 1796 he was a member and chairman of Leiden's local authority.  \nKops next turned his attention to agriculture, and looked into the possibility of turning the dune region into productive farmland. He assembled a panel of agricultural experts and approached the Provincial Administration of Holland, setting out his ideas. His proposals met with a favourable reception and in September 1796 a study group was put together with Kops as secretary, and a report soon followed. His reputation as agronomist firmly established by the report, he was appointed in June 1800 as director of agriculture in the Netherlands, causing him to leave the ministry in Leiden and take up an office at The Hague, a post he was to fill until 1815. In this new capacity Kops undertook a tour of five months through the Netherlands, enabling him to personally judge the state of the nation's agriculture. On his initiative the first Dutch agricultural magazine Magazijn van Vaderlandschen Landbouw appeared between 1803 and 1814. He also initiated the formation of 10 regional agricultural commissions to advise the government. In 1808 he established the first \"Agricultural Cabinet\" to provide farmers with assistance and advice on farming equipment and implements.  \nHis previous interests resurfaced and in 1815 he was appointed professor of botany and agricultural economics at the University of Utrecht, a position he would hold until 1835. In this period he also preached as minister from 1816 to 1843 to the Mennonites in Utrecht, The Hague and Amsterdam.  \n## Flora Batava  \nThe first issue of \"Flora Batava\" was published in Amsterdam in 1800, with illustrations that were provided by artists working under J. C. Sepp & Son. The publisher Jan Christiaan Sepp was not only a Mennonite, but also an engraver, etcher, bookseller, author and illustrator. The final issue, volume 28, was published in 1934. Willem Jan L\u00fctjeharms, the editor for that volume, stated that the work had ended and its publication had stretched over more years than any other botanical magazine. The work of text, illustrations and printing had changed hands many times during the course of its history. Several artists had produced the illustrations, but since the plates were unsigned, attribution is difficult. Most of the illustrations in the first three volumes were from the hand of (Georg Jacob Johann van Os), a flower and fruit painter for the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory.  \nKops chose the title of his work for historical reasons; \"Batavia\" was a region of the Netherlands when it still formed part of the Roman Empire. Flora Batava was the name given the garden of Agnes Block (1629-1704), an art collector and horticulturist. She was the daughter of a Mennonite textile merchant and after the death of her first husband she bought a country estate on the Vecht River in Loenen and named it Vijverhof. A procession of artists, including Maria Sibylla Merian, visited her home and left behind a large number of paintings of flowers from her garden.  \nKops married Catharina Daams (1768-1805) in January 1788, the marriage producing 6 sons and 5 daughters. After the death of Catharina in 1805, Kops was married in 1807 to Helena Biljouw (1774-1855). From this marriage came 5 sons and 1 daughter, 3 of the 5 sons dying young.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a plate from the journal \"Flora Batava\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1844.  \n## Early life  \nSt Mary's Bellevue, Edinburgh  \n<ImageHere>Henry Grey by Hill & Adamson\n\n<ImageHere>Henry Grey of Edinburgh by John Kay\n5 East Claremont Street, Edinburgh  \nGrey was born on 11 February 1778, at Alnwick, Northumberland. His father was a physician in Morpeth. His education was at a private school in Highhedgely with a final 18 months in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In Newcastle he attended lectures by Henry Moyes (on a tour of Britain) and was greatly influenced by his thinking. His mother had an early breach with his father, and after his education moved with her son to Edinburgh in 1793. There he passed through the usual course of study preparatory to entering into the office of the ministry in the Church of Scotland. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Edinburgh in November 1800. He was ordained in 1801.1890\n\n## Ministry  \nGrey's sympathies were wholly with the evangelical portion of the church.  \nIn September 1801 he was ordained as minister of the parish of Stenton in East Lothian. This was a quiet place, where he spent 12 years, including getting married and starting a family. In 1813 he was called to the Buccleuch Chapel in south Edinburgh - a charge recently formed by Rev Sir Wellwood-Moncrieff, as a Chapel of Ease to St. Cuthbert's parish to address the growing population inn south Edinburgh. Grey's discourses were presented in a scholarly style and fervent manner, leading the way for Andrew Mitchell Thomson and Thomas Chalmers.1890  \n### Apocrypha Controversy  \nHenry Grey and his wife  \nOn 11 January 1821 Grey was appointed to the New North Church, one of the four parish churches of Edinburgh contained within St Giles Cathedral, in place of the late Rev David Dickson. In October 1824 the town council chose Grey as minister of St Mary's Church in the Bellevue district (which was still under construction) and on completion in January 1825 he was therefore its first minister, his first service there being on the first Sunday after 13 January.  \nIn the lead up to the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, Grey had taken part in agitation against slavery in the West Indies.  \nFour years after this last change of post, Grey clashed with Andrew Thomson, and they took opposite sides in the Apocrypha Controversy; they had been warm personal friends.1890  \nIn the ecclesiastical struggle of the next few years, Grey opposed the civil courts. At the Disruption of 1843 he left the Church of Scotland and joined the Free Church of Scotland. Taking a large proportion of the Bellevue congregation with him, and had a new church built for him on the north side of Barony Street, 300m south of the original church. The building held a congregation of 800. This structure was short-lived, as it was not intended as the permanent home of the congregation. Although Grey was involved in the contract for the permanent building (on the corner of Albany street and Broughton Street) it was not completed until after Grey's death due to contractual problems.  \nIn 1844, Grey was chosen as the second Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church. In the jubilee year of his ministry, a public testimonial was presented to him, which was turned into a foundation for the Grey Scholarships in the New College, Edinburgh.1890 Grey's elders included David Octavius Hill.  \nA political reformer, he was the target of adverse criticism from some who agreed with his religious views.1890  \n## Death  \nThe grave of Rev Henry Grey DD, St Cuthberts Churchyard, Edinburgh  \nGrey retired from active ministry in 1857 with Free St Mary's being taken over by Rev Thomas Main.  \nGrey died suddenly in his eighty-first year, on Thursday 13 January 18591890 at his home 5 East Claremont Street, a very large Georgian flat on the eastern fringe of the Edinburgh New Town.  \nHe is buried in St Cuthbert's Churchyard at the west end of Princes Street with his wife Margaretta (1786\u20131858) and children Emily Isabella and George Edward Grey. The grave lies in the north-east corner of the northernmost section, abutting the churchyard of St John.  \n## Family  \nIn October 1808 he married his cousin Margaretta Grey (1786-1858) eldest daughter of his paternal uncle, Rev George Grey of West Ord in Northumberland. Their children included:  \n* Mary Grey (1810-1857) married Rev John Hampton Gurney, rector of St Mary's Church, Bryaston Square in London  \n* Harriet Jane Grey (1811-1863) married Rev Charles Birrell of Pembroke Baptist Church in Liverpool, parents to Augustine Birrell  \n* George Edward Grey (1812-1819)  \n* Rev Henry Campbell Grey (1814-1854) vicar of Watling, Sussex  \n* Emelia Isabella (1816-1843)  \n* Edward John Grey (1820-1869)  \n## Publications  \n* Two Sacraments of the Christian Church: Baptism and the Communion (1811)  \n* Catechism on Baptism (Edinburgh, 1811)  \n* Sermon on Behalf of the Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum (1815)  \n* The Diffusion of Christianity Dependent on the Exertions of Christians (1818)1818  \n* The Veil of Moses done away in Christ (1820)  \n* Man's Judgment at Variance with God's (1824)1824  \n* Review of Remarks Relative to his Connection with the Letters of Anglicanus Edinburgh, 1828)  \n* The Duty and Desirableness of Frequent Communion with Christ in the Sacrament of the Supper (Edinburgh, 1832)  \n* Address to the Congregation of St Mary's (Edinburgh, 1843)1843  \n* A Parting Memorial (Edinburgh, 1858)1858  \n* Thoughts in the Evening of Life, ed. with Memoir by C.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\n<ImageHere>Xiaomi 12S Ultra featured a \"Leica Summicron 1:1.9-4.1 / 13-120 ASPH camera system\".\n\n\n### Xiaomi and Harman Kardon  \nIn 2021, Harman Kardon collaborated with Xiaomi for its newest smartphone; the Xiaomi Mi 11 series are the first smartphones to feature with Harman Kardon-tuned dual speaker setup.  \n### Xiaomi and Leica  \nIn 2022, Leica Camera entered a strategic partnership with Xiaomi to jointly develop Leica cameras to be used in Xiaomi flagship smartphones, succeeding the partnership between Huawei and Leica. The first flagship smartphones under this new partnership were the Xiaomi 12S Ultra and Xiaomi MIX Fold 2, launched in July and August 2022, respectively.  \n### Xiaomi Studios  \nIn 2021, Xiaomi began collaborating with directors to create short films shot entirely using the Xiaomi Mi 11 line of phones. In 2022, they made two shorts with Jessica Henwick. The first, Bus Girl won several awards and was long-listed for Best British Short at the 2023 BAFTA.  \n## Corporate identity  \n### Name etymology  \nXiaomi (\u5c0f\u7c73) is the Chinese word for \"millet\". In 2011 its CEO Lei Jun suggested there are more meanings than just the \"millet and rice\". He linked the \"Xiao\" (\u5c0f) part to the Buddhist concept that \"a single grain of rice of a Buddhist is as great as a mountain\", suggesting that Xiaomi wants to work from the little things, instead of starting by striving for perfection, while \"mi\" (\u7c73) is an acronym for Mobile Internet and also \"mission impossible\", referring to the obstacles encountered in starting the company. He also stated that he thinks the name is cute. In 2012 Lei Jun said that the name is about revolution and being able to bring innovation into a new area. Xiaomi's new \"Rifle\" processor has given weight to several sources linking the latter meaning to the Chinese Communist Party's \"millet and rifle\" (\u5c0f\u7c73\u52a0\u6b65\u67aa) revolutionary idiom during the Second Sino-Japanese War.  \n### Logo and mascot  \nA Mi-Home store with the new logo  \nXiaomi's first logo consisted of a single orange square with the letters \"MI\" in white located in the center of the square. This logo was in use until 31 March 2021, when a new logo, designed by well-known Japanese designer Kenya Hara, replaced the old one, consisting of the same basic structure as the previous logo, but the square was replaced with a \"squircle\" with rounded corners instead, with the letters \"MI\" remaining identical to the previous logo, along with a slightly darker hue.  \nXiaomi's mascot, Mitu, is a white rabbit wearing an Ushanka (known locally as a \"Lei Feng hat\" in China) with a red star and a red scarf around its neck. Later on, the red star on the hat was replaced by the company's logo.  \n## Reception  \n### Imitation of Apple Inc.  \nXiaomi has been accused of imitating Apple Inc. The hunger marketing strategy of Xiaomi was described as riding on the back of the \"cult of Apple\".  \nAfter reading a book about Steve Jobs in college, Xiaomi's chairman and CEO, Lei Jun, carefully cultivated a Steve Jobs image, including jeans, dark shirts, and Jobs' announcement style at Xiaomi's earlier product announcements. He was characterized as a \"counterfeit Jobs.\"  \nIn 2013, critics debated how many of Xiaomi's products were innovative, and how much of their innovation was just really good public relations.  \nOthers point out that while there are similarities to Apple, the ability to customize the software based upon user preferences through the use of Google's Android operating system sets Xiaomi apart. Xiaomi has also developed a much wider range of consumer products than Apple.  \n### Violation of GNU General Public License  \nIn January 2018, Xiaomi was criticized for its non-compliance with the terms of the GNU General Public License. The Android project's Linux kernel is licensed under the copyleft terms of the GPL, which requires Xiaomi to distribute the complete source code of the Android kernel and device trees for every Android device it distributes. By refusing to do so, or by unreasonably delaying these releases, Xiaomi is operating in violation of intellectual property law in China, as a WIPO state. Prominent Android developer Francisco Franco publicly criticized Xiaomi's behaviour after repeated delays in the release of kernel source code. Xiaomi in 2013 said that it would release the kernel code. The kernel source code was available on the GitHub website in 2020.  \n### Privacy concerns and data collection  \nAs a company based in China, Xiaomi is obligated to share data with the Chinese government under the China Internet Security Law and National Intelligence Law. There were reports that Xiaomi's Cloud messaging service sends some private data, including call logs and contact information, to Xiaomi servers. Xiaomi later released an MIUI update that made cloud messaging optional and that no private data was sent to Xiaomi servers if the cloud messaging service was turned off.  \nOn 23 October 2014, Xiaomi announced that it was setting up servers outside of China for international users, citing improved services and compliance to regulations in several countries.  \nOn 19 October 2014, the Indian Air Force issued a warning against Xiaomi phones, stating that they were a national threat as they sent user data to an agency of the Chinese government.  \nIn April 2019, researchers at Check Point found a security breach in Xiaomi phone apps. The security flaw was reported to be preinstalled.  \nOn 30 April 2020, Forbes reported that Xiaomi extensively tracks use of its browsers, including private browser activity, phone metadata and device navigation, and more alarmingly, without secure encryption or data anonymization, more invasively and to a greater extent than mainstream browsers. Xiaomi disputed the claims, while confirming that it did extensively collect browsing data, and saying that the data was not linked to any individuals and that users had consented to being tracked. Xiaomi posted a response stating that the collection of aggregated usage statistics data is used for internal analysis, and would not link any personally identifiable information to any of this data. However, after a  followup by Gabriel Cirlig, the writer of the report, Xiaomi added an option to completely stop the information leak when using its browser in incognito mode.  \n### Censorship  \nIn September 2021, amidst a political spat between China and Lithuania, the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence urged people to dispose the Chinese-made mobile phones and avoid buying new ones, after the National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania claimed that Xiaomi devices have built-in censorship capabilities that can be turned on remotely.  \nXiaomi denied the accusations, saying that it \"does not censor communications to or from its users\", and that they would be engaging a third-party to assess the allegations. They also stated that regarding data privacy, it was compliant with two frameworks for following Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), namely its ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management Standards and the ISO/IEC 27701 Privacy Information Management System.  \n## Legal actions  \n### State administration of radio, film and television issue  \nIn November 2012, Xiaomi's smart set-top box stopped working one week after the launch due to the company having run foul of China's National Radio and Television Administration. The regulatory issues were overcome in January 2013.  \n### Misleading sales figures  \nThe Taiwanese Fair Trade Commission investigated the flash sales and found that Xiaomi had sold fewer smartphones than advertised. Xiaomi claimed that the number of smartphones sold was 10,000 units each for the first two flash sales, and 8,000 units for the third one. However, FTC investigated the claims and found that Xiaomi sold 9,339 devices in the first flash sale, 9,492 units in the second one, and 7,389 for the third. It was found that during the first flash sale, Xiaomi had given 1,750 priority \u2018F-codes\u2019 to people who could place their orders without having to go through the flash sale, thus diminishing the stock that was publicly available. The FTC fined Xiaomi TWD.  \n### Shut down of Australia store  \nIn March 2014, Xiaomi Store Australia (an unrelated business) began selling Xiaomi mobile phones online in Australia through its website, XiaomiStore.com.au. However, Xiaomi soon \"requested\" that the store be shut down by 25 July 2014. On 7 August 2014, shortly after sales were halted, the website was taken down. An industry commentator described the action by Xiaomi to get the Australian website closed down as unprecedented, saying, \"I\u2019ve never come across this . It would have to be a strategic move.\" At the time this left only one online vendor selling Xiaomi mobile phones into Australia, namely Yatango (formerly MobiCity), which was based in Hong Kong. This business closed in late 2015.  \n### Temporary ban in India due to patent infringement  \nOn 9 December 2014, the Delhi High Court granted an ex parte injunction that banned the import and sale of Xiaomi products in India. The injunction was issued in response to a complaint filed by Ericsson in connection with the infringement of its patent licensed under reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing. The injunction was applicable until 5 February 2015, the date on which the High Court was scheduled to summon both parties for a formal hearing of the case. On 16 December, the High Court granted permission to Xiaomi to sell its devices running on a Qualcomm-based processor until 8 January 2015. Xiaomi then held various sales on Flipkart, including one on 30 December 2014. Its flagship Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G phone sold out in six seconds. A judge extended the division bench's interim order, allowing Xiaomi to continue the sale of Qualcomm chipset-based handsets until March 2018.  \n### US sanctions due to ties with People's Liberation Army  \nIn January 2021, the United States government named Xiaomi as a company \"owned or controlled\" by the People's Liberation Army and thereby prohibited any American company or individual from investing in it. However, the investment ban was blocked by a US court ruling after Xiaomi filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with the court expressing skepticism regarding the government's national security concerns. Xiaomi denied the allegations of military ties and stated that its products and services were of civilian and commercial use. In May 2021, Xiaomi reached an agreement with the Defense Department to remove the designation of the company as military-linked.  \n### Lawsuit by KPN alleging patent infringement  \nOn 19 January 2021, KPN, a Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications company, sued Xiaomi and others for patent infringement. KPN filed similar lawsuits against Samsung in 2014 and 2015 in a court in the US.  \n### Lawsuit by Wyze alleging invalid patent  \nIn July 2021, Xiaomi submitted a report to Amazon alleging that Wyze Labs had infringed upon its 2019 \"Autonomous Cleaning Device and Wind Path Structure of Same\" robot vacuum patent. On 15 July 2021, Wyze filed a lawsuit against Xiaomi in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, arguing that prior art exists and asking the court for a declaratory judgment that Xiaomi's 2019 robot vacuum patent is invalid.  \n### Asset seizure in India  \nIn April 2022, India's Enforcement Directorate seized assets from Xiaomi as part of an investigation into violations of foreign exchange laws. The asset seizure was subsequently put on hold by a court order, but later upheld.  \n## Overseas manufacturing  \n### Inaugural plant in Pakistan  \nXiaomi's mobile device manufacturing plant was inaugurated on 4 March 2022, to begin production in Pakistan. The plant was set up in conjunction with Select Technologies (Pvt) Limited, an Air Link fully owned subsidiary. The production plant is located in Lahore.  \nAs of July 2022, the future of the plant is uncertain due to the 2021\u20132023 global supply chain crisis.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true based on the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

Several west Asian communities have also settled and become part of the diversity of coastal south west India. These include the Parsis, Bohras and Baghdadi Jews in the westernmost region, the Bene Israel along the South western region, the descendants of mediterranean traders along Coorg and Mangalore, the Jonakan Mappilas  along Malabar region, and the cochin jews and Syriac Nasranis along the southernmost region of South India. The Chola Empire established vast Tamil influence across South East Asian region  across Indonesia, Java, Bali and Sumatra. This brought South Indian Heritage to Cambodia, Indonesia and Bali where the Balinese Hindu traditions still thrives. This also lead to intermingling between coastal India and the south east Asia particularly in the South eastern Cholamandalam coastline along the Bay of Bengal.  \n### Heritage  \nThe linguistic diversity of Coastal India includes languages of the Dravidian language family including Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Tulu and Kannada; languages belonging to the western zone of Indo Iranian language families including Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani, languages belonging to the central zone of the Indo-Iranian language families including Urdu and Persian and languages belonging to the eastern zone of Indo Iranian language family including Odia and Bengali. The region also has speakers of Semitic languages like Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic. The common elements of the people of coastal India includes cuisine that consists of agrarian and coastal products and clothing that involves long flowing drapes with bare midriff for both men and women suited for humid and warm climate. Throughout coastal India women wear drapes called saree in various styles. In the western corner of the region the drapes are called as Dhoti for men.  and Chaniya choli for women, further southwards the drapes are called as lungi or mundu for men.  and veshti for women. Towards the southernmost tip of coastal south western India the social system of inheritance was once matrilineal. There are various festivals celebrated in the coastal states centered on deities.  \n## Tourism  \nThe tourism is enabled by numerous  \nislands, beaches and coral reefs in coastal India, full potential of which is yet to be exploited.  \n## Gallery\n\nQuestion: Which image shows a historical trade route involving ancient Coastal India?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Linke Wienzeile Buildings  \n<ImageHere>Majolica House by Otto Wagner (1898)\n\n<ImageHere>Medallion House by Otto Wagner\nThe Linke Wienzeile Buildings are two apartment buildings in Vienna constructed by Otto Wagner in 1898-99 in the Vienna Secession style. They are both lavishly decorated with colorful tiles, sculpture and wrought iron. One house,  at 40 Linke Wienzeile, has a facade covered with majolica, or glazed earthenware tiles in floral designs, is popularly known as the Majolica House.  The second, at 38 Linke Wienzeile, is called the Medallion House, for the bronze medallions on the facade.  It also features sculpted angels on the roof. A third building nearby, at 3 K\u00f6stlergasse, was the town residence of Wagner for a time.\n\n## History  \nAs Vienna was expanding rapidly around its edges, in 1893 Wagner proposed a project creating a new channel for the Wien river, a tributary of the Danube, and a grand boulevard with new buildings to line it. His project was accepted by the city government in 1894.  \nWagner was very critical of the historicism of the buildings which lined the Ringstrasse, the famous circular main boulevard of Vienna, which he termed a \"stylistic masked ball\". He presented his new ideas in an essay entitled Modern Architecture, published in 1896, calling for a new architecture whose forms expressed their functions. He had already designed several stations in the new style for the Vienna transit system. He now proposed two residential buildings in the new style.  \n### Majolica House, Linke Wienzeile 40 (1898-99)  \nThe most famous of these is the Majolikahaus or Majolica House, at Linke Wienzeile 40. Its facade is entirely covered with majolica, or colorful glazed earthenware tiles in the floral designs which characterized the early Vienna Secession. The facade decoration was made by his student de.   The facade was not only decorative, but had a practical purpose; the tile facade could be easily cleaned by using fire hoses.  \n### Medallion House, Linke Wienzeile 38 (1898-99)  \nThe other building, Linke Wienzeile 38, is known as Medallion House  because of its decor of gilded stucco medallions by Wagner's student and frequent collaborator, Koloman Moser.   The roof, visible from far away, features several sculpted heads, called The Criers, or The Crying Women by Othmar Schimkowitz.  He provided sculpture for other Vienna Secession landmarks including the three gorgons on the 1898 Secession Building by  Joseph Maria Olbrich, and for two other famous buildings by Hoffmann; the Kirche am Steinhof church in Vienna, and the rooftop sculpture of angels the Austrian Postal Savings Bank.  The sculptures and other ornaments were removed when the style was out of fashion, but recently it has been restored to its original appearance.  \nBoth buildings also feature very ornate wrought-iron decoration on the balconies and in the elevator cages and stairways in the interior, in keeping with the early Secession style.  \n### Wagner House, 3 K\u00f6stlergasse (1899)  \nWagner had his own town apartment in a third building he built close by, at 3 K\u00f6stlergasse.  It was completed in 1899, and had later renovations.   The white facade is very sober, in his later style, with almost no ornament.  The interior has more ornament, particularly in the curling railing of the stairwell.  \nHis apartment featured  decoration based on Japanese floral prints, and specially-designed furniture, but its most famous feature was the bathroom. A marble plaque on the wall supported the shower head, the sink was of marble on nickel legs, and the bathtub was of glass, mounted in a nickel frame. Wagner had the bathroom displayed at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following descriptions best matches the architectural style depicted in both images?\nChoice list: \nA.

He currently competes in the ARCA Racing Series, driving the No. 34 Chevrolet for Darrell Basham Racing.  \n## Racing career  \n### ARCA Racing Series  \n<ImageHere>Basham's 2013 ARCA car at Road America\nBasham made his ARCA Racing Series debut in 1972. In 1975, Basham posted a career-best finish of fifth twice, both times at Salem Speedway. One year later, he finished a career-best seventh place in the standings.  \nAfter driving sporadically over the next two decades, Basham began racing full-time again in 2002. The next season, Basham won the Spirit Award for his dedication and support for ARCA, uplifting spirit by way of example, perseverance, and positive attitude. He finished ninth in the 2009 Lucas Oil Slick Mist 200 at Daytona, tying his career-best finish at the track from 33 years earlier. That same year, Basham and his son Jason made ARCA history by becoming the first father/son duo to finish in the top 20 in the standings the same year.  \nIn 2011, Basham competed in all 19 races, having a best finish of 12th at Salem Speedway and finishing 10th in the season point standings. He also won the Spirit Award for the second time.  \nBasham made his 300th career ARCA start at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis in 2012, finishing 21st in the event. He had a best finish of 14th place that season at Winchester Speedway, and ultimately finished 11th in the points standings. He was awarded the Marcum Award at the Championship Awards Banquet for his positive efforts and contributions within the ARCA Racing community.\n<ImageHere>2018 ARCA car at Madison\nAfter racing a full schedule in the ARCA Racing Series for the previous 11 seasons, the 63-year-old Basham decided to reduce his schedule for the 2013 season and only compete on short tracks. Basham would run seventeen more races between 2014 and 2019. He did not make any starts for the next three years, but returned to the series for the 2023 season finale at Toledo, driving the No. 11 Ford for Fast Track Racing, where he would finish twelfth, albeit nineteen laps down to race winner William Sawalich.\n\n### NASCAR  \nBasham has competed in a single NASCAR Winston Cup Series event in his career, the 1979 Sun-Drop Music City USA 420 at Nashville Speedway in Nashville, Tennessee. He started and finished 24th in the 28-car field, completing 101 of the race's 420 laps before retiring from the event due to rear end failure. Basham also competed in the NASCAR-sanctioned Goody's Dash Series, a racing formula for four-cylinder subcompact cars, in the early and mid 1990s.  \n## Personal life  \nBasham has three children. His son Jason competed in 60 ARCA Racing Series events between 2003 and 2013.  \nBasham operates a business as an independent trucker, operating his shop and trucking business from shops attached to his home in Henryville; he builds his own racing engines as well. On March 2, 2012, Basham's race shop was destroyed by a tornado that devastated Henryville; Basham was able to salvage his race cars and other parts to reopen in a garage in Marysville, Indiana, and successfully resumed racing in ARCA, christening his car the Spirit of Henryville. He also has a son named Mike, who also has competed in ARCA, and a brother named Dugan, who worked as a crew chief for his Darrell's team.  \n## Motorsports career results  \n### NASCAR  \n(key) (Bold\u00a0\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Both aircraft were destroyed in crashes.  \n## YF-104A  \nA Lockheed YF-104A, AF ser. no. 55-2961, NASA aircraft number 818. First NASA flight on 27 August 1956, last operational flight on 26 August 1975 \u2013 1,439 flights over this period.  \n17 pre-production aircraft used for engine, equipment, and flight testing. Most were later converted to F-104A standard.  \n## F-104A  \nA total of 153 initial production versions were built. The F-104A was in USAF service from 1958 through 1960, then transferred to ANG until 1963 when they were recalled by the USAF Air Defense Command for the 319th and 331st Fighter Interceptor Squadrons. Some were released for export to Jordan, Pakistan, and Taiwan, each of whom used it in combat. In 1967 the 319th F-104As and Bs were re-engined with the J79-GE-19 engines with 17,900\u00a0lbf (79.6\u00a0kN) of thrust in afterburner; service ceiling with this engine was in excess of 73,000\u00a0ft (22,250\u00a0m). In 1969, all the F-104A/Bs in ADC service were retired. On 18 May 1958, an F-104A set a world speed record of 1,404.19\u00a0mph (2,259.82\u00a0km/h).  \n## NF-104A  \nThree demilitarized F-104A airframes with an additional 6,000\u00a0lbf (27\u00a0kN) Rocketdyne LR121/AR-2-NA-1 rocket engine and modified systems, used for astronaut training at altitudes up to 120,800\u00a0ft (36,820\u00a0m).  \n## QF-104A  \nA total of 22 F-104As converted into radio-controlled drones and test aircraft.  \n## F-104B  \nTandem two-seat, dual-control trainer version of F-104A, 26-built.

Manufactured by Lockheed, and under license by Canadair and a consortium of European companies which included Messerschmitt/MBB, Dornier, Fiat, Fokker and SABCA. The type featured strengthened fuselage and wing structure, increased internal fuel capacity, an enlarged vertical fin, strengthened landing gear with larger tires and revised flaps for improved combat maneuvering. Upgraded avionics included a new Autonetics NASARR F15A-41B radar with air-to-air and ground mapping modes, the Litton LN-3 Inertial Navigation System (the first on a production fighter) and an infrared sight.\n\n### RF-104G  \n189 tactical reconnaissance models based on F-104G, usually with three KS-67A cameras mounted in the forward fuselage in place of cannon.  \n### TF-104G  \n220 combat-capable trainer version of F-104G; no cannon or centerline pylon, reduced internal fuel. One aircraft used by Lockheed as a demonstrator with the civil registration number L104L, was flown by Jackie Cochran to set three women's world speed records in 1964. This aircraft later served in the Netherlands. A pair of two-seat TF-104Gs and a single-seat F-104G joined the Dryden inventory in June 1975.  \n## F-104H  \nProjected export version based on a F-104G with simplified equipment and optical gunsight. Not built.  \n## F-104J  \nSpecialized interceptor version of the F-104G for the Japanese ASDF, built under license by Mitsubishi for the air-superiority fighter role, armed with cannon and four Sidewinders; no strike capability. Some were converted to UF-104J radio-controlled target drones and destroyed. Total of 210 built, three built by Lockheed, 29 built by Mitsubushi from Lockheed built components and 178 built by Mitsubishi.  \n## F-104N  \nThree F-104Gs were delivered to NASA in 1963 for use as high-speed chase aircraft. One, piloted by Joe Walker, collided with an XB-70 on 8 June 1966.  \n## F-104S (Lockheed Model CL-901)  \nF-104S in original camouflage scheme with Sparrow missiles mounted under the wings, c. 1969  \nProduced mainly by Fiat and Aeritalia (one aircraft was lost before delivery), upgraded for the interception role having NASARR R-21G/H radar with moving target indicator and continuous wave illuminator for SARH missiles (initially AIM-7 Sparrow), two additional wing and two underbelly hardpoints (to give a total of nine), uprated J79-GE-19 engine with 52.8\u00a0kN (11,870\u00a0lbf) thrust (79.6\u00a0kN/17,900\u00a0lbf with afterburner), and two additional ventral fins for increased stability at high Mach numbers. Up to two Sparrow; and two, theoretically four or six, Sidewinder missiles were carried on all the hardpoints except the central (underbelly), or seven 340\u00a0kg (750\u00a0lb) bombs (normally, two-four 227\u2013340\u00a0kg/500-750\u00a0lb). Range was up to 1,250\u00a0km (777\u00a0mi) with four tanks, ferry range 2,940\u00a0km (1,827\u00a0mi). Aircraft allocated to air defence missions had their 20\u00a0mm (.79\u00a0in) M-61 Vulcan cannon removed. The F-104S was cleared for a higher maximum takeoff weight, allowing it to carry up to 7,500\u00a0lb (3,400\u00a0kg) of stores; other Starfighters had a maximum external load of 4,000\u00a0lb (1,814\u00a0kg). With four under wing drop tanks range was up to 780\u00a0mi (1,250\u00a0km). Production of the F-104S totalled 286, with the Italian Air Force taking delivery of 246 and the Turkish Air Force receiving 40 aircraft.  \n### F-104S-ASA  \n(Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma \u2013 \"Weapon Systems Update\") \u2013 An upgraded F-104S, 147 were modified from existing airframes, with Fiat R21G/M1 radar with frequency hopping, look-down/shoot-down capability, new IFF and weapons delivery computer, and provision for AIM-9L all-aspect Sidewinder and Selenia Aspide missiles. Due to the delays of Aspide integration, the initial version, with Raytheon AIM-7 Sparrows was designated ASA-1. When the Aspide became available, all F-104Ss were upgraded to ASA-2 standard. First flown in 1985 the F-104S-ASA was principally an air-defence aircraft without enhancements to ground attack capabilities and were later modified to interceptor standards (CI) with removal of the 20\u00a0mm (.79\u00a0in) M-61 Vulcan cannon.  \n### F-104S-ASA/M  \n(Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma/Modificato \u2013 \"Weapon Systems Update/Modified\") \u2013 49 F-104S-ASA and 15 two-seat TF-104G aircraft upgraded from 1998 to ASA/M standard with GPS, new TACAN and Litton LN-30A2 INS, refurbished airframe, and improved cockpit displays. All strike-related equipment was removed, including the IRST (the small unit known as 'IR-Sight', forward the windshield). The last Starfighters in combat service, the F-104S-ASA/M was withdrawn in October 2004 (the last unit being 10\u00b0 Gruppo/9\u00b0 Stormo, Grazzanise), and temporarily replaced by F-16 Fighting Falcons, whilst awaiting delivery of Eurofighter Typhoons.  \n## CF-104  \n200 Canadian-built versions, built under license by Canadair and optimized for both nuclear strike and 2-stage-to-orbit payload delivery, having NASARR R-24A radar with air-to-air modes, cannon deleted (restored after 1972), additional internal fuel cell, and Canadian J79-OEL-7 engines with 10,000\u00a0lbf (44\u00a0kN)/15,800\u00a0lbf (70\u00a0kN) thrust.  \n### CF-104D  \n38 dual-control trainer versions of CF-104, built by Lockheed, but with Canadian J79-OEL-7 engines. Some later transferred to Denmark, Norway and Turkey.\n\nQuestion: Which aircraft set a world altitude record of 103,395 ft (31,515 m) on 14 December 1959?\nChoice list: \nA. German RF-104G\nB.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\n<ImageHere>The music video for \"Love Again\" was filmed at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London.\nThe visual was filmed at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London about three weeks before its release, during rehearsals for Lipa's performance at the 41st Brit Awards. Serrano liked the idea of shooting in one place as it adds to the video's cohesiveness and makes it as though the characters are real and belong to the setting. The video's team quarantined in the hotel for a week before they began filming due to restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This gave the team time to work in the location. Lipa learned the video's choreography in 45 minutes and new outfits were added for her in the midst of filming. Serrano recalled she enjoyed being on the mechanical bull that was controlled. Steve Dent helped the team with the horse and production company Eighty4 helped with the VFX, making it so that when the horse went invisible, there was still a 3D aspect with the saddle and rider. These shots were the hardest to shoot so the team worked with the tension of the ropes attached to the horse's neck as well as adjusting its natural shadow.  \nLipa formally announced the video on 31 May 2021. It premiered via YouTube on 4 June 2021. A director's cut version of the video was released on 28 July 2021. This version opens with two rodeo clowns reading a script, which is the lyrics of \"Love Again\", more classical paintings in the editing, less dancing, more shots of the clowns, a chicken on the TV set, Lipa riding the lighting horse as well as final credits that feature a rodeo clown riding the horse which has a green suit on.\n\n### Analysis and synopsis  \nThe video opens with two title cards saying Lipa's name and the song title, \"Love Again\". Simultaneously, a Stetson cowboy hat floats from a coat room to a ballroom where Lipa catches it and puts it on her head. She wears a zebra print bikini top, belted black denim shorts, a suede vest, a cowboy hat, a bolo tie and chunky heeled boots while riding a mechanical bull; this bull later becomes invisible as a way to make things less emphatic and literal. Intercut scenes of Lipa riding the bull covered in miniature light bulbs and wearing a Phipps cowboy suit containing a green top, blue pants and a cowboy hat, also covered in miniature light bulbs, are also included, as well as her floating in slow motion while wearing Blumarine pink bandana crop top with a lacy trim, a lavender hat, a butterfly belt buckle with diamant\u00e9s, blue denim pants and pink cowboy boots. She later waves a glowing lasso in the former scene. The singer is also seen cracking eggs with different coloured yolks to later whisk them in the same bowl while rodeo clowns crack them too and paint clown faces on each other with the coloured yolks as well as making omelettes. She wears a red-and-black denim set from a collaboration between Levi and Miu Miu with a leather jacket from the latter company's 2011 line.  \nBack in the ballroom, Lipa square dances and line dances with rodeo clowns as the floor is covered in eggs. She wears Rick Owens grill kiss leather boots, camouflage green cargo pants, a longline brown cow print jacket and a cow-print bra; the latter three clothing items are from The Attico. Some of the rodeo clowns also appear on invisible horses. Further on, a giant egg floats in the middle of the ballroom and the rodeo clowns attempt to capture it with lassos. The egg is eventually too much for them as it pulls them onto the floor before also becoming invisible. A horse covered in LEDs then runs in around the hallways. The \"wild\" horse scene is a metaphor for the idea of love, not being completely clear, while the egg scene adds to the metaphor by enhancing the people in the relationship with the cowboys, ropes and horse. Also, the floating egg being captured, tensioning its delicacy, is a metaphor for the myth of female reproduction and how weak male human violence can be. The video closes with Lipa dressed as a rodeo clown, slow dancing with an anonymous person; they both wear all white. Lipa wears a red nose and wipes some of her lipstick of the same colour onto her partner's jacket.  \n### Reception  \nMaia Kedem of Audacy hypothesised that Lipa wearing the clown makeup at the end may be a metaphor for \"the clownery of falling back in love after experiencing heartbreak\", while calling the metaphor \"deep\". Hot Presss Ciaran Brennan viewed Lipa's style in the video as \"cowboy chic\". In Refinery29, Eliza Huber said that although Western tropes in fashion have been popular for a while, Lipa makes the style \"feel surprisingly fresh\" in the video, while also comparing it to the clip for Madonna's \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000). Wang compared the hotel ballroom setting to The Shining (1980) while theorizing that the video documents the cast's \"slow descent into insanity\", \"putting on clown makeup to also hoedown in the building\u2019s empty ballroom\". For Grazia, Marisa Petrarca called the video \"absolute gold\" with Lipa embracing a \"glamorous take on Western fashion\" containing \"epic\" ensembles. Business Insider used the video as an example on how Stetson cowboy hats have changed demography in their \"So Expensive\" web series.  \nFor Vulture, Devon Ivie labeled the music video a \"surrealist country-inspired video\" that \"has us falling in love with Lipa all over again\". The staff of Wonderland said their minds \"are totally blown\" with the video, while calling the fashion \"gorgeous\" and the choreography \"a TikTok worthy dance routine\". In The A.V. Club, Gabrielle Sanchez noted science fiction elements in the video with the invisible mechanical bull. Similarly, Erica Gonzales of Harper's Bazaar thought these elements are more \"surreal\", while also stating that the clown makeup is the best part of the video and thought that it poked fun at the \"clownery\" of falling in love knowing it could end badly. In a review from Billboard, Gil Kaufman said that Lipa gets her \"urban cowgal on\" in the visual and thought she took a \"sensual, slow-mo ride\" on the mechanical bull.  \nCinquemani thought that the main takeaway from the video was \"keep falling for the wrong person and the yolk's on you\" while noting its use of special effects and praising the surreality. He went on to note that Lipa's \"disco-cowgirl getup and choreography\" was similar to that of \"Don't Tell Me\" and Halsey's \"You Should Be Sad\" (2020). The staff of Contactmusic.com said that Lipa looks like a \"super-sexy Jessie Cowgirl\" and praised her \"natural born\" bull-riding skills. They also said that the video gives the song \"a whole new lease of life\". For Consequence, Wren Graves named the video a \"campy rodeo fantasy\", while commending how Lipa waves her lasso, similarly to Wonder Woman. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! stated that with the video, Lipa proves that \"country and western dressup is a trend that will simply not die\". \"Love Again\" won Best Pop Video at the 2021 UK Music Video Awards.  \n## Live performances  \n<ImageHere>Lipa performing \"Love Again\" on the Future Nostalgia Tour in 2022\nLipa performed \"Love Again\" during her NPR Tiny Desk Concert, released 4 December 2020. Lipa described the performance as a \"special\" rendition of the song and the concert was filmed in London instead of Washington, D.C. where the concerts normally take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She was accompanied by backup singers, a bassist, a guitarist and a drum machine. On 19 February 2021, the singer performed a stripped-down acoustic version of the track during the 2021 Time 100 event along with her 2020 single \"Levitating\". Lipa performed the soft piano rendition of the song as a duet with Elton John at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party on 25 April 2021. She performed the song at the 41st Brit Awards as part of her set list of a Future Nostalgia Medley on 11 May 2021. The singer performed it at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Festival on 17 September. The song was included on the setlist of Lipa's 2022 Future Nostalgia Tour.\n\n## Track listings  \n* Digital download and streaming \u2013 Horse Meat Disco remix  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Horse Meat Disco remix) \u2013 5:31  \n* Radio airplay \u2013 French radio edit  \n-  \"Love Again\" \u2013 2:35  \n* Digital download and streaming  \n-  \"Love Again\" \u2013 4:18  \n* Contemporary hit and adult contemporary radio \u2013 radio edit  \n-  \"Love Again\" \u2013 3:53  \n* Digital download and streaming \u2013 Imanbek remix  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Imanbek remix) \u2013 3:34  \n* Streaming \u2013 Imanbek remix \u2013 Spotify single  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Imanbek remix) \u2013 3:34  \n-  \"Love Again\" \u2013 4:18  \n* Digital download and streaming \u2013 Garabatto remix  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Garabatto remix) \u2013 3:29  \n* Streaming \u2013 Garabatto remix \u2013 Spotify single  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Garabatto remix) \u2013 3:29  \n-  \"Love Again\" (Imanbek remix) \u2013 3:34  \n-  \"Love Again\" \u2013 4:18  \n## Personnel  \n* Dua Lipa vocals  \n* Koz production, bass, drums, guitar, synthesizer  \n* Stuart Price additional production, bass guitar, keyboards  \n* Clarence Coffee Jr. backing vocals  \n* Alma Goodman backing vocals  \n* Vanessa Luciano backing vocals  \n* Chelcee Grimes backing vocalsnotetag|In the liner notes of Future Nostalgia: The Moonlight Edition, only Clarence Coffee Jr., Alma Goodman and Vanessa Luciano are credited as backing vocalists on \"Love Again\".

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nFrancis Lord Newport, the Lord Lieutenant, was responsible for purging Calvinists from public office after the Restoration. He later suffered a similar fate himself for his opposition to the succession of James II.\n\n<ImageHere>Thomas Jones, the town clerk of Shrewsbury. A Presbyterian who had remained in the town when it was under royalist military occupation during the Civil War, Jones was nonetheless seen as a threat by Newport and Ottley who went to considerable lengths to remove him. This did not impede his later career and he went on to become Chief Justice of the Common Pleas under James II.\nAfter General Monck's intervention against the remaining Commonwealth forces, at the beginning of 1660, Richard Ottley came back into public life and began to take part in local government. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire in March 1660. There are no records for 1660 but he and Adam, his brother, are recorded as sitting on the bench at the January quarter sessions of 1660/61. Thereafter he does not appear in the record again until July 1662 and his attendance thereafter seems to have been sporadic.  \nOttley contacted Charles II and on 5 March Charles issued a commission from Brussels, appointing Ottley, his friend Richard Scriven and others as commissioners for Shropshire. They were authorised to raise a large militia force for the king's cause, to set up a command structure and to levy contributions for its support. Shrewsbury was still held by the stalwart Parliamentarian Colonel Thomas Hunt, who carried out a review of military resources and preparedness during April and arranged a muster of his forces for 1 May. However events were moving too quickly for Hunt's measures to take effect. The Convention Parliament accepted Charles II as king on 8 May. Ottley set off for Dover to welcome Charles to England in May. Charles entered London on 29 May and Ottley wrote from there to his mother:  \n\"My most deare and evere honored Mother,  \n\"I prayse God we are safe come to towne, and his Matie, with his two brotheres, the duke of Yorke and duke of Glouster, are now at Whitehall. I met them at Canterbury, and had the happinesse to be of the life guard since Fryday last; wherein my content over ballanced the paynes I underwent. I most, humbly thanke yor Lap for your py which I shiall enquire after. I beg pardon that I am soe short in wrighting, being weary at p'sent: I humbly crave yor blessing: wth my duty and thanks for yor goodnesse to mine, for whom my hearty prayers to God are : I rest  \n\"Yor Laps most dutiful sonne and servant,  \n\"May 29, Ric. Ottley.\"  \nShortly after the king's return, Ottley was knighted. On 19 June Ottley and Scriven issued a document at Shrewsbury that effectively annexed the resources promised to Hunt's militia to their own force, ending the dual military authority that had existed formally to that point. On 16 July a letter was issued by command of Charles II urging the Mayor of Shrewsbury to appoint Adam Ottley as town clerk. However, then position then was not, as the king had been informed, vacant: the post had been filled during the Commonwealth by Thomas Jones, who was to prove a resourceful opponent to the new dispensation.  \nOn 26 July Francis Lord Newport of High Ercall was commissioned Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire with wide-ranging powers. Ottley was made his Deputy Lieutenant on 3 September. The following month Newport appointed him captain of a cavalry troop in the county militia.  \nRepression of the old Parliamentarians began with claims that some had taken property from High Ercall and other places. Their houses were ransacked, resulting in a petition of protest from Thomas Hunt, an alderman of Shrewsbury, to the House of Commons, alleging he had lost goods to the value of \u00a31377 18s. 9d. Edmund Waring, a former Parliamentarian governor of Shrewsbury, and Vavasor Powell, a Welsh Independent preacher and theologian, were arrested and imprisoned. Ottley released Waring after a short time, as he was not persuaded there were good grounds or valid warrant for his detention. A Fifth Monarchist rising in London on 6 January 1661 panicked the Privy Council. On 8 January Newport was ordered to disarm any disaffected people in the county and to administer to them the Oath of Supremacy. On 22 January a further letter stepped up the pressure greatly with a demand that the county authorities arrest \"dangerous persons.\" Forwarding the Privy Council's letter to Ottley on 24 January, Newport rebuked him for being too lenient:  \n\"I send you enclosed a letter from the Councell, and a proclamation for the moderating of your proceedings. Though it may bee conceived a very ineffectual way for the securinge of persons to send warrants to a constable, yet if souldiers bringe the warrant to him, your ends may seeme accomplishable. You see the letter speakes of leadinge men. Therefore you did ill in releasinge Waringe, and you needed not have apprehended his ranting demand of a mittimus, which will serve him for discourse in his two pot houses. I would advise you to send for him agen, though not as a criminal by proofe, yet as a dangerous person, especially havinge the comand of the Councell for it.\"  \nHowever, Newport then drew Ottley's attention to an enclosed complaint from Captain Turner, who had been detained while visiting his wife and children at Shrewsbury, though he had a valid pass to do so from the authorities at Hull to do so: Newport urged Ottley allow him to leave the town. With neither Newport nor the Council quite able to define their desired balance of clemency and repression, Ottley seems to have erred on the side of rigour. By 4 March the Council was troubled that the Shropshire authorities might be overstepping the mark. They wrote to tell Newport that the king was troubled by large numbers of petitions from those arrested on mere suspicion and that they were to be released forthwith. Many of those arrested were Quakers, who had suffered persecution even before the Restoration. Henceforth, decreed the Council, only the \"Ringleaders of Faction\" were to be detained.  \nNevertheless, Newport had already recommended Ottley and Sir Francis Lawley as MPs for the county of Shropshire, and they were duly elected in April. However, the borough of Shrewsbury elected as its two members its town clerk, Thomas Jones, a leading Presbyterian although never an enthusiastic Parliamentarian, and Robert Leighton, who had been uncommitted in the Civil War.  Attempts under the Convention Parliament (1660) to accommodate the Presbyterians within the Church of England had come to nothing. Jones was determined to entrench Presbyterianism in Shrewsbury for as long as possible. In October 1661 he had a new deed of appointment drawn up for Francis Tallents, the Presbyterian minister of St Mary's Church, which was technically a Royal Peculiar but actually in the gift of the council. Jones was supported in this by the mayor, Richard Bagot, and the headmaster of Shrewsbury School, Richard Pigot. The Corporation Act of December 1661 gave Newport and Ottley an opportunity, as it sought to remove Presbyterians from office by forcing them to abjure the Solemn League and Covenant. Newport urged Ottley to use his seat at Westminster to speak out against Jones. Ottley's intervention sent Jones back to Shrewsbury, where he tried to get all vacant places on the council immediately filled with supporters. However, the deputy lieutenants sent men to impose house arrest on the mayor and aldermen and removed them from office for refusing to take the oath. Tallents and Pigot, together with other known Presbyterians and ex-Roundhead officers were imprisoned in July 1662. Newport and a group of county gentry were appointed commissioners to review and reform the governance of the town. They appointed Adam Ottley town clerk in place of Jones on 9 August, citing Jones's long record of political manoeuvring, promoting Presbytrerianism, giving legal advice to suspects. This was followed by a thorough purge of Nonconformists from public life. There was widespread agitation against the restored monarchy early in 1663. Repressive activity in Shropshire was initially at a lower level than in neighbouring counties. However, in July 1663 Newport used the rumour of a plot to seize Chester Castle to send Ottley after supposed conspiratorial meetings of ejected ministers in Shrewsbury, with detailed instructions for spying and intimidation. In October, with rumours of plots still abounding, Newport told Ottley to confine military preparations to the close guarding of the major towns to avoid the expense of mobilising the militia outside the time of the general muster. Later he reverted to warning that the Presbyterians of Shrewsbury might be in league with conspirators in the North of England and recommending that they and Waring be subject to a fishing expedition with a view to \"entrap some of them in their answers.\" A similar group of suspects were subjected to further detention in August 1665.\n\n## Cavalier Parliament  \nOttley was elected to the Parliament of 1661\u201379, the longest-lasting English parliament, and did not survive to the end of it, dying in 1670. The parliament was known as the Cavalier Parliament because it was largely royalist in sympathy, although important divisions appeared long before it ended. Ottley's election was almost certainly the result of Newport's influence. Newport, later first Earl of Bradford, was to dominate elections until his death in 1708, gradually evolving into a Whig and suffering for it when he opposed the succession of James II.  \nAfter being a very active lieutenant of Newport in the county, Ottley became a very active member of Parliament, which probably accounts for his decreasing participation in local and regional affairs. He was a member of no less than 230 committees. Initially much of his work reflected his work at local level, with a focus on legislation that repressed religious dissent. He was on the committee that steered the Act of Uniformity 1662. He was also a member of the committees for the Conventicle Act 1664 and a second Corporations Act, both elaborating the Clarendon Code which bore down on both Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists. His political loyalty and zeal brought appointment as a Gentleman of the Privy chamber on 18 December 1663. After the fall of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon in 1667, Ottley served on the committee to investigate his Sale of Dunkirk to France and another which looked into the running of the fund for loyal and indigent officers, which had been set up by the king to compensate royalist officers ruined by the Civil War. He had been one of the commissioners implementing the scheme in Shropshire. It had proved a disappointment and protests in 1666 led to a review.  \nOttley's own compensation took the form of commissions to collect taxes in Shropshire, which he undertook with his close friend and business partner, Richard Scriven, later MP for Bishop's Castle First they were made receivers of the county's hearth tax, the key tax on property. In 1663 they made a successful bid of \u00a32,800 for the farm of the county's excise. However, the hearth tax concession was revoked in 1667 and Ottley and Scriven were ordered to pay arrears of \u00a3700. They sought to collect the amounts owing but this led to public disorder, with distrained goods and papers being stolen. To help his efforts at repayment, he was given any prize-money concealed during the Commonwealth that he could discover. He and Scriven were also granted all treasure trove found since the Restoration, as well as part of a Cheshire outlaw's estate. However, they were still unsuccessful. Ottley's arrears were remitted shortly before he died in 1670, although Scriven did not settle his debt until 1682.  \n## Marriage and family  \nRichard Ottley was married to Lady Lettice Ridgeway, daughter of Robert Ridgeway, 2nd Earl of Londonderry. The Ridgeway family fortune was based on the first earl's exploitation of land assigned to him as an \"undertaker,\" or government contactor, during the Plantation of Ulster. Richard and Lady Lettice Ottley had six sons and one daughter, five of whose baptisms are recorded in the Pitchford parish register.  \n* Francis, born 11 October 1649. Died May 1652.  \n* Thomas (baptised 18 February 1651), Sir Richard's heir, married one Elizabeth and died in 1695.  \n* Richard (baptised 6 July 1652), died in infancy and was buried 30 March 1654.  \n* Adam (baptised 5 January 1655), Bishop of St David's 1713\u201323, died in 1723.  \n* Robert (baptised 26 July 1655)  \n* Lucy (baptised 28 February 1657) died in 1687  \n* Francis (baptised 2 June 1660)  \nDame Lettice Ottley was buried at Pitchford on 8 March 1669. Sir Richard Ottley died aged 44 on 10 August 1670 and was buried at Pitchford.  \n### Family tree  \nThe following family tree is based on information extracted from the heraldic visitations of Shropshire, Lord Hawkesbury's pedigree and the Pitchford parish register.  \n## Footnotes\n\nQuestion: Which individual was appointed as a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire in March 1660 and later became Deputy Lieutenant under Francis Lord Newport?\nChoice list: \nA.

(See the illustration of the water circulation in Arrocampo) (...)  \nThe walls of thermic separation (pantallas de separaci\u00f3n t\u00e9rmica in Spanish) (PST) are 11\u00a0km long and 8 m high (...).  The tops of these walls are used by great cormorants and great egret as standing, resting and sleeping areas.  \n## The Arrocampo reservoir as a wetland  \nArrocampo reservoir  \n<ImageHere>The grey heron can be watched in Arrocampo\n* Biomass (ecology): biomass of reservoir waters is very important on all trophic levels, including Phytoplankton and zooplankton.  \n* Fish: Angling is often practiced on weekend and feast days. There are sometimes a lot of recreational fishermen at the principal access to the reservoir, near the local route Almaraz-Saucedilla.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Organization of American States Secretariat for Multidimensional Security  \nThe Secretariat for Multidimensional Security of the Organization of American States is a part of the General Secretariat, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. The Secretariat for Multidimensional Security has a mandate to promote cooperation between Organization's Member States, Inter-American and international organizations, as well as with entities such as the United Nations and its subsidiaries, in order to analyze, prevent, confront and respond to security threats.  \nThe Secretariat is composed of the Executive Office of the Secretary for Multidimensional Security and the following main directorates:  \n* the Department of Public Security (DPS)  \n* the Executive Secretariat of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) at the departmental level  \n* the Secretariat of the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism at the departmental level  \n* the Department against Transnational Organized Crime (DTOC)  \n## History  \nSecretary General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza of the Organization of American States created the Secretariat for Multidimensional Security in 2005, as a direct response to the 2003 Declaration on Security in the Americas, adopted in Mexico City. This measure institutionalized the concept of multidimensional security, ensuring that the public and citizens were at the center of the Secretariat's policy discussion.  \nThe SMS works in close coordination with the Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Public Security in the Americas (MISPA) and the Meeting of Justice Ministers and Attorneys General in the Americas (REMJA).  \nThe scope of activity of the SMS is defined by the Declaration on Security in the Americas and its conceptualization of hemispheric security as being multidimensional and comprising traditional threats and new threats, concerns, and challenges to the security of the states of the Hemisphere.  \nThe Secretariat's mandates stem from the following documents and political bodies:  \n* Declaration on Security in the Americas  \n* General Assembly Summit  \n* 17 Political and Technical Subsidiary Bodies  \n## Mission statement  \n## Responsibilities  \nThe Secretariat is mandated, as from the 2003 Declaration on Security in the Americas, to coordinate technical assistance and cooperation in the following six areas:  \n-  Laws;  \n-  Compliance with laws;  \n-  The prevention of delinquent activities and drug consumption;  \n-  Victims assistance;  \n-  Rehabilitation of criminal offenders;  \n-  The promotion of peace and security in the Hemisphere.  \nThe Secretariat of Multidimensional Security offers solutions founded upon the model of Smart Security. This model requires objective, evidence- based and systemic approaches to the development of proposals and solutions, which respond to national or regional necessities and capacities; from a multidimensional perspective.  \n## Organizational structure  \n### Secretariat for Multidimensional Security  \n#### Secretary for Multidimensional Security  \nThe current Secretary for Multidimensional Security at the Organization of American States is Luis Fernando Lima Oliveira. Prior to Mr. Oliveria, the post was held by Nobel Peace Prize nominee and former Attorney General of Guatemala Claudia Paz y Paz Bailey. She was the first woman ever to assume the position of Attorney General in her country and has been invaluable in developing the rule of law and transforming the justice sector.  \n#### The Department of Public Security (DPS)  \nThe DPS works with Member States to develop mechanisms to evaluate and strengthen their institutional capacity to address threats to public security. These efforts focus on the following areas: the strengthening of security legislation, the improvement of law enforcement coordination and practices, the prevention of crime and violence, victim assistance and the social reintegration of convicted criminals.  \nThe Department of Public Security's Director is Paulina do Carmo Arruda Vieira Duarte.  \n#### Executive Secretariat of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD)  \n<ImageHere>CICAD was founded by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in 1986, in Guatemala City\nThe Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) is the Western Hemisphere's policy forum for dealing with the drug problem. The CICAD Executive Secretariat supports the Commission by strengthening the human and institutional capabilities and channeling the collective efforts of its member states to reduce the production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs. The Hemispheric Drug Strategy, approved in May 2010, expresses the firm commitment of Member States to deal with the consequences of drug trade, which poses a growing threat to health, economic development, social cohesion, and the rule of law.  \nCICAD was established by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1986. Each member government appoints a high-ranking representative to the Commission, which meets twice a year.  \nCICAD's Executive Secretary is Adam Namm, an American diplomat and former US Ambassador to Ecuador.\n\n#### The Secretariat of the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE)  \n<ImageHere>CICTE's programs include border control, cybersecurity, combating terrorism financing, immigration, customs, among others.\nThe main purpose of the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) is to promote and develop cooperation among Member States to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism, in accordance with the principles of the OAS Charter, with the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism, and with full respect for the sovereignty of states, the rule of law, and international law, including international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and international refugee law.  \nCICTE is composed of all Member States of the OAS and holds one regular session each year as a forum for discussion and decision-making on counter terrorism issues, measures, and cooperation. Member States designate a competent national authority, a principal representative, alternate representatives, and advisors. Member States also appoint one or more National Points of Contact with competence in the field of prevention and elimination of terrorism to serve as the principal liaison among governments of the Member States and with the CICTE Secretariat for developing cooperation programs between them and the CICTE Secretariat.  \nCICTE's Executive Secretary is Alison August Treppel.\n\n#### The Department against Transnational Organized Crime (DTOC)  \nThe function of this department is to provide technical and legislative assistance to Member States belonging to the OAS in the combat against transnational organized crime (TOC). DTOC, specifically, assists States in complying with the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the three Protocols stated therein: trafficking in persons, illicit trafficking of firearms, and illegal smuggling of migrants. The Department also supports States in complying with the Hemispheric Plan of Action against TOC and the Chapultepec Consensus. Among its many functions, the combat against money laundering, is a primary task. The DTOC anti-money laundering program assists States in implementing international standards and regulations in the prevention and fight against money laundering, and its linkages with other organized crimes, such as illicit arms trafficking, illegal smuggling of migrants, and human trafficking.  The GELAVEX forum is the main hemispheric entity by which DTOC helps countries in this endeavor. The forum is composed of two Sub-Working Groups: International Cooperation and Confiscation, and Coordination between Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) and Criminal Investigation Organizations (CIO). Progress from GELAVEX initiatives are several: legislative analysis among States to produce a set of guidelines with respect to money laundering, production of studies of money laundering cases linked to other transnational crimes, production of expert reports, creating a guide for spatial investigations surrounding transnational organized crime cases, and authoring studies on the confiscation of equivalent and mixed property assets. Other lines of action in the combat against transnational organized crime, include the provision of technical assistance when applying research tools and instruments when investigating criminal investigations; combating illicit mining, such as in artisanal gold; and helping implement the Inter-American Convention against the illicit Manufacturing of and trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, explosives, and Other Related Materials (CIFTA).  \n#### Other political bodies with topics related to the Secretariat  \n* Inter-American Defense Board  \n* Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials  \n* Hemispheric Plan Against Transnational Organized Crime  \n* Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism of the Inter-American Commission on Drug Abuse Control  \n* Working Group to Prepare a Regional Strategy to Promote Inter-American Cooperation in Dealing with Criminal Gangs  \n* Technical Group on Transnational Organized Crime  \n* Meeting of National Authorities on Trafficking of Persons  \n* Meeting of Officials Responsible for Penitentiary and Prison Policies  \n* Meeting of Forensic Specialists  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups in Reducing Drug Demand  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups on Money Laundering  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups on Maritime Traffic  \n* Meetings of Expert Groups on Precursor Chemicals  \n* Meetings with Attorneys General  \n* Meetings with Ministers of Justice  \n* Meetings with Ministers of Security  \nFinally, the Secretariat maintains relationships with other agencies and international agencies such as UNODC and the Central American Integration System to carry out its mission.\n\nQuestion: Which organization was founded by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in 1986 in Guatemala City to address the drug problem in the Western Hemisphere?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nEmma Bonino, More Europe's founder and former leader.\nThe electoral list was launched in November 2017 by two liberal and pro-Europeanist parties, the Italian Radicals, whose leading members included Emma Bonino, Riccardo Magi and Marco Cappato, and the newborn Forza Europa, led by Benedetto Della Vedova, with the goal to take part in the next general election under the leadership of Emma Bonino. Emma Bonino showed off the list's electoral logo, with her name on it, during an interview at Che tempo che fa, an Italian late-night talk show.  \nHowever, in January their alliance with the centre-left was breaking apart due to technical difficulties. The electoral law approved in November 2017 required that the parties that wants to run in the elections and are not supported by any parliamentary group must collect 1,500 signatures for each of the 63 proportional constituencies in which the country has been divided according to the electoral law. However, since the constituencies were published only a few weeks before the elections, for the 2018 elections the number of signatures was reduced to 400, for a total of 25,200 signatures requested. The objection of More Europe concerned the fact that in the form to collect the signatures, they must indicate, along with the candidates in the plurinominal constituencies, all the 348 candidates in the single-member constituencies. The centre-left coalition, however, had not yet reached an agreement for candidates for single-member constituencies, and More Europe believed it was impossible to collect signatures in a few days because they expected that an agreement between the centre-left coalition parties would be reached only in the last days available before the closing of the presentation of candidates, leaving less than a week for the collection of signatures. The Deputy Secretary of the Democratic Party Maurizio Martina has offered to help More Europe to collect signatures within a few days, but Piercamillo Falasca, Secretary of Forza Europa, has declined the proposal explaining that the Democratic Party should ensure \"equal conditions of access to the elections\".  \nHowever, on 4 January Bruno Tabacci, leader of Democratic Centre, a party that had a parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies, announced that his party would be allied with More Europe, exonerating the list from the collection of signatures. The list then announced an agreement with the Democratic Party and its centre-left coalition.  \nThe list ran in the centre-left coalition but they got 2.56% of votes in the Chamber of Deputies, falling short to the threshold of 3% for the proportional seats, but elected three deputies in the single-member constituencies, Riccardo Magi in the constituency of Rome 10, Bruno Tabacci in the constituency of Milan 1, and Alessandro Fusacchia, elected from the Italians abroad in Europe; while in the Senate of the Republic they got 2.37% of votes, electing one senator, Emma Bonino in the constituency of Rome 1.\n\n### The transition to a party  \nAfter the election, the future of More Europe was unclear. The Statute envisaged a deadline for the party at 30 June 2018: if the founding parties could not reach a unanimity agreement by that date, the party would have been dissolved. The leader Emma Bonino, during a press conference held two days after the elections, expressed her wish to continue with the project. However, the founding parties were divided on how to proceed and what would become More Europe. The proposal of Olivier Dupuis of the creation of a federated party was opposed by that of Riccardo Magi, who proposes to make of More Europe a pan-European confederation, maintaining the unanimity system of the founding parties.  \nThen the President of More Europe Gianfranco Spadaccia presented a proposal that foresees a transitional Statute, introduces the role of a Coordinator and the creation of an Executive Council composed by 15 members (5 from each of the founder parties), the direct recruitment of individual citizens as members, a constituent congress to be held before the European elections that establishes the definitive statute. Magi presented a counter-proposal that partially accepted Spadaccia's one, on condition that 6,000 members were reached by 31 May 2019. In collaboration with Magi, Spadaccia makes the final proposal, which is approved unanimously by the three political subjects before the deadline, which provides for the appointment of a coordinator and two deputies and sets the date for the congress for January 2019. On July 14 the Council is officially established and Benedetto Della Vedova is elected as Coordinator, while Bruno Tabacci and Massimiliano Iervolino are elected deputies, and finally, Silvja Manzi is elected administrator. On 8 August More Europe officially opened the individual membership recruitment during a press conference and finally on 15 September the name of Emma Bonino was removed from the electoral logo of More Europe.  \n## Procedure  \nThe new Statute that will come into force starting from the next Congress, after its approval and the approval of the amendments, provides for the election of a Secretary, the Directorate, the Treasurer and the Assembly. The statute that will be approved during the Congress will be federal, but the system of unanimous voting will be put aside. The Assembly must call a new Congress every two years.  \nWith the convocation of the Congress made by the coordinator Della Vedova on 22 December, the Congress officially began. Applications must be filed for the Secretary and for the Assembly by 16 January (while subscriptions from the members last from 13 to 18 January), the former supported by at least one-tenth of the members as of 31 December 2018, 200 members, and up to a maximum of 1,000, the latter supported by at least 50 members, up to a maximum of 70. The candidates to Secretary must also present a list of 10 people who will be elected to the Assembly in case of victory of their Secretary, ensuring the minimum presence of each gender of 30%. The candidate lists for the Assembly must present a top candidate followed by at least five other candidates, once they are validated, each list must have at least 25 candidates, up to a maximum of 60, ensuring the minimum presence of each gender of 30%. Finally, the amendments must be supported by at least 200 members before 18 January.  \nThe signing of the candidates to the Secretary, the lists to the Assembly and the amendments are reserved only to the members of More Europe, who can support only one single candidate or proposal for an office and can subscribe to them from the More Europe website. The election takes place by the vote of those members who are present during the Congress at Milan, and it's not possible to delegate one's vote to others.  \nThe Assembly is composed of 100 members, of which 10 are elected with the list of the Secretary and 90 are elected proportionately by the Congress on the basis of the percentage obtained by the lists that have applied to run for the Assembly. The Treasurer and the Secretary are elected by simple majority voting of the members and their term of office lasts for two years, the President is elected from the Assembly by simple majority voting, while the Directorate is composed of 22 members of the Assembly, the Secretary, the Treasurer, the President of the Assembly, the candidates for Secretary who obtained at least 20% of the votes, the first three elected from the Secretary's list by the Assembly, two members for each of the founding parties (RI, FE and CD), and finally the representatives selected by each of the founding parties, for a maximum limit of 25% of the number of elected members of the Assembly.  \n### Timetable  \n## Campaign  \n<ImageHere>A speech from a member of the European Federalist Movement during the Congress.\nThe first one to announce his candidacy was Marco Cappato on 10 December. Secretary and then Treasurer of the Associazione Luca Coscioni, Cappato has been fighting for the legalization of euthanasia in Italy for years. In 2017 he helped Fabiano Antoniani, known as Dj Fabo, a quadriplegic man, to take him to a clinic in Switzerland to practice assisted suicide. Once back in Italy, Cappato denounced himself to the police and in October 2018 the Constitutional Court requested the Parliament to fill the legislative gap within a year. In his program, among the main points, he promoted the cutting of structural funds for EU countries that don't respect human rights, a European mobilization on climate and global warming and the promotion of an EU seat at the UN Security Council.  \nOutgoing Coordinator Benedetto Della Vedova was the other challenger in Congress. President of Forza Europa, coming from the experience of Libertiamo, his candidacy was focused on the concerns of the economic conditions of Italy and the intensification of tensions, hoping for a role of aggregation from the European Union.  \nThe last to express his candidacy was the member of the Chamber of Deputies Alessandro Fusacchia, who proposed a collective leadership in the party, the valorisation of local groups and the promotion of activities through the online exchange of ideas and opinions, exploiting new technologies.\n\n### Radaelli's candidacy  \nOne day before the deadline for submitting nominations as Secretary, Paola Renata Radaelli's candidacy was admitted, managing to collect the 200 subscriptions required to take part at the Congress on 25\u201327 January. She's the president of the \"Victims National Union\", which aims to harsher penalties against offenders, a position far apart from those of More Europe in defence of prisoners, she supported the League's reform of the self-defence, on his social profiles she published photos with her and Matteo Salvini, leader of the populist and eurosceptic right-wing party of the League, Massimiliano Fedriga and Magdi Cristiano Allam (both right-wing politicians), she ran in 2012 in the municipal elections of Genoa for The Right, a eurosceptic right-wing party, and she joined \"Culture Identity\", a radical right and identitarian study center. The list that supported her candidacy in the Assembly, \"In Europe yes, but not like that\", had as top candidate Gerardo Meridio, national coordinator of Moderates in Revolution, the party of Gianpiero Samor\u00ec founded for the primaries of the centre-right of 2012 that were then cancelled. On top of that, the members' increase made believes that there was an attempt to win the Congress by registering other people close to her candidacy. Piercamillo Falasca on his social media claimed that it was a \"hostile takeover\" organized by a \"group of sovereignists\", while Silvja Manzi, administrator of More Europe, confirmed that the members' increase was \"unusual\", promising thorough checks. Marco Cappato then asked the administrator Silvja Manzi to have access to the registration data and to check if they had been paid more registrations with the same credit card. Silvja Manzi actually found out that 191 registrations, including that of Radaelli and Gerardo Meridio, were irregular, resulting in the exclusion of her candidacy and the list linked to her.  \n## Debates  \nThere were three leadership election debates held across Italy during the electoral campaign.  \n## Candidates  \n### Secretary  \n#### Validated  \n#### Invalidated  \n* Paola Renata Radaelli \u2014 President of the Victims National Union (2017\u2013present). Announced her intention to run on 17 January 2019. Invalidated on 23 January 2019.  \n### Assembly Lists  \n### Endorsements  \n#### Marco Cappato  \n#### Benedetto Della Vedova  \n## Results  \n### Secretary  \n### Assembly  \n## Aftermath  \nSome activists denounced the presence of buses who unloaded members arrived in Milan just to vote in the last day, in exchange for the payment of food, accommodation and travel, receiving instructions on whom to vote for. The main suspects behind the operation were Bruno Tabacci and the former candidate for mayor of Palermo Fabrizio Ferrandelli, who supported Benedetto Della Vedova at the Congress. Della Vedova initially said he knew nothing, while Tabacci challenged the idea that voters arrived by bus were unaware of what they were voting, claiming the use of buses to make people vote from all over Italy. It was discovered that two of those elected to the Assembly in the Tabacci's list were part of the list (later excluded) of Paola Renata Radaelli.  \nMichele Boldrin, one of the external supporter of Marco Cappato, said that Della Vedova must \"start to be ashamed\", while Emma Bonino, the founder, preferred not to comment on the incident. Then Cappato asked Della Vedova and Fusacchia to make a joint lodge complaint with the authority competent to start inspections if necessary, an initiative welcomed by Ferrandelli, who also asked him to focus on external enemies instead of feeding the internal suspects. However, in a video posted on Facebook, Tabacci accused the Radicals that they did not accept the results of the Congress and the victory of Della Vedova, and he accused Boldrin, de Blasi and Cappato that they had caused the controversy of the buses. Cappato challenged the accusation by saying that he recognized the results of the Congress but did not accept the methods by which it took place. Later, Della Vedova announced his intention to understand what happened during the Congress, without expressing support for the Cappato proposal.  \nThe deputy Alessandro Fusacchia, one of the challengers to the Secretary, asked Della Vedova to investigate the incident, accepting the proposal of Cappato, otherwise, he would have dissolved the party group in the Chamber of Deputies. One week after the Congress, Cappato announces that he no longer wanted to be part of the governing bodies of More Europe, until the case has been cleared, and regretting the silence of the party leaders.\n\nQuestion: Which individual was involved in assisting Fabiano Antoniani, also known as Dj Fabo, with traveling to a clinic in Switzerland for assisted suicide and subsequently denounced themselves to the Italian police?\nChoice list: \nA.

It comprises various disciplines in which sportsmen from the provinces and departments of Pakistan compete against each other. The games are organized by Pakistan Sports Board, Pakistan Olympic Association, and the host province.  \nPakistan Army have dominated the Games throughout their history, having won 28 of the 34 official editions. Lahore has hosted the Games ten times, more than any other city.  \n## History  \nBefore the Independence of Pakistan, the Indian chapter of the Olympic movement was founded in 1924. The founder was Hassan, the first Secretary of the Punjab Olympic Association. Lt. Col. H.L.O. Garrett, vice principal of Government College, Lahore, was the President of the founding body. At the same time, the Indian Olympic Games were organized in Delhi, Calcutta, and Lahore, the then capital of undivided Punjab.  \nThe Games were held every two years from 1924 as Indian Olympic Games and were renamed as National Games when they were first held in Bombay in 1940.  \n### Post-independence  \nAfter the independence of Pakistan, the first National Games were held at Polo Ground, Karachi from 23 to 25 April 1948. The games were organized by Ahmed E.H. Jaffar, the first President of the Pakistan Olympic Association.  \nSportsmen and officials from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and all the integrated Provincial units of West Pakistan took part in these Games. The total number of athletes was 140. No competitors were, however, invited from any foreign country. Competitions were held in track and field, basketball, boxing, cycling, volleyball, weightlifting, and wrestling.  \nThe overall championship was won by the Punjab contingent.  \n## The Quaid-i-Azam Trophy  \nThe inaugural edition of the National Games was opened by the founder and Governor-General of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He donated a \"Challenge Shield\" from his private funds. The trophy is now named as the \"Quaid-i-Azam Trophy\", and is awarded to the winning team in every edition.  \n## Organization  \nThe National Games are required to be held once in two years leaving those years in which the Olympic Games and Asian Games are scheduled to be held, depending upon the situation in country. The Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) can allow relaxation from the general rule only in exceptional cases or natural calamity. The duration and the regulation of the National Games is entirely within the jurisdiction of POA.  \nThe games are jointly organized by the Pakistan Sports Board, the Pakistan Olympic Association, and the provincial government of the host city.  \n## Editions  \n<ImageHere>Contingents from Pakistan Army have dominated the Games, having won 28 of the 34 official editions.\n\n<ImageHere>Lahore has hosted the Games ten times, more than any other city.\n\n\n## Sports  \nIn the 34th edition of the National Games, held in Quetta in 2023, over 6,000 athletes participated in 32 different sports encompassing 57 events.  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=1  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=1  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=1  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=1  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=1  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=1  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=2  \n* Events=1  \n* Events=2  \nFour exhibition events \u2013 futsal, canoeing and kayaking, throwball, and women's cricket \u2013 were also part of the 2023 edition.\n\nQuestion: Which city has hosted the Games mentioned in the images more times than any other city?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# William W. Smith (admiral)  \nWilliam Ward Smith (February 8, 1888 \u2013 May 20, 1966) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A graduate of the Naval Academy and participant of several conflicts, he distinguished himself during World War II as Commander, Cruiser Task Force during the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway in May and June 1942.  \nFollowing his not very successful command of naval forces during the Aleutian Islands campaign, he was relieved of command and transferred to the administrative post as Director, Naval Transportation Service, where he remained for the rest of the War. In May 1946, Smith was appointed Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission and held this assignment until April 1949.  \n## Early career  \nWilliam Ward Smith was born on February 8, 1888, in Newark, New Jersey, the son of farmer Samuel Hamilton Smith and Elizabeth Zelander, and moved as a child with his family to Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey. He graduated from the Springfield High School in June 1905 and earned an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. While at the academy, Smith was nicknamed \"Poco\", which was an abbreviation of \"Pocahontas\" and was given to him by an academy upperclassman, who suggested that his dark complexion and prominent nose showed he was an illegitimate descendant of the famous Native American woman. Smith was also active in track, football and Naval Academy Rifle Team and received badge as Sharpshooter Expert. He was also awarded the Class of 1871 Sword for excellence in practical and theoretical ordnance and gunnery.  \nAmong his classmates were several future admirals including future four-star admirals Alan G. Kirk, Jesse B. Oldendorf; vice admirals Alva D. Bernhard, Levin H. Campbell Jr., Olaf M. Hustvedt, Monroe Kelly, Theodore S. Wilkinson; and rear admirals Howard H. J. Benson, Joel W. Bunkley, Freeland A. Daubin, Sherman S. Kennedy, Benjamin McCandlish, Harold C. Train, Clifford E. Van Hook.  \nSmith graduated third in his class as Passed Midshipman with Bachelor of Science degree on June 4, 1909, and was assigned to the battleship Michigan, operating with the Atlantic Fleet. He took part in the training maneuvers off New England and was transferred to the recently commissioned battleship North Dakota in September 1910. Smith participated in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises, fleet maneuvers, and gunnery drills in the Atlantic and in the Caribbean and took part in a good-will visit to Great Britain and France.  \nOn June 4, 1911, Smith was commissioned Ensign after serving two years at sea required then by law. He was subsequently detached from North Dakota and sent to Wakefield, Massachusetts, where he trained with the Navy Rifle Team. Smith then took part in the National Rifle Matches at Camp Perry, Ohio, and was assigned to the armored monitor Monterey, operating with the Asiatic Station at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay at Olongapo, Philippines. With the outbreak of Chinese revolution, Monterey was ordered to Amoy, China, to protect American interests and several days later to Fuzhou and Shantou with same mission. Smith was a member of the landing parties on each occasion and then returned to Olongapo, where he assumed command of dry dock Dewey.  \nWhile in this capacity, Smith was promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 5, 1914, and assumed command of Hull Division at Subic Bay. He was later transferred to the gunboat Wilmington and took part in patrolling in the Chinese waters, before he was ordered back to the United States in October that year. Smith was assigned back to the battleship North Dakota, where he served in 1910 and subsequently to the battleship Utah operating in the Atlantic.  \nIn July 1915, Smith was ordered to Washington, D.C., where he was assigned to the Office of Naval Communications under Captain William H. G. Bullard. Following the United States' entry into World War I, Smith was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on June 5, 1917, and continued in his service in the Office of Naval Communications until early 1918. He was subsequently ordered to Europe and served successively aboard destroyers Downes and Allen off the coast of Queenstown, Ireland.  \nSmith was later transferred to the staff of Commander, Destroyer Flotillas operating in the European waters and served as Aide to Captain Joseph K. Taussig until the end of War. For his service during the War, Smith was decorated with a Special Letter of Commendation by the Navy Department and Order of Leopold by Belgium. He was also promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant commander.  \n## Interwar period  \nSmith as captain in 1941  \nFollowing his return to the United States in February 1919, Smith assumed command of destroyer Fairfax and commanded her within the patrols along the East coast and in the Caribbean, before he took her to the Azores in May 1919 to take up station as an observer of the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic made by Navy seaplanes. He was transferred to command of destroyer Herbert in October 1920 and resumed his patrol duties along the East coast.  \nIn March 1921, Smith was ordered to the Bureau of Engineering and served under Rear Admiral John K. Robison until August 1923, when he was ordered back for sea duty to command of destroyer Williamson. He led Williamson during the series of gunnery drills off New York City and participated in the maneuvers with the Scouting Fleet. Smith was transferred to the staff of Commander, Scouting Fleet in February 1925 and served as Aide and Flag Secretary to Vice Admiral Josiah S. McKean.  \nSmith remained in that assignment until September 1926, when he was promoted to commander and reported for duty to Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, as Manufacturing officer. By the end of July 1929, he was appointed commanding officer of gunboat Sacramento operating with the Special Service Squadron in Central American Waters. Smith participated in the patrols along the coast of Nicaragua during the protection of American interests there and was commended by the Secretary of the Navy, Charles F. Adams III for salvaging the steamer Heilo, which had run aground at the entrance of Harbor of Corinto and was blocking the entrance to that harbor. He also received Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit with Diploma from President Adolfo D\u00edaz.  \nIn June 1931, Smith was sent back to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and assumed duty as Executive officer for the Commandant of Midshipmen, Henry D. Cooke. While in this capacity, he was co-responsible for the professional development and day-to-day activities of all 4,500 Midshipmen in the Cadet-Brigade. Smith remained in that capacity under following Commandant of Midshipmen, Ralston S. Holmes until June 1934, when he was appointed an Executive officer of cruiser Salt Lake City.  \nFollowing the period of sea duty off the West Coast of the United States, Smith reported as Aide and Fleet Operations officer on the staff of Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet under Admiral Joseph M. Reeves and served in this capacity until June 1936, when he was ordered for his third tour to the Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was subsequently appointed Head of the Department of Mathematics and while in this capacity, he was promoted to captain on March 1, 1937.  \n## World War II  \n<ImageHere>Smith (right) confers with Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, (center) and his Operations Officer and Assistant Chief of Staff, Captain Walter S. DeLany (left), at Pearl Harbor, 1941.\n\n<ImageHere>At a shipboard awards ceremony, held at Pearl Harbor on June 17, 1942. The officers are (left to right): William L. Calhoun, Frank J. Fletcher, Thomas C. Kinkaid, Smith, Marc A. Mitscher and Robert H. English.\nIn May 1939, Smith assumed command of light cruiser Brooklyn and patrolled the Atlantic along the East Coast of the United States in the opening weeks of the War. The Brooklyn was later transferred to the Pacific and participated in the opening of the Golden Gate International Exposition in February 1940. Smith then commanded his ships during the patrols along the West Coast until February 1941, when he was ordered to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for new assignment.  \nSmith subsequently assumed duty as chief of staff and aide to the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet under Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and served in this capacity at the time of the surprise Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Smith himself was located at his quarters at Fort DeRussy and witnessed the attack on Pacific Fleet ships on Oahu.  \nUnlike Admiral Kimmel, Smith survived personnel changes following the attack and continued under new Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Chester Nimitz as his Administrative Chief of Staff. He remained in that assignment until January 8, 1942, when he was promoted to the rank of Rear admiral and assumed duty as Commander, Cruiser Task Force Eleven, consisting of cruisers Astoria, Chester and Portland.  \nSmith commanded his ships as the cruiser escort for Task Force 17 centered around aircraft carrier Yorktown and took part in the battles of the Coral Sea in May 1942 and Midway in June that year. The units under his command caused the infliction of heavy damage on attacking Japanese air forces with ultimate success for U.S. forces in these distinctive engagements. Unfortunately the aircraft carrier Yorktown was sunk at Midway on June 7, 1942. For his leadership during that battles, Smith was decorated with Navy Distinguished Service Medal.  \nBy the end of June, Smith assumed command of Cruiser Division 9, comprising heavy cruisers Indianapolis and Louisville. He then sailed to North Pacific, where he was given additional duty as Commander of surface elements of North Pacific Force. He subsequently led his forces during the bombardment of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands and arrived off the island on the beginning of August 1942.  \nSmith subsequently ordered his seaplanes for reconnaissance mission, but all were promptly shot down or driven off by the defending Japanese Rufe seaplane fighters, which then directed Japanese coastal artillery against Smith's force. He then ordered bombardment of Japanese positions at the harbor, but due to dense fog all shells missed the Japanese facilities by half a mile. Smith's displeased superior admiral, Frank J. Fletcher relieved Smith in late 1942 and succeeded him with Charles McMorris.  \nSmith was ordered back to the United States and reported for duty as Director of Naval Transportation Service in Washington, D.C., in January 1943, remaining in that capacity for the next two years and was responsible for the coordination and administration of troop and supply ships. During his tenure, the number of merchant\u2011type vessels commissioned by and allocated to the Navy increased from 150 to 500. For his service in this capacity, Smith received the Navy Commendation Medal.  \nOn March 6, 1945, Smith was promoted to the temporary rank of Vice admiral and assumed command of Service Force, Pacific Fleet with headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While in this capacity, he was responsible for the Oilers, Gasoline Tankers, Repair Ships, Ammunition Ships, Destroyer Tenders and Submarine tenders of the Pacific Fleet.\n\n## Postwar service  \nFollowing the War, Smith was appointed a member of the General Board of the Navy in February 1946 and three months later was appointed Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission as substitute for Vice admiral Emory S. Land. While in this capacity, Smith was an advocate of strong American merchant marine operated by private enterprise and during his tenure, the contracts on construction of luxury ocean liners, United States, Independence and Constitution and were ordered. Smith was criticized by the U.S. Senate for overpriced contracts and retired in April 1949.  \nIn 1950, Smith was appointed Vice President of Fruehauf Trailer Corporation of Detroit, Michigan, and remained in that capacity until 1956. He was subsequently appointed a President of the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association and served in this capacity for one year.  \nVice Admiral William W. Smith died on May 20, 1966, aged 78, in Bethesda, Maryland, and was buried with full military honors at United States Naval Academy Cemetery at Annapolis, Maryland.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# St Mary Magdalene's Church, Bolney  \nSt Mary Magdalene's Church is an Anglican church in the village of Bolney in Mid Sussex, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex.  The parish church, which is dedicated to Jesus' companion Mary Magdalene, serves a large rural parish centred on a village straddling the ancient London\u2013Brighton road and apparently dates from about 1100, and an older origin has been suggested.  Many structural additions have been made over the centuries\u2014including a tower built solely using the labour of villagers\u2014and at the entrance to the churchyard is a \"magnificent\"  20th-century lychgate made of local materials including Sussex Marble. The church is protected as a Grade I Listed building.  \n## History  \nBolney is on the ancient London\u2013Brighton road about km north of Brighton and km southeast of the market town of Horsham.  The main road now bypasses the village to the east.  Neither a settlement nor a church was recorded in the Domesday survey of 1086.  The parish was first recorded as Bolneya or Bolne in the 13th century, and was one of 12 in the Hundred of Buttinghill in the Rape of Lewes.  Despite the absence of earlier written records, some sources date the present church's origins to about 1100, around the start of the Norman era, and most others attribute it to that period without specifying a date.  One study, however, suggested an earlier construction date based on the design and decoration of the south doorway, which was stated to have little in common with standard Norman work: comparisons were drawn instead with similar Saxon doorways at 8th- to 11th-century churches elsewhere in England and at nearby Wivelsfield.  \nThe 16th-century tower was erected solely by the efforts of villagers.  \nThe church was built on hilly ground overlooking Bolney from the south, and was reached by a twitten (a narrow lane) from the village street.  The core of the Norman building consisted of a nave, a narrower chancel set at an angle, one window in the east wall and the doorway in the south wall of the nave.  To this was added the main east window in the end of the chancel\u2014a large traceried window dating from about 1300.  The south wall of the chancel has a window of a similar date, and on the same wall is a 13th-century piscina.  \nThe next structural alteration, a west tower that \"dominates the church\", came in 1536\u201338: the date is known precisely because details of costs and progress were recorded in the churchwarden's record book, which still exists.  The churchwarden at the time was John Bolney, also a significant and wealthy landowner in the parish, whose family was long established in the area.  Described as the \"moving spirit\" behind \"an inspired community effort involving the whole village\", he paid for the tower to be built and arranged for dozens of villagers to use their skills and any money they could offer to quarry the sandstone, cut and shape it, build temporary bridges and paths to transport the material to the church, build tools and wooden scaffolding, and erect the adj=on tall, adj=on structure at the west end of the church.  The project was completed in 1538, and a new west doorway was inserted below John Bolney's coat of arms and the commemorative wording This Stepl is 66 Foot high.  \n<ImageHere>The oak and Sussex Marble lychgate dates from 1905.\nThe church continued to expand as the congregation grew.  A west gallery for choristers was inserted in 1670\u2014an early example of the practice, common in Sussex, of building accommodation for a choir at the west end of a church so the congregation could face them when they sang.  Organs were sometimes too expensive for churches to buy, so choral music by local singers was often preferred instead.  West-end galleries only became prevalent in Sussex churches in the early 18th century, though.  A porch was built on the south side in 1718, enclosing the Saxon/Norman doorway; and as part of a Victorian restoration, the capacity was increased in 1853 when the nave was extended with a north aisle.  A clock was added to the tower in 1898 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.  A vestry was added in 1912, and general work was carried out in the nave and chancel during the 1930s.  A modern stained glass window by prolific Sussex-based firm Cox & Barnard was inserted in the south aisle in 1982; it depicts a rural scene.  \nThe Huth family were important in church life in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Henry Huth was a bibliophile whose enormous collection of rare books was sold for \u00a3300,000 in 1910 (\u00a3 in ).df=y  He lived in an extravagant ch\u00e2teau-style 1870s house called Wykehurst Place in the parish, and was buried in the churchyard after his death in 1878.  In 1905, his son Edward gave the church a large, \"magnificent\" lychgate constructed from local materials: oak, millstones from a mill in the parish, Sussex Marble (a locally quarried limestone) and a Horsham Stone slab roof.  It stands at the end of the twitten leading to the churchyard, which has been left slightly overgrown to conserve wildlife.  A mid-19th-century rector planted the churchyard and rectory grounds with a wide range of trees, many of which survive\u2014including Bhutan pines and oaks from Somerset.   There are many Victorian tombs and grave-markers in the churchyard, including some rare wooden grave-boards and some with wooden cross-pieces set between stone balls.  Another of Huth's sons, Alfred Henry Huth\u2014who also became a book-collector and author, and who died in 1910\u2014is commemorated by a memorial tablet inside the church; its style was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \"neo-late 17th-century\".\n\n## Architecture  \nThe south porch was added in 1718.  \nThe church consists of a nave, an angled chancel offset slightly towards the north, a adj=on tower at the west end, a north aisle,  separated from the nave by a three-bay pointed-arched arcade, a vestry on the north side and an entrance porch on the south side.  There are other entrances in the base of the tower and its stair-turret.  The nave is m long and m wide; the chancel measures m and has walls of m thickness.  They are separated by a chancel arch.  The walls are of rubble laid in courses with sandstone dressings, except for the tower (which is ashlar) and the Victorian north aisle, whose walls are in the style of crazy paving.  The east windows in the chancel and north aisle have y-tracery, and a small oculus is set below the gable of the chancel wall above the main window.  The roof is tiled with Horsham Stone.  \nThe two-stage tower has mouldings defining its upper and lower stages, and stands on a moulded plinth.  Diagonal corner buttresses provide support.  A stair-turret topped with a parapet is attached on the north side.  The tower itself terminates in a squared-off parapet with \"heavy\" pinnacles which Nikolaus Pevsner considered to be 17th-century.  They are topped by tapering finials with weather vanes.  Above the Perpendicular Gothic west doorway, which has \"nicely carved\" and moulded spandrels and a four-centred arch, are John Bolney's coat of arms (whose heraldic description is Or a crescent with two molets gules in the chief) and the inscription This Stepl is 66 Foot high which was added in 1538 upon completion of the tower.  A peal of eight bells is set in a bell-chamber near the top of the tower, lit by four two-light, flat-arched windows.  The church is well known for this large complement of bells and the regular bellringing that takes place, and the ancient pub opposite the church is named The Eight Bells in recognition of this.  \nThis war memorial plaque bears the name of Captain A Huth.  \nThe south doorway, described as the \"best\" and \"most interesting architectural feature\" of the church, is narrow, tall and surrounded by bands of characteristically Norman reeding similar to the style of nearby St Peter and St John the Baptist's Church in Wivelsfield.  It has a splayed inner archway with re-cut imposts.  Nine voussoirs make up the arch.  The dimensions on the inside are cm wide, m high to the top of the arch and cm deep.  The \"extremely interesting\" decoration on the exterior consists of carved v-shapes (not identical to standard Norman chevron ornamentation) with inward- and outward-facing points at various intervals.  \nA common feature on the south side of ancient churches was a mass dial\u2014a type of sundial that served as a \"do-it-yourself clock\".  They consisted of circular markings engraved in a wall, with lines dividing the hours and a hole in which to place a gnomon or stick.  At Bolney there is one scratched into a stone dressing on the southeast side of the nave, and another on the jamb of the south doorway.  A large 19th-century sundial is also situated in the gable of the south porch.  \nInside, there are various plaques and stained glass windows commemorating former parishioners; the coat of arms of Queen Anne, painted on a wooden panel above the chancel arch (a \"strangely numerous feature in Sussex\", such decorations are uncommon in England as a whole); 17th-century and more recent oak panelling in the sanctuary; and a 20th-century font.  \n## The church today  \n<ImageHere>East window by Burlison and Grylls, c. 1905\nSt Mary Magdalene's Church was designated a Grade I Listed building on 28 October 1957.  \nThe ecclesiastical parish of Bolney covers a large rural area centred on the village and bisected by the A23 and A272 roads.  It extends towards the villages of Cowfold, Twineham and Warninglid.  Regular Eucharistic and prayer services are held on Sundays and weekdays.  \nThe advowson (the right to appoint clergy) was first recorded in 1316, when it was held by a prebendary linked to Chichester Cathedral.  In the 19th century it was taken up by the Bishop of Chichester himself; in 1901 it passed to Edward Huth in exchange for the advowson of Etchingham parish in East Sussex.  Huth, an alumnus of Exeter College, Oxford, passed it to the college in 1929.\n\n\nQuestion: Which feature was donated by Edward Huth to the church in 1905?\nChoice list: \nA.

The song was performed by Canadian actress Cobie Smulders in the role of Robin Scherbatsky, who has a secret past as a teenage Canadian pop star under the stage name Robin Sparkles. A follow-up to \"Let's Go to the Mall\" (2006), \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" was inspired by several 1980s pop ballads. The song was made available for streaming on April\u00a015, 2008, before it appeared in an episode of the same name that aired on April\u00a021. It was released as a single on April\u00a023, and appeared on the soundtrack album How I Met Your Music (2012).  \n\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" is a breakup ballad song about teenage love. The music video was shot at Zuma Beach, California, featuring Tiffany, Alan Thicke, and James Van Der Beek as her love interest. Television and music critics praised the song's humor and compared it to \"Let's Go to the Mall\". It had sold 1,000 digital downloads in the United States as of August\u00a02008, and the music video attracted more than 70,000 views online after 3\u00a0days of release. Smulders later reprised the role of Robin Sparkles in \"Glitter\" (2010) and \"P.S. I Love You\" (2013). Thicke and Van Der Beek also returned in multiple episodes.  \n## Background and recording  \nCobie Smulders played Robin Scherbatsky, a devoted broadcast journalist who moves from Canada for a job in New York, in the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother. In season 2's \"Slap Bet\" (2006), the character was revealed to have been a Canadian teen pop star under the stage name Robin Sparkles. That episode featured the song \"Let's Go to the Mall\", which had sold 4,000 digital downloads in the United States as of August 2008, while its music video received more than 300,000 viewers on MySpace and the CBS official website within the 10\u00a0days of its TV premiere. Smulders was pleased about the favorable reception towards the song, calling it \"hilarious\".  \n<ImageHere>\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" was one of the three original songs written by the creators, Carter Bays and Craig Thomas (pictured), for season 3.\nDuring the production of \"Slap Bet\", creators and executive producers Craig Thomas and Carter Bays had deliberated over the idea of bringing back Robin's musical past in a later season. Thomas revealed that the storyline would mention another song by her that \"wasn't as big a hit\". Bays said that they had to \"somehow build on the storyline or find a new dimension to it,\" and that the song would be \"the perfect way to see another side of Sparkles\". Kourtney Kang, who wrote \"Slap Bet\", had been \"pushing for another Robin Sparkles episode\" and was excited when they got a chance to do it.  \nIn March 2008, Thomas confirmed that there would be an episode featuring Robin Sparkles in season 3, with a B-side song to \"Let's Go to the Mall\". Titled \"Sandcastles in the Sand\", it was one of the three original songs written by Thomas and Bays for season 3, along with \"Ted Mosby is a Jerk\" and \"You Just Got Slapped\". They found the inspiration for \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" from several 1980s pop ballads, particularly Belinda Carlisle's \"Circle in the Sand\" (1988), Debbie Gibson's \"Foolish Beat\" (1988), and Martika's \"Toy Soldiers\" (1989). Smulders spent hours in the recording studio with Thomas, where she changed parts of the audio \"bit by bit\". Thomas noticed her voice became \"raspy\" at nine in the morning. John Swihart, one of the show's composers, advised her to eat a green apple to smoothen it. Thomas and Smulders were pleased with the recording session and the final results. Smulders improvised the line \"I'm on the pill now!\" and it was later added to the song. \"The technology that these studios now have is pretty amazing. Anyone can go in and come out sounding OK, so I have that on my side,\" Smulders said.  \nIn the episode, character Robin Scherbatsky reveals that \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" was a less-successful artistic follow-up to her minor hit \"Let's Go To The Mall\", with both songs released by Dominant Records on an album called Make It Sparkle. It was about her first boyfriend Simon, who led a rock band and had a collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. The couple met while making the music video for the song and broke up behind his van after spending a week and a half together.\n\n## Composition  \nWritten by Bays and Thomas, it is a breakup ballad song with a runtime of 3 minutes and 33 seconds. Lyrically, \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" discusses teenage love. The creators labeled it a \"slow, mournful breakup song\"; Smulders, on the other hand, called it a \"pretty funny\" and \"a love ballad about teen heartbreak\". The song begins with the line, \"Met you at the mall / Didn't know how far I would fall\". She recalls \"the greatest week and a half\" of her life with her love interest: he taught her how to french kiss and they were \"gonna travel the globe / From Alberta to Ontario\". Lines such as \"You're a fool!\", \"Shut up!\", or \"I'm on the pill now!\" can be heard in the background.  \nKelly West of Cinema Blend thought that the song resembles \"every other moany pop-ballad from the 80's\". PopSugar and Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad described it as a \"wistful\", \"touching\", \"overwrought, obviously-written-by-a-16-year-old\" ballad. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a \"heartwrenching B-side\" track, and CBC.ca called it \"campy\". Vlada Gelman of TVLine declared the song a \"temporary foray into semi-serious balladry\". Alyssa Fikse of Uproxx noted similarities from the song to Gibson's power ballad \"Only in My Dreams\" (1986). Fox News interpreted the recording as a \"melodramatic torch song ... near and dear to Robin's heart\".  \n## Music video  \n<ImageHere>The music video was filmed at Zuma Beach, on the coast of Malibu, California.\nAccording to TV Squad, the show began to enlist more guest stars after the ratings success of \"Ten Sessions\", in which Britney Spears appeared in a cameo role. Writer Greg Malins, who had worked with James Van Der Beek, offered him a role in the episode. In March 2008, it was announced that he agreed to play Simon, Sparkles' love interest. A week later, Tiffany and Alan Thicke confirmed their roles as Sparkles' friend and father, respectively. The creators had asked Tiffany to join the show after studying her videos on YouTube. Thicke was a friend of director Pamela Fryman and had worked with her on Hope & Gloria.  \nThe faux music video for \"Sandcastles in the Sand\", and the 60th episode as a whole, was directed by Fryman. It was filmed at Zuma Beach, on the coast of Malibu, California, a week and a half after its parent episode was shot at the 20th Century Fox soundstage. The crew had to hurry to complete filming before the sun set. Bays wanted the video to show Sparkles' origin story and what she was going through, from the \"one time she loved so fully and gave herself over to her heart and got burned real bad by it.\"  \nThe video begins with Sparkles, wearing a long white dress, walking along the beach while singing about her summer love. It then cuts to Sparkles and Simon frolicking on the beach, in one of several black-and-white flashbacks, with Sparkles wearing her jean jacket from \"Let's Go to the Mall\" with no sleeves. Sparkles' girlfriends appear in schoolgirl uniforms as a form of Greek chorus, lip-synching to the lyrics and jumping ropes. An animation shows a van going across a map from Alberta to Ontario; later, handwritten text reads, \"It was the greatest week and a half of my life...R+S 4EVA.\" As the song's chorus begins, Sparkles writes the lyrics into her diary, sitting at a desk on the beach. In a chair behind her, her father smokes a pipe and reads a newspaper. He wears a sweater vest over a button-down shirt, which Eric Goldman of IGN compared to Thicke's appearance in his 1985\u20131992 sitcom Growing Pains. There is a sandcastle with a small Canadian flag on top, and they are surrounded by other furnishings, a grandfather clock and a spinning globe. Robin's sidekick from the \"Let's Go to the Mall\" video, the Omnibot 2000, arrives with flowers to cheer up Sparkles.\n\n## Release  \n\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" appeared in an episode of the same name that aired on April\u00a021, 2008. The song was fully made available for streaming on April\u00a015 on the official website of Variety. On April\u00a023, it was released as a digital single by 20th Century Fox Records and Fox Music. The song was later included in the compilation album How I Met Your Music (2012). The video premiered online on April 18; brief clips had been posted on MySpace three days earlier. Similar to \"Let's Go to the Mall\", only portions of the video were shown in its parent episode. The full four-minute footage became available on MySpace and CBS.com after its TV premiere; there was a tag at the end of the episode that encouraged viewers to watch the full video online. It was also included in the show's season\u00a03 DVD release.  \n\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" garnered generally positive reviews from both television and music critics. Fox News called it a \"worthy follow-up\" to \"Let's Go to the Mall\". Writing in 2011, Gelman felt that it did not live up to \"Let's Go to the Mall\", but that the video's casting compensated for any weaknesses of the song. TVLine placed it in a tie for fourth place among the show's \"Best Song and Dance Moments\".  Joel Keller of TV Squad said that it was \"the funniest part\" of a \"full of eighties and nineties goodness\" episode. Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk thought that the video \"totally exploits Robin's Canadian heritage\" and is \"one of the funniest things\" from the show. Mickey O'Connor of TV Guide felt that the song was \"made of crack cocaine, and will be stuck in your head all day.\"  \nFikse found that the storyline solidified Sparkle's status as a \"one-hit wonder\" and the video \"was just as hilarious\" as \"Let's Go to the Mall\". She commended Thicke and Van Der Beek's appearances, which show \"how absurdly behind Canada was with its pop culture\". Michelle Zoromski of IGN also praised their cameo performances, and cited the \"splendid\" song to be a highlight of the \"notch up\" episode. PopSugar said that the video \"has a great, dated vibe, with a dose of Heidi Montag beach video and an amazingly awkward Dawson-related make-out scene\", and compared it with Wilson Phillips' \"Hold On\" (1990). Writing about its online promotion, Liz Shannon Miller of Gigaom felt that it was \"a great example of... understanding and incorporating\" offline media through online video.\"  \nThe \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" episode received a 3/8\u00a0Nielsen rating/share in the 18\u201349 demographic and attracted 8.45\u00a0million American viewers.

He served many times as the legate to Perugia and was both a Senator of Milan and ran the archdiocese from 1485-1488.\n\n## Biography  \nGiovanni Arcimboldi was born in Parma or Milan in 1421 or 1426. He was the son of Nicol\u00f2 Arcimboldo (maestro delle Entrate Straordinarie of Filippo Maria Visconti) and his wife Orsina Canossa (descendant of the family of Matilda of Tuscany).  \nHe was educated at the University of Pavia, receiving a doctorate of both laws in 1458. He also studied letters under Italian Renaissance humanist Francesco Filelfo and later maintained a correspondence with Filelfo.  \nEarly in his life, he married Briseide Pietrasanta, and had a daughter, Briseide Arcimboldi. He also later fathered nine illegitimate children.  \nIn July 1458, through the influence of Francesco I Sforza, he gained admission to Milan's prestigious Collegio di Giureconsulti. He afterwards became a Senator of the Duchy of Milan. Francesco I Sforza sent Arcimboldi to Rome as his ambassador to the Holy See.  \nAfter the death of his wife, Arcimboldi entered the ecclesiastical state.  He received the four minor orders in September 1461. On September 20, 1466, he was ordained as a subdeacon by the suffragan bishop of Milan. In October 1466, Pope Paul II made him a protonotary apostolic. He also became a canon of Pavia Cathedral and Piacenza Cathedral at this time.  \nOn November 20, 1468, he was elected Bishop of Novara. He took possession of the see in May 1469, but stayed there only a few days before he was called away by Galeazzo Maria Sforza to serve as his ambassador to Pope Sixtus IV, a post he held from May 1472 until February 1473.  \nIn the consistory of May 7, 1473, Pope Sixtus IV made Arcimboldi a cardinal priest. He received the titular church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo on May 17, 1473. He entered Rome on November 24, 1473 and received the red hat on December 10, 1473. The pope then named him Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, an office he held until his death. On May 31, 1476, he was elected temporary Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals in the absence of Cardinal Jacopo Piccolomini-Ammannati. He opted for the titular church of Santa Prassede on December 30, 1476.  \nOn January 15, 1477, Pope Sixtus IV named him legate a latare to Perugia. On February 7, 1477, his legation was extended to include the Kingdom of Hungary, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bohemia.  \nDuring the outbreak of bubonic plague, he again served as temporary Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, from May 19 to June 5, 1482. He was then elected to a full term as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals on January 15, 1483 and held this post until January 19, 1484. On November 15, 1483, Pope Sixtus IV named him legate to Perugia for a second time.  \nFollowing the death of Sixtus IV, Cardinal Arcimboldi participated in the papal conclave of 1484 that elected Pope Innocent VIII. In the consistory of September 23, 1484, Innocent VIII confirmed Arcimboldi's appointment as legate to Perugia, and Arcimboldi left on his legation on October 11, 1484, returning to Rome on January 15, 1485.  \nMeanwhile, on October 25, 1484, he had been transferred to the metropolitan see of Milan. He received the pallium on November 12 and took formal possession of the archdiocese via a procurator, Antonio Griffi, on January 1, 1485.  \nHe died in Rome on October 2, 1488. He is buried in the Basilica di Sant'Agostino.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following roles did Giovanni Arcimboldi hold during his lifetime?\nChoice list: \nA. Prime Minister of Italy\nB.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\n<ImageHere>The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783, shows Hood's 6, centre, attacking the French flagship Ville de Paris, right.\nSpear then served in the Western Approaches for the rest of 1780, where Marlborough was again in action at the end of the year, capturing the Dutch 64-gun Prinses Carolina on 30 December 1780. 1781 was spent with the Western squadron, and in January 1782 Spear sailed with his ship for the West Indies with Rodney's fleet. Marlborough was in action at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, sustaining casualties of three killed and sixteen wounded. Following the British victory at the Saintes, Marlborough sailed to North America with Admiral Hugh Pigot in July, and spent between September and October at New York. She was then active in the blockade of Cap-Fran\u00e7ois for the remainder of the war.  Following the signing and ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the war came to an end and Marlborough sailed back to Britain to be paid off.  Spear left the ship and managed to find further employment in the navy.  \nSpear served first aboard the sloop 6, later transferring to the 64-gun 6 and then to the 74-gun 6. It was while serving on Bellona that Spear received his promotion to lieutenant, on 15 October 1790. He went on to serve on the East Indies station as first-lieutenant of the sloop 6.\n\n## French Revolutionary Wars  \nSpear returned to Britain after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and received postings to a number of ships. He was first aboard the 74-gun 6, but later transferred to the 28-gun 6. His later ships were the 74-gun 6 and the 50-gun 6. Spear was serving aboard the latter vessel when she was used to carry Caroline of Brunswick from Cuxhaven to Greenwich in March 1795 for her marriage to the Prince of Wales. He then served aboard the 64-gun 6, the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Vandeput at Halifax. Vandeput promoted Spear to his first command, making him master and commander of the sloop HMS Lily in March 1799.  \nHe remained in command of Lily until 1802, when he transferred to 6, a former 44-gun frigate, now armed en fl\u00fbte, and sailed her back to Britain in February 1803. Britain had been temporarily at peace with France after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, but with the outbreak of war in March 1803, Spear was ordered back to the West Indies, transporting the second battalion of the Royal Scots from Portsmouth to Barbados in June 1803. He landed the troops successfully in Carlisle Bay, and happened to notice a brig passing by flying Dutch colours. Anticipating that war with the Batavian Republic was imminent, Spear sent his boats out and detained the Dutch ship. Two days later Commodore Samuel Hood arrived with despatches announcing that all Dutch ships were to be seized. Hood thanked Spear for his timely action, and the brig, Vrow Elizabeth, and her cargo of coffee and cotton, were sold for \u00a320,000 in prize money.  \n## Napoleonic Wars  \nWith the resumption of the wars, Spear took an active part in the campaign against French and Dutch possessions in the West Indies. He supported the reductions of Saint Lucia, Tobago, Demerara, Essequibo and Berbice, and afterwards escorted a convoy from Tortola to Britain. After refitting Chichester, Spear returned to the Leeward Islands to serve under the station commander, Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane appointed him to several temporary acting commands, at first to the 36-gun 6. While commanding the Ethalion he recaptured the British ship Eliza, which had been captured while carrying provisions from Cork to Antigua. Spear was appointed to command the experimental sloop 6 in January 1806.  Spear's command of Dart was briefly interrupted by a further acting commission, this time as captain of Cochrane's flagship, the 74-gun 6. Spear took part in the pursuit of a French squadron in June 1806 which had recently arrived in the Caribbean under Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez, and was again moved from his ship, this time to become acting captain of the 74-gun 6.  \nReturning to command Dart during the second half of 1806, Spear captured the 8-gun schooner privateer Jeune Gabriella on 9 November 1806, and also recaptured a brig bound from Halifax to Trinidad with a cargo of fish. Dart was sailing in company with the sloop 6 during these events. Spear was transferred to take command of the sloop 6 in 1807, and continued to operate with success against privateers, capturing the 5-gun Nouvelle Entreprise on 27 December 1807. He also captured the Spanish packet ship Firmeza during his time with Nimrod.  \n### Goree vs Pylade and Palinure  \nIn early 1808 Spear was transferred to take command of the sloop HMS Goree, aboard which he continued in the West Indies. While lying at anchor off Marie-Galante on 22 April 1808, two brigs were spotted sailing northwards. Spear determined that they were enemies after they made no response to his private signal, and set off in pursuit. The two brigs, mounting 16 guns each and so constituting the superior force, hauled up and fired on Goree, badly damaging her sails and rigging, and disabling her. They were then forced to flee when another British ship, the 14-gun 6 arrived on the scene. Goree had one man killed and four wounded in the brief engagement, while the two brigs had combined losses of eight killed and twenty-one wounded. The brigs were later discovered to be the French Pylade and Palinure. Palinure was later captured, causing Sir Alexander Cochrane to write in his report  \"the last of the two Palinure which were so gallantly beaten by His Majesty's sloop Goree.\" On his return to Marie-Galante Spear came ashore to be received by the entire garrison drawn up presenting arms, drums playing a march and fifes playing \"Rule, Britannia!\" Cochrane wrote a personal letter to Spear saying \"I am sorry that the spirit and gallantry displayed by yourself, officers, and crew, did not meet with the success which you all so evidently deserved\". Though the action was unsuccessful and therefore not gazetted, the Admiralty acknowledged Spear's deed by confirming the appointment of his acting second-lieutenant Thomas Clack.  \nSpear was then to have transferred from Goree to the sloop 6, pursuant to orders brought out by Commander George Alfred Crofton. Crofton was to supersede Spear in command of Goree, but Crofton observed that \"as a battle often caused officers and men to become more strongly attached to each other, Captain Spear would probably wish to continue in the Goree; in which case he himself had no objection whatever to take the Fawn\". Cochrane approved the gesture, writing out two commissions for Spear and Crofton, leaving the names of the ships blank to allow them to come to a mutual agreement. Spear chose to remain with Goree and Crofton instead took command of Fawn.  \nGoree, with Spear still in command, made one more important capture in 1808, taking the eight-gun privateer General Villaret on 24 November. General Villaret was carrying a cargo of sugar, coffee and cotton at the time of her capture. Spear then assisted in the Invasion of Martinique in early 1809, and was given the honour of carrying Cochrane's despatches back to London, with Cochrane's instructions to the Lords of the Admiralty to apply to Spear for more information, describing him as \"an old and deserving commander\". He arrived on 12 April 1809 and was promptly promoted to post-captain the following day.  \n## Captaincy  \nSpear received his first appointment as a post-captain in April 1810, when he was given command of the 100-gun 6. He commanded her in the Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, maintaining the blockade of Toulon. In March 1811 he was appointed to command the 98-gun 6, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Francis Pickmore, and for the most part the blockade was uneventful. Though possessing a powerful fleet, the French commander avoided any contact with the blockading force and stayed in port, or else made very short voyages, returning to the harbour when the British appeared.  \n<ImageHere>The Mediterranean Fleet blockading Toulon, an 1830 painting by Thomas Luny\nTemeraires one brush with the French during this period came on 13 August 1811. Having received orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hy\u00e8res Bay. As he tried to do so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. The most serious casualty was her master, Robert Duncan, who had one of his legs shot off as he stood talking to Spear. Temeraires boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, she was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Spear was one of those badly affected, and the commander in chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Edward Pellew, ordered him back to Britain with his ship. Health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic. Spear was to have commanded Temeraires replacement in the Mediterranean, the 100-gun 6, but his ill health prevented this.\n\n## Family and later life  \nDespite his eventful career, his low position on the seniority lists meant that Spear never lived to be promoted to flag rank. He died in 1837, still a post-captain. He had been twice married, marrying his first wife Grace Grant, a descendant of Charles Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aboyne, in 1809. After her death he married Grace Grant, a cousin of his first wife.\n\nQuestion: Which naval battle is depicted in the first image provided?\nChoice list: \nA. The Battle of Trafalgar\nB.

Pitz commissioned for the Smithsonian exhibit at the Century of Progress exposition (1933\u20131934)\nHenry Clarence Pitz (June 16, 1895 \u2013 November 26, 1976) was an American artist, illustrator, editor, author, and teacher who wrote and/or illustrated over 160 books, and dozens of magazine covers and articles. His most well-known book is The Brandywine Tradition (1968).\n\n## Life and career  \nPitz was born in Philadelphia in 1895. His father was a bookbinder who immigrated from Germany. Pitz graduated from West Philadelphia High School and was awarded a scholarship to the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art. There Pitz studied illustration and became particularly fond of the work of Howard Pyle. One of  Pitz's instructors at the Museum School was Thornton Oakley, who had been a student of Pyle.  \nHe enlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps in 1917 and became an x-ray technician. He was assigned to Base Camp 56, Allerey, France, assisting Colonel Coates, the unit surgeon. After the war, he returned to Philadelphia. There he began a career of teaching and book illustration, his first notable book being Early American Costume, published by The Century Company of New York.  \nIn 1935, Pitz married Mary \"Molly\" Wheeler Wood. They remained married until his death in 1976. In 1988, she wrote a short summary of his life, now available online.  \nIn the 1930s Pitz joined the monthly magazine American Artist as an associate editor and writer. He was a regular contributor to the magazine for the rest of his life. In 1950 Pitz was elected to the National Academy of Design.  \nIn the 1960s Pitz was commissioned by Houghton, Mifflin and Company to write The Brandywine Tradition, which remained on the best seller list for ten weeks. A few years later, in 1975, Pitz published a comprehensive book on his favorite illustrator, Howard Pyle.  \nHenry Clarence Pitz died at his home in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, on November 26, 1976, after working on a painting the day before.  \n## Partial bibliography  \n<ImageHere>Faery MagicIllustration and poem in St. Nicholas magazine, June 1921\nThe following is a partial list of published works by Pitz:  \n* A Treasury of American Book Illustration (editor).

He was born on 6 September 1870 in Ljungsarp and died in Str\u00f6mstad on 27 December 1953 at the age of eighty-three. A native of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, he had a dental practice in Str\u00f6mstad in Bohusl\u00e4n, where he met the composer David Hellstr\u00f6m.  \nSvenning wrote most of his song lyrics in collaboration with Hellstr\u00f6m although he worked with Theodor Pinet on the well-known Bondvals (Farmer waltz).  Pinet, a popular bandleader and composer, was known as the \u201cBoston King\u201d because of his association with the Boston waltz, a dance popular in Sweden in the early 1900s.  \nIn 1911 Svenning published a collection of verse entitled Sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdss\u00e5nger (Archipelago songs).\n\n## David Hellstr\u00f6m  \nDavid Hellstr\u00f6m was a Swedish composer from the province of Bohusl\u00e4n. He was born on 23 September 1883 in Str\u00f6mstad and died there on 7 April 1965 at the age of eighty-one. As a young man he enlisted in the Royal Bohusl\u00e4n Regiment, where he studied music and played the French horn. He returned to civilian life after attaining the rank of sergeant and from then on worked as a gardener.  \nAfter leaving the military Hellstr\u00f6m continued with his musical activities, composing both waltzes and marches. He often worked with lyricist G\u00f6ran Svenning. In 1907 the two men submitted Kostervalsen in a Bohusl\u00e4n contest for the province\u2019s best new melody. Their entry was disqualified when the jury ruled it was \u201ctoo suggestive\u201d. Despite the setback, the partnership endured and produced many memorable songs.  \nIn 1962 David Hellstr\u00f6m was awarded the Fred Winter prize for his contributions to Swedish music.  \n## Compositions  \nIn America works by Svenning and Hellstr\u00f6m appeared on the Columbia, Edison and Victor labels and were covered by such artists as Arvid Franzen, Lydia Hedberg, Eddie Jahrl, John Lager, Ingeborg Laudon, Eric Olson, Hjalmar Peterson and Charles G. Widd\u00e9n.  \nThe song Friarevalsen (The suitor\u2019s waltz) was given a second life when the producer Emil Norlander borrowed its melody for his revue \"Tokiga Amelie\" (Crazy Amelie).  Norlander, who was a prolific songwriter, wrote new words for the song and called it Balen p\u00e5 bakg\u00e5rden (The dance in the back yard).  \nIn 1914 Svenning and Hellstr\u00f6m wrote Malm\u00f6 valsen (The Malm\u00f6 waltz), also known as P\u00e5 Baltiskan (On the Baltic).  The piece commemorated the Baltic Exhibition of 1914 that was held in Malm\u00f6, Sweden on the eve of the First World War. Hjalmar Peterson and his wife Olga Lindgren recorded the song in 1917 for Columbia Records.  The same year Charles G. Widd\u00e9n recorded S\u00e5ngvals (Song waltz) for Victor Records.  His recording was an adaptation of Malm\u00f6 valsen. It had Hellstr\u00f6m\u2019s melody, some of Svenning\u2019s text and new lyrics that were partly in English.  \n## Songs by Svenning and Hellstr\u00f6m  \n<ImageHere>The Baltic Exhibition 1914\n* Balen p\u00e5 bakg\u00e5rden / Friarevalsen ~ T: Emil Norlander (1910)  \n* Bev\u00e4ringsvals (1912)  \n* Bondvals ~ M: Theodor Pinet (1909)  \n* Bohusl\u00e4nska sj\u00f6mansvalsen (1910)  \n* Brudvalsen  \n* Br\u00f6llopsvalsen  \n* Fiskarvals fr\u00e5n Bohusl\u00e4n (1908)  \n* Friarevalsen (1909)  \n* Hj\u00e4rter\u00f6valsen (1915)  \n* I det soliga bl\u00e5  \n* Kostervalsen (1913)  \n* Kyssvalsen (1914)  \n* K\u00e4restan min  \n* Landsv\u00e4gstrall  \n* Malm\u00f6 valsen / P\u00e5 Baltiskan / The Baltic Exposition Waltz (1914)  \n* Midsommarsvalsen  \n* Ny fiskarvals (1912)  \n* Nya Kostervalsen  \n* Stockholmsvalsen (1916)  \n* S\u00e5ngvals / Malm\u00f6 valsen / (1917)\n\n\nQuestion: Which waltz was composed by the individual depicted in the first image in collaboration with Theodor Pinet, and is also mentioned in the description of the second image?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# Halsewell (East Indiaman)  \nThe Halsewell was an East Indiaman that was wrecked on 6 January 1786 at the start of a voyage from London to Madras.  She lost her masts in a violent storm in the English Channel, and was driven onto  the rocks below a cliff on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, England.  The vicar of nearby Worth Matravers recorded the event in his parish register:  \nOf over 240 crew and passengers, only 74 survived.  The shipwreck shocked the nation.  The King visited the scene of the tragedy.  The wreck of the Halsewell was the subject of poems, paintings and an orchestral symphony. Many years later Charles Dickens described the wreck in a short story.  \n## First voyages  \nThe Halsewell was an East-Indiaman of 776 tons (bm), launched in 1778.  She had three decks, a length of ft and a breadth of ft.  \nThroughout her career she was under the command of Captain Richard Pierce.Halsewell 1786 - Wrecksite  \nOn her maiden voyage the Halsewell sailed to Madras and China, leaving Portsmouth on 6 March 1779 and after stopping at Madeira, Gor\u00e9e and the Cape of Good Hope reached Madras on 18 January 1780.  She then sailed on via Malacca to Whampoa, which she reached on 1 September 1780.  \nOn her return voyage she stopped at Saint Helena on 19 May 1781 and reached the Downs on 20 October 1781.Halsewell 1786 - Wrecksite  \nOn her second voyage the Halsewell left Portsmouth on 11 March 1783, stopped at S\u00e3o Tiago and Johanna and reached Madras on 26 July 1783. The ship returned via Kedgeree, Saugor and Saint Helena, reaching the Downs on 28 August 1784.Halsewell 1786 - Wrecksite  \n## Last voyage  \nEnglish Channel  \nThe Recreation of the Company on board the Halsewell in serene Weather, three Days before their Disolution  \nBefore her last voyage, the Halsewell was considered to be in excellent condition, with an ample and experienced crew.  \nOn 16 November 1785 she dropped down the Thames to Gravesend to take on supplies for her third voyage to the east. At the end of December the passengers boarded at the Hope, including a sizable contingent of soldiers being sent as reinforcements to the East India Company. The passengers included the two daughters of Captain Pierce. Pierce was the oldest of the East India company's captains, and planned to retire after the voyage.  \nThe ship sailed through the Downs on 1 January 1786. The wind died the next day, offshore from the Dunnose headland on the south east of the Isle of Wight, becalming the ship.  \nDuring the afternoon of 2 January a breeze came up from the south, and the ship ran in closer to shore to be able to land the pilot. That evening a snowstorm began and the ship anchored in 18 fathoms of water.  Due to the weather conditions it was not possible to furl all the sails.  On 3 January a violent gale began to blow from east of northeast. The crew cut the anchor cable so the ship could run out to sea. At noon that day they met a brig, who took the pilot, then continued westward down the channel. In the evening the wind increased in strength, now coming from the south.  \nThe gale carried a heavy load of snow.  \nThe crew had to run up most of the sails to avoid being blown on shore. Because she was heeled over, the hawse plugs were washed in and the ship took on large amounts of water on the gun deck.  \nA leak was discovered, with five feet of water in the hold.  The sailors manned all the pumps.  \nIn the morning of 4 January the crew twice tried unsuccessfully to wear the ship. The mizzen-mastA three-masted ship has a fore-mast towards the front, a main mast near the center and the mizzen-mast, usually the shortest of the three, immediately aft of the main-mast. was lost in the process. The leak was too much for the pumps to handle. With seven feet in the hold the ship was near to foundering.  \nThe captain decided to cut away the main mast to reduce the burden.  \nThe fall of the mast carried away five men, who were drowned. The sailors cleared the wreckage and managed to get the ship before the wind. The pumps began to gain on the leak.  \nBy ten in the morning the wind had dropped, and the ship began to roll violently. The foremast was rolled over, destroying the foresail. By eleven the weather had improved and the wind was from the west. Berry Head, the southeast point of Torbay, was seen between six and nine miles distant.  \nThe crew set up a jury main mast and began heading back east towards Portsmouth, spending the rest of the day trying to set up a jury mizzen mast.  \nIn the morning of 5 January the wind began blowing strongly from the south again.  \nAt eight in the evening the Portland lights were observed, from 12 to 15 miles distant in a north of northwest direction.  \nThe crew managed to turn to a westward course, but found that they were running towards shore so changed back to an eastward course, hoping to round Peverel Point and anchor in Studland Bay.  \n## Wreck  \n<ImageHere>Loss of the East Indiaman Halsewell by Robert Smirke\nAt eleven in the evening St Alban's Head was sighted about mi to the leeward.  The crew took all the sails in and released the small bower anchor.  After an hour the ship began to drive towards the shore.  They released a sheet anchor, which held for two hours, when the ship again began to drive towards shore. The captain and the chief officer agreed among themselves that the ship was lost, and decided the officers should be asked to reserve the longboat for the ladies and themselves if possible.  \nAt about two on the morning on 6 January the ship struck violently on the rocks, beating upon them and then falling with her broadside facing the shore. The chief officer told the crew to escape over the rocks if they could.  \nThe ship had struck at the foot of a tall and near-vertical cliff near Seacombe, on the Isle of Purbeck, between Peverel point and St. Alban's head. It had run aground at the mouth of a cave yd deep in the base of the cliff, as wide as the length of the ship. Some of the sailors and soldiers managed to escape to flat rocks below the cliff and others to the rocks in the cave. The passengers and officers, numbering almost fifty people, including three black women and two soldiers' wives, took refuge in the round-house (cabin).  \nThis was destroyed when a heavy sea washed over the wreck.  \nThe same wave carried two men who had seized a hen coop onto the rocks, where they were badly bruised but safe.  \nIt took less than an hour for the ship to be dashed to pieces.  \nThe survivors  who had reached the cave faced the extremely difficult task of gaining rocks above the reach of the tide, and then of finding a way to climb along the base of the cliff, then up to safety. A number died in the attempt.  \nThe first to reach the top of the cliff, the cook and the quartermaster, went for help.  \nWorkmen from a nearby quarry came to the aid of the survivors, hauling them up with ropes.  \nThere were further casualties among the exhausted men during this stage.  \nThere were only 74 survivors.  \nThese included five of the ship's officers, forty seamen and twenty-five soldiers.  \nThe surviving sailors had to make their own way back to London on foot.  \nIt was reported that the \"rapacious plunderers on the sea coast ... are so devoid of humanity as to strip the bodies of the dead as soon as the waves have thrown them on the shore.\" However, some gentlemen of the area had made sure that the bodies were given a proper burial.\n\n## Reactions  \n<ImageHere>Loss of the Halsewell by James Gillray\nKing George III came to view the scene of the wreck with several members of his family.Loss of the Halsewell East-Indiaman UofV  \nThe Dorset poet William Holloway wrote a poem about the royal visit to the spot.  \nAn anonymous poem was published called the \"Monody on the Death of Captain Pierce\".  \nOn 30 January 1786 the Eidophusikon show reopened at Exeter Change in an auditorium that held 200 people, a show that combined pictures with lighting effects and sounds. Opening just three weeks after the tragedy, the new show included an \"exact, awful and tremendous Representation of that lamentable event\".  \nThe show was put on by Philip James de Loutherbourg, a former scenery painter.  \nHenry Meriton and John Rogers, two officers who managed to escape, later published their account of the events.  \nTo commemorate the event, Augustus Frederic Christopher Kollmann composed \"The shipwreck, or the Loss of the East Indiaman Halsewell\", an orchestral symphony.  \nHenry James Pye published a poem that began,  \nPicture from an 1813 account that tries to show all aspects of what happened.  \nIn February 1787 the County Magazine published a poem by George Smith that began,  \nThe wreck was still being discussed fifty years later.  \nThe idea of the father with his two daughters waiting in the roundhouse for their fate,  \nand the scene of the cave below the sheer cliff, added drama to the story.  \nAn 1830 article advocating construction of a breakwater in the Portland Roads between Plymouth and Portsmouth implied that if such a haven had been available, the Halsewell would not have had to make for Portsmouth, and so would not have been wrecked.  \nAn article in The Temperance Tales of 1853 said the wreck \"arose from the drunken desperation of the crew.\"  \nCharles Dickens wrote a short story called \"The Long Voyage\" that recalled the shipwreck, published in 1853.  \nAn 1856 account said that some old people of the region still remembered the wreck, and that sometimes fragments of the ship's timbers and copper were washed ashore or found in the rocks. Many of the ship's guns had been recovered, but more remained at the foot of the cliffs, covered with debris. The mounds of four long graves could still be discerned in a flat area nearby where the cliffs were broken by a small valley formed by an intermittent stream.\n\n## Today  \nHedbury Quarry. The cannon in the middle of the photo may have come from the wreck of the Halsewell  \nThe wreck lies between two steep hills named East and West Man, midway between the landing places of Seacombe and Winspit (formerly Windspit).  \nIn 1967 three divers from Swanage located one of the ship's cannons, as well as coins, cannonballs, lead shot, tackle and glass.2010  \nSome relics from the wreck are held by the Dorchester museum.  \nThe Worth Matravers church has a mirror from the ship hanging above the main door.  \nThe United Kingdom's Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Nautical Archaeology Society have been jointly piloting an \"Adopt-A-Wreck\" plan using the wreck of the Halsewell.Work with other organisations - MCA\n\nQuestion: Both images depict scenes related to the tragic shipwreck of the East Indiaman Halsewell.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nContext:\n# Shadwell forgeries  \nThe Shadwell forgeries, also known as the Shadwell Dock forgeries, the Shadwell Shams, or the Billy and Charley forgeries, were a series of mid-19th-century forgeries of medieval lead and lead-alloy artefacts. The latter name derives from the two Londoners, William \"Billy\" Smith and Charles \"Charley\" Eaton, who were responsible for their large-scale manufacture between 1857 and 1870. At the time, some antiquarians were fooled by the forgeries, despite them being crudely made by two individuals with limited skill in metalworking and little knowledge of medieval art.  \nToday, Billy and Charleys are viewed as examples of na\u00efve art or outsider art. A number of museums hold collections of them and they are sought-after collectible items in their own right. They have been sold for prices equalling or exceeding the values of examples of the medieval originals they purported to be.  Because of this, modern fake Billy and Charleys are  reportedly in circulation.  \n## William Smith and Charles Eaton  \nLittle is known of the lives of William Smith (dates unknown) and Charles Eaton (c.1834\u20131870) except that when young they were mudlarks \u2013 individuals that made a small living by searching the mudflats of the River Thames at low-tide, seeking any item of value. They lived in Rosemary Lane (now called Royal Mint Street) in what is now part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.  \nIn 1844 or 1845, Smith came into contact with an antique dealer, William Edwards; Eaton met Edwards some years later. Edwards came to view the pair as \"his boys\" and frequently bought from them items of interest they found while mudlarking. In 1857, the two began to manufacture counterfeit artefacts to sell to Edwards.  \n## Forgeries  \n<ImageHere>A Billy and Charley lead plaque. in Auckland War Memorial Museum, accession number 1932.427\n\n<ImageHere>A lead Billy and Charley medallion, in in diameter, in thick and weighing oz. One side shows the profile head of a man wearing a crown; the other shows the head of a helmeted knight. The medallion is dated \"1030\". United Kingdom Portable Antiquities Scheme\nDuring their career, Smith and Eaton are estimated to have made between 5,000 and 10,000 items of many kinds, including pilgrim badges, ampulla, statuettes, portable shrines, coins, medallions and ornamental spearheads. Initially they were all made from lead or pewter, but later the two also used a copper-lead alloy. The items were cast using plaster of Paris moulds, into which a design was engraved by hand. They were then given the appearance of age by being bathed in acid and coated with river mud.  \nThe most common type of Billy and Charley were medallions, around 0 in diameter. These had crude depictions of knights in armour, crowned kings or religious figures. They often carried inscriptions, but as Smith and Eaton were illiterate, these were meaningless. To give the appearance of age, many of the items also carried dates between the 11th century and the 16th century. However the dates were inscribed using Arabic numerals which only came into use in England during the 15th century and so are anachronistic on the \"older\" items.  \nSmith and Eaton sold their forgeries to Edwards, selling around 1100 items between 1857 and 1858 for a total of \u00a3200. The two claimed the source of the steady stream of antiquities was the large-scale excavations then taking place as part of the construction of London's Shadwell Dock. In June 1857, Edwards showed samples to another antique dealer, George Eastwood. Eastwood bought the 1100 items from Edwards, before bypassing him and buying further supplies directly from Smith and Eaton.  \nEastwood advertised them as a \"A remarkable curious and unique collection of leaden signs or badges of the time of Richard II\",. He sold them to several customers, including to one person buying them on behalf of the British Museum.\n\n## Libel trial  \n<ImageHere>A Billy and Charley in the form of a lead statuette, in high; probably intended to represent a bishop. Manchester Museum, accession number 1981.1150.\nBy 1858, Henry Syer Cuming, the secretary of the British Archaeological Association, together with the archaeologist Thomas Bateman, had noticed the appearance of large numbers of medieval artefacts for sale which they suspected to be forgeries from a single source. On 28 April, Cuming delivered a lecture, Some Recent Forgeries in Lead, to the British Archaeological Association in which he condemned them as \"Gross attempts at deception\".  \nThe lecture was reported in The Gentleman's Magazine and The Athenaeum. George Eastwood responded firstly with a letter defending the authenticity of the items he was selling, and then by suing the publishers of The Athenaeum for libel. He had not been named in the magazine's report but he was the only seller of the items so his complaint was that the Athaenum had libelled him implicitly and damaged his business.  \nThe trial was held at Guildford Assizes on 4 August 1858. The judge was Sir James Shaw Willes, Eastwood was represented by Edwin James QC. The Athenaeum was represented by Montague Chambers QC.  \nWilliam Smith (described in a newspaper report as a \"rough looking young man\") was one of the witnesses. In his testimony, Smith claimed he had obtained them from the Shadwell Dock construction site, by bribing the navvies building the dock with money and drink, and by sneaking onto the site himself after hours. He testified he had sold around 2000 items, making around \u00a3400. Examples of the artefacts were presented to the courts as exhibits; according to The Times newspaper report, \"a good deal of amusement was produced by the extraordinary nature of some of those that were produced.\"  \nCharles Roach Smith, a leading antiquarian and co-founder of the British Archaeological Association, testified to the authenticity of the Billy and Charleys. Before the trial, Roach-Smith had stated their very crudity was an argument for their authenticity \u2013 he assumed any 19th-century forger intent on deception would simply have done a better job in making them. Under examination during the trial, he stated his belief that they were a previously unknown class of object with an unknown purpose. However, he was confident of their age.  \nThe Rev. Thomas Hugo, vicar of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and a published author on the subject, gave testimony that supported Roach-Smith, stating that the items dated from the 15th or 16th centuries,  although under cross-examination he was unable to state exactly why he thought so. The artist and antiquary Frederick William Fairholt also testified that he believed them authentic, as did two other antique dealers.  \nThe Athenaeum had not named George Eastwood in its report so the trial judge directed the jury to find the magazine publishers not-guilty of libel, but it was asked to affirm its faith in Eastwood's integrity.\n\n## Subsequent history  \nThe libel trial attracted widespread publicity. Even though Eastwood failed to convict The Athenaeum of libel, the result gave the appearance of endorsing the authenticity of his stock, and his sales increased.  \nRoach-Smith reported on the trial in The Gentleman's Magazine, stating his theory the items were of 16th century origin. In 1861, he published volume five of his work, Collectanea antiqua. This included an article stating the items were crude, religious tokens, dating from the reign of Mary I of England, that had been imported from continental Europe as replacements for the devotional items destroyed during the English Reformation.  \nIronically, earlier volumes of the Collectanea antiqua had been among the scholarly reference works used by Smith and Eaton when creating their fakes.  \nMeanwhile, the businessman, politician and antiquarian Charles Reed had renewed the investigation of the artefacts; although he may have been prompted by Roach-Smith's book. He made inquiries in the Shadwell Dock construction site, but could not find anyone that had sold items to Smith or Eaton. He gained the confidence of a tosher (one who scavenges in sewers), who confirmed that Smith and Eaton had been selling forgeries. He was introduced to Smith and Eaton, and gained their trust, but paid the tosher to break into their workshop and steal several of their moulds; these were exhibited at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in March 1861 as proof the items were fakes.  \n## Later career of Smith and Eaton  \nDespite their exposure, Smith and Eaton continued to make and sell forgeries throughout the 1860s. They began using a lead-copper alloy known as cock metal and their work showed somewhat improved craftsmanship. But increasing awareness of their activities made it harder for them to sell their forgeries. In 1867 they were arrested in Windsor, Berkshire after a local clergyman recognised the items they were selling. In court, there was found to be insufficient evidence to prosecute and they were released.  \nCharley Eaton died in January 1870 of consumption. William Smith's last appearance in the historical record was in 1871, when he was attempting to sell a copy of a 13th-century lead jug. Nothing further is known of him.  \n## Collections  \nExamples of Billy and Charleys are in the collections of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Museum of London. Many are held by the Cuming Museum, which includes the personal collection of Henry Syer Cuming.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true about the artifacts depicted in the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

They represent Lakner's conceptual innovations and multitude of artistic methods, with which he continues to explore the world.  \n## Works in public collections  \n* Germany:  \n* * Museum Ludwig, Aachen  \n* * Nationalgalerie, Berlin  \n* * Berlinische Galerie, Berlin  \n* * Paula Modersohn-Becker Foundation, Bremen  \n* * Museum Folkwang, Essen  \n* * Art collection of the University of Freiburg im Breisgau  \n* * Museum Ludwig, K\u00f6ln  \n* * Von der Heydt-Museum, Wuppertal  \n* * Neues Museum Weserburg, Bremen, from 2010 Kunsthalle, Bremen  \n* Netherlands:  \n* * Museum Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam  \n* Poland:  \n* * Museum of modern art, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a  \n* Hungary:  \n* * Hungarian National Gallery,  Budapest  \n* * Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest  \n* * Ludwig-Museum, Budapest  \n* * Pet\u00f6fi-Literatur-Museum, Budapest  \n* * Kiscelli-Museum, Budapest  \n* * X\u00e1ntus J\u00e1nos Museum, Gy\u0151r  \n* * V\u00e1rosi M\u00fcv\u00e9szeti Museum, Gy\u0151r  \n* * Hatvany Lajos Museum, Hatvan  \n* * Janus Pannonius Museum, P\u00e9cs  \n* * Vasarely Museum, P\u00e9cs  \n* * Szent Istv\u00e1n Kir\u00e1ly Museum, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r  \n* * Szombathelyi K\u00e9ptar, Szombathely  \n* Great Britain:  \n* * Victoria and Albert Museum, London  \n* Italy:  \n* * Uffizi Gallery, Florenz  \n* Japan:  \n* * Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokio  \n## Exhibitions  \nSolo exhibitions (selection):  \n* 1969 KKI Galeria, Budapest  \n* 1974 Neue Galerie \u2013 Collection Ludwig, Aachen  \n* 1975 Overbeck-Gesellschaft, L\u00fcbeck  \n* 1975 Neuer Berliner Kunstverein und DAAD, Berlin  \n* 1975 Galerie Folker Skulima, Berlin  \n* 1976 Galerie Denise Ren\u00e9-Hans Mayer, D\u00fcsseldorf  \n* 1979 Westf\u00e4lischer Kunstverein, M\u00fcnster  \n* 1983 Galerie Bertha Urdang, New York  \n* 1987 Forum Kunst, Rottweil  \n* 1998 Stadsschouwburg Heerlen, Niederlande  \n* 2004 Zacheta Narodowa Galeria Sztuki (Nationalgalerie), Warschau  \n* 2004 Galeria Sztuki (Kunsthalle), Posen, Polen  \n* 2004 Ludwig-Museum, Budapest  \n* 2006 Augsburger Kunstverein  \n* 2006 Galerie Georg Nothelfer, Berlin  \n* 2007 Pet\u00f6fi Irodalmi Museum, Budapest  \n* 2011 Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest  \nParticipations in exhibitions:  \n* 1967 XV.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# List of municipalities in Prince Edward Island  \nA map of Canada, showing Prince Edward Island in red.  \n<ImageHere>Distribution of Prince Edward Island's 72 municipalities by municipal status type 2017\nPrince Edward Island is the least populous province in Canada with 154,331 residents as of the 2021 census and is the smallest in land area at abbr=on. Prince Edward Island's 63 municipalities cover 1 of the province's land mass and were home to 154331 of its population in 2021. These municipalities provide local government services to their residents in the form of fire protection, municipal planning services, and emergency measures planning. The remaining unincorporated areas have no local government.  \nMunicipal statuses in Prince Edward Island are cities, towns, rural municipalities, and resort municipalities. Under Prince Edward Island's Municipal Government Act (MGA), which came into force on December 23, 2017, the formation of a municipality can be proposed by the Minister of Fisheries and Communities, the council of an existing municipality, or a petition signed by 30% of the residents that would be the electors of the new municipality. To be eligible for city or town status, certain minimum estimated population and total property assessment value criteria must be met. If those criteria are not met, rural municipality status can be granted if it is the opinion of the Minister of Fisheries and Communities that it would be in the public interest. The province's lone resort municipality \u2013 the Resort Municipality of Stanley Bridge, Hope River, Bayview, Cavendish and North Rustico \u2013 was established by order in council in 1990. The 2017 Municipal Government Act prevents creation of any new resort municipalities.  \nPrince Edward Island has two cities, ten towns, fifty rural municipalities and one resort municipality, which are distributed across three counties \u2013 Kings, Prince and Queens. Charlottetown is Prince Edward Island's capital and largest municipality by population while Belfast is the largest municipality by land area. The smallest municipalities by population and land area are Tignish Shore and St. Louis respectively.\n\n## Cities  \n<ImageHere>Aerial view of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island's capital and largest city\n\n<ImageHere>Summerside, Prince Edward Island's second largest municipality and only other city\nUnder the province's Municipal Government Act, a municipality may incorporate as a city if it has an estimated population of 15,000 or more and a total property assessment value of $750 million or more. Should a city no longer meet these requirements, the Minister of Fisheries and Communities may recommend to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to change the status of the municipality to a more appropriate status.  \nPrince Edward Island has two cities. Charlottetown is Prince Edward Island's capital and largest city both by population with 38,809 residents and by land area with abbr=on. It forms the core of a census agglomeration that encompasses the middle of the island and is home to 78,858 residents, or 154331 of the island's population. The province's second city is Summerside, which is located on the west side of the island. It has a population of 16,001 and a land area of abbr=on. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables cities to elect a mayor and a minimum of eight councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022.\n\n## Towns  \nUnder the province's Municipal Government Act, a municipality may incorporate as a town if has an estimated population of 4,000 or more but is less than 15,000, and a total property assessment value of $200 million or more, but is less than $750 million. Should a town no longer meet these requirements, the Minister of Fisheries and Communities may recommend to the Lieutenant Governor in Council to change the status of the municipality to a more appropriate status.  \nPrince Edward Island has ten towns that are incorporated municipalities, which had a cumulative population of\u00a032,632 in the 2021 census. The province's largest and smallest towns are Stratford and North Rustico with populations of 10,927 and 648 respectively. Three Rivers is Prince Edward Island's largest town by land area with abbr=on and O'Leary is the province's smallest town by land area with abbr=on. Three Rivers is also the province's newest town, which incorporated as a town on September 28, 2018 through the amalgamation of the towns of Georgetown and Montague, five rural municipalities (Brudenell, Cardigan, Lorne Valley, Lower Montague, and Valleyfield), and portions of three adjacent unincorporated areas. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables towns to elect a mayor and a minimum of six councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022.  \n## Rural municipalities  \nUnder the province's Municipal Government Act, municipalities that previously held community status under the previous Municipalities Act, which originally came into force in 1983, were carried forward as rural municipalities. With the amalgamation of Brackley and Winsloe South on December 15, 2017, and then the Municipal Government Act coming into force eight days later on December 23, 2017, Prince Edward Island had 58 communities that became rural municipalities. On September 28, 2018, three amalgamations reduced the total amount of rural municipalities to 50. As of the 2021 census, the province's largest and smallest rural municipalities are West River and Tignish Shore with populations of 3,473 and 64 respectively. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables rural municipalities to elect a mayor and a minimum of six councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022.  \n## Resort municipalities  \nPrince Edward Island has one municipality holding resort municipality status. The Resort Municipality of Stanley Bridge, Hope River, Bayview, Cavendish and North Rustico was established as a resort municipality in 1990. The province's Municipal Government Act allows this resort municipality to continue yet prevents the establishment of additional resort municipalities in the future. Starting with the municipal elections in 2018, the Municipal Government Act enables  the province's lone resort municipality to elect a mayor and a minimum of six councillors. With general municipal elections occurring every four years, the next municipal election is scheduled for November 2022. If the population of the lone resort municipality reaches 2,000 electors, it may be incorporated as a different type of municipality pursuant to the Municipal Government Act.  \n## List of municipalities\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the municipalities of Prince Edward Island (PEI) is correct based on the provided images and text?\nChoice list: \nA.

The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming the devil appears when the sun shines through and turns the goat's eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak in the guise of her deceased son.  \nIrene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God and the emblem on Noiret's rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy's descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery then became the present-day boarding school.  \nAt the school, Irene and Debra face off against a fully possessed Maurice. Sophie shows the women the stained-glass goat in the chapel and they use a flashlight to make its eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature.  \nAs the goat attacks the students, Maurice attacks Irene, chases Sophie, and causes the bell tower to collapse. Debra admits to Irene that she now has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice, but he grabs it, causing Valak to appear. Similar to Father Noiret, Valak lifts Irene in the air and sets her ablaze. Irene does not burn as Valak realizes she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the same power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray, with faith, the Words of Institution used in Christian celebrations of the Eucharist and the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ, banishing the demon. With Valak gone, Irene and Debra managed to free Maurice of possession and save his life.  \nThe next morning, Irene leads Maurice outside and helps him to regain his senses. However, she becomes concerned as she watches him going with Sophie and Kate inside.\n\n## Cast  \n* Taissa Farmiga as Sister Irene Palmer  \n* * Margot Bernazzi as young Irene  \n* Jonas Bloquet as Maurice  \n* Storm Reid as Sister Debra  \n* Anna Popplewell as Kate  \n* Bonnie Aarons as The Demon Nun  \n* Katelyn Rose Downey as Sophie  \n* Suzanne Bertish as Madame Laurent  \n* L\u00e9ontine d'Oncieu as Simone  \n* Anouk Darwin Homewood as Celeste  \n* Maxime Elias-Menet as Jacques  \n* Pascal Aubert as Father Noiret  \n* David Horovitch as Cardinal Conroy  \n* Kate Colebrook as Irene's Mom / Saint Lucy  \n* Andrew Morgado provides the demonic voice  \nAdditionally, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively in the mid-credits scene, using archived footage from The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.  \n## Production  \n<ImageHere>Former Couvent des Pr\u00eacheurs monastery in Aix-en-Provence, the location of the boarding school in the film.\nArc de Boqui in Tarascon, one of the filming locations.\n<ImageHere>Chapelle des Ursulines d'Aix-en-Provence aka.

Safran stated that there was a \"really fun\" storyline planned for the film and commented that there was an \"inevitability to another The Nun movie\". Later that month, Akela Cooper signed onto the project as screenwriter while Safran and James Wan agreed to serve as producers.  \nIn February 2022, Taissa Farmiga stated that she had had discussions with Warner Bros. Pictures to reprise her role from the first film while stating that the restrictions on the film industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic had delayed the project. In April 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures officially announced the movie as a part of its upcoming slate at the 2022 CinemaCon. The following day, it was announced that Michael Chaves would direct the film.  \nIn September 2022, it was revealed that Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing had contributed as screenwriting co-authors of the most recent draft of the script.  \n### Casting  \nIn April 2022, James Wan confirmed that Bonnie Aarons would be reprising her role as Valak. In September 2022, Storm Reid was cast as a new lead. In October 2022, Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet were confirmed to be reprising their roles from the first film, with Anna Popplewell and Katelyn Rose Downey added to the cast later that month.  \n### Filming  \nPreliminary production photography began on April 29, 2022. Filming was originally scheduled to start on September 5, 2022. Principal photography began in France on October 6, 2022, and concluded later that year. Filming locations include the former Couvent des Pr\u00eacheurs d'Aix-en-Provence monastery in Aix-en-Provence and rue Proudhon in Tarascon.  \n## Release  \nThe Nun II was theatrically released in the United States on September 8, 2023, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema.  \n### Home media  \nThe Nun II was released on digital download on October 3, 2023, and is scheduled to be released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on November 14, 2023 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.  \n## Reception  \n### Box office  \n, The Nun II has grossed $85.9\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $179.8\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $265.7\u00a0million.  \nIn the United States, The Nun II was released alongside My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3, and was projected to gross $31\u201334 million from 3,728 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $13 million on its first day, including $3.1 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $32.6 million, topping the box office. In its second weekend the film made $14.5 million, dropping 55.4% and topping newcomer A Haunting in Venice ($14.3 million). The film made $8.6 million in its third weekend, topping the box office again whilst narrowly defeating another new release, The Expendables 4 ($8.4 million).  \n### Critical response  \naccess-date=September 14, 2023 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale (up from the first film's \"C\"), while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 64% overall positive score, with 47% saying they would definitely recommend the film.  \nFrank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The filmmaker does a fine job creating a suitably ominous atmosphere (the old-world European locations and Tristan Nyby's gloomy cinematography really help) and orchestrates the violent mayhem, much of it involving terrified little girls, with disturbing relish.\" The Timess Ed Potton gave the film 3/5 stars, saying it \"often flirts with ridiculousness\", but praised Chaves's direction, Farmiga and Downey's performances and the finale. CNN's Brian Lowry called the film \"a slick if familiar addition to the very fertile Conjuring universe that, by deftly expanding on the 2018 hit, appears destined to become another cinematic habit.\" Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \"In some respects an improvement on its predecessor, in others not, this is finally one more good-enough if unmemorable entry sure to extend the series' life in lucrative fashion.\"  \nBob Smithouser of Plugged In stated that \"The Nun II is one of the purest cinematic versions of palpable image over substance that I've seen in some time.\" Claire Shaffer of The New York Times said the film \"runs like haunted clockwork, shoving characters down dark alleyways or abandoned chapels every five minutes with little justification. Scene after scene builds fear and tension, and then a monster appears, and then \u2026 not much else, in most cases.\" The Sydney Morning Heralds Jake Wilson gave it 2/5 stars, writing, \"The shocks are brief and not too grisly, the dingy Gothic look is as you'd expect, and the mechanical climax steers clear of the more unsettling possibilities that might have emerged if Frenchie's Jekyll and Hyde sides had been meaningfully linked.\" Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press gave it 1/5 stars, writing, \"A new directing and writing team fails to shock or scare with a color-by-numbers plot and a meandering, languid wannabe frightfest.\"\n\nQuestion: In the story described, which location became the present-day boarding school where the final confrontation with the demon Valak takes place?\nChoice list: \nA.

Leo V is the only Byzantine emperor to be nicknamed \"Armenian\" by Byzantine chroniclers.\n\n<ImageHere>This now-destroyed mosaic of Gregory the Illuminator, Armenia's patron saint, in Hagia Sophia, Constantinople may had been created next to the Church Fathers in support of the myth of the Arsacid origin of Basil I, likely fabricated by Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople.\n\n<ImageHere>This 7th century obelisk in Oshakan, Armenia is attributed by a local tradition to emperor Maurice or his mother.\nAccording to medieval and modern sources, a number of Byzantine emperors were allegedly Armenian or of partially Armenian heritage. The following list includes the Byzantine emperors to whom sources attribute Armenian origin. Speculation of Armenian ancestry in emperors remains a wide topic of debate.\n\n## History and criticism  \nThe first work on Byzantine emperors of Armenian origin, Armenian Emperors of Byzantium (\u0540\u0561\u0575 \u056f\u0561\u0575\u057d\u0565\u0580\u0584 \u0532\u056b\u0582\u0566\u0561\u0576\u0564\u056b\u0578\u0576\u056b), was authored by Fr. Garabed Der-Sahagian and published in 1905 by the Mekhitarist congregation of San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice. Anthony Kaldellis suggested that Der-Sahagian extended \"western European modes of racial and nationalist historiography to the history of medieval Armenia.\" Kaldellis believes that it was Nicholas Adontz who \"made the search for Armenians in Byzantium into a more scholarly and less romantic nationalist process.\" However, he is critical of Adontz as he saw \"Armenians everywhere and injected them into as many important events as he could.\" According to Kaldellis it was later endorsed by Peter Charanis and Alexander Kazhdan and \"has spread widely in the field of Byzantine Studies.\" Kazhdan's book Armenians in the Ruling Class of the Byzantine Empire in the 11th-12th Centuries was published by the Armenian Academy of Sciences in Russian in 1975.  \nCharanis suggested that \"every emperor who sat on the Byzantine throne from the accession of Basil I to the death of Basil II (867\u20141025) was of Armenian or partially Armenian origin.\" However, he noted that \"in Byzantium the ethnic origins of a person was of not significance, provided he integrated himself into its cultural life.\" Robert H. Hewsen counted \"no fewer than sixteen emperors and eleven empresses\" of Byzantium of Armenian origin and suggested that Armenians ruled \"for almost a third of the empire's history.\" He conceded, however, that \"most of these Armenians, of course, were thoroughly hellenized, membership in the Greek Church being the sine qua non for advancement in the Byzantine world.\"  \nAnthony Kaldellis is highly critical of what he calls the \"Armenian fallacy\" in Byzantine studies to which he dedicated a separate chapter (Armenian fallacy) and a sub-chapter specifically about emperors (Armenian' emperors) in his 2019 book Romanland: Ethnicity and Empire in Byzantium, published by Harvard University Press. He wrote:  \nEven earlier, in 2008, Kaldellis wrote in a publication for Oxford University Press:  \nKaldellis' criticisms of the \"Armenian fallacy\" have been subsequently praised and supported by historians such as Johannes Preiser-Kapeller, Alexander Beihammer, Marek Klat\u00fd, and C.J.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Storage pest  \nA storage pest is an insect or other animal that damages or destroys stored food or other stored valuable organic matter. Insects are a large proportion of storage pests with each type of crop having specific insects that gravitate towards them such as the genus Tribolium that consists of insects such as Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) or Tribolium confusum (confused flour beetle) which damage flour crops primarily.  \n## Insects  \nCrops can be completely destroyed or even partially damaged affecting the quality of the crop and the ability to germinate new ones, by decreasing the protein content and removing the seeds from the grains.  \n### Types of insect pests  \n<ImageHere>Lesser grain borer\nThere are two types of grain insect pests, primary and secondary pests.\n\n#### Primary pests  \nPrimary grain pests attack the whole grain. The eggs are laid inside the grain, before the larvae mature inside the grain and then chew their way out. Some of these pests include the Lesser grain borer, Granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius, the Wheat weevil) and Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae).  \n##### Lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica) Lesser grain borer  \nThe lesser grain borer has a dark coloured cylindrical structure with the head concealed. When lesser grain borer eggs are laid, they are laid outside the grain, however they mature inside the shell of the seed which can take up to 6 weeks if the temperature is cooler, with the adult borers not living for longer than two months. This species is known to damage stored wheat, maize/corn and other cereal crops with the seeds becoming hollowed out husks. Products with small infestations should be discarded however the grains can be treated with smaller amounts of spray. However, large infestations require more control, including complete fumigation.  \n<ImageHere>Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae).\n\n\n##### Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae)  \nThe adult rice weevil has an orange-black exoskeleton and lays up to 450 eggs in pores of the damaged grains with each hatched egg further damaging the grain from the inside. Similarly to the lesser grain borer, maturation also happens inside the grain with the matured adult rice weevil eating through the husk of the grain to get out. The life cycle is similar to that of the lesser grain borer in summer months (approximately one month) and adult weevils live up to 8 months after the experience their life cycle.  \n<ImageHere>Rust-red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum).\n\n\n#### Secondary pests  \nSecondary grain insects feed on broken grain and any powder products left as a result of the broken grain. These pests include the genus Tribolium, beetle species and moth species.  \n##### Rust-red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) Rust-red flour beetleTribolium castaneum  \nThe Red flour beetle or Rust-red flour beetle is a red-brown beetle with an exoskeleton that darkens in colour as the beetle increases in age, with the maximum adult age being a year. Unlike primary pests, Rust-red flour beetles can produce up to 1000 eggs and lay them inside the damaged grain with parts of the larvae able to use the damaged grains and cereal as their food source.  \nWarehouse moth (Ephestia elutella).  \n##### Warehouse moth (Ephestia elutella) Ephestia elutella  \nThe Warehouse moth is a grey moth that remains on the surface of the grain with the female moth laying up to 200 eggs, however their life span is only 2 weeks long with a 4 week life cycle. Similarly to other secondary pests, the Warehouse moth eggs use the surface of the grain, although when the larvae hatch they leave a stream of silk that encapsulates the surface of the grain which can then be used as a cocoon for mature larvae.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following insects is known as a primary pest of stored grain products?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nContext:\n# Lu Xiaopeng  \nLu Xiaopeng (w=Lu Hsiao-p'eng; 19 August 1920 \u2013 16 October 2000) was a Chinese aircraft designer who spent most of his career at Hongdu Aviation (formerly Nanchang Aircraft). He was the chief designer of the Nanchang Q-5 supersonic attack aircraft, one of the most widely deployed aircraft of the PLA Air Force. He also designed the Nanchang J-12, the world's lightest supersonic fighter, which however never entered service. He was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.  \n## Early life and career  \nLu was born on 19 August 1920 in Shanghai, Republic of China, with his ancestral home in Changzhou, Jiangsu. He studied at the Jiangsu Provincial High School from 1935 to 1937, and then entered the National Central University to study aeronautical engineering. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the university was exiled in Chongqing, China's wartime capital, and he graduated in 1941.  \nIn 1942, he received further training at the Republic of China Air Force's mechanics school in Chengdu. A year later, he was assigned to work for the No. 2 Aircraft Manufacturing Factory in Nanchuan, Chongqing, as an aircraft designer. In December 1944, he was sent to the United States to work at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, where he participated in the design of shipborne jet fighters. He was then sent to Britain to work as a designer at the Gloster Aircraft Company.  \n## Early PRC and the Shenyang JJ-1  \n<ImageHere>A Shenyang JJ-1 jet trainer\nIn August 1949, just before the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Lu returned to China via Hong Kong to work for the new  government. From 1949 to 1951, Lu worked on constructing airports in the East China Military Region. After the Korean War broke out, Lu was transferred to Beijing Nanyuan Airport to service military and transport aircraft in support of the war effort.  \nIn 1956, he was transferred to the aircraft design office of Shenyang Aircraft Factory (112 Factory), working under director Xu Shunshou. He was one of the main designers of the Shenyang JJ-1 trainer, the first jet aircraft designed in China. Besides Xu Shushou and deputy director Huang Zhiqian, Lu was the only person in the development team who had had aircraft design experience. The project began in October 1956, and the plane took its maiden flight less than two years later, on 26 July 1958. The development cycle was less than half that of similar planes designed in Japan and Czechoslovakia and the performance was superior.\n\n## Designing the Nanchang Q-5 attack aircraft  \n<ImageHere>A Nanchang A-5 (Q-5) of the Bangladesh Air Force\nIn 1958, Lu was transferred to the Hongdu Aircraft Factory (320 Factory) in Nanchang, and appointed chief designer of the Nanchang Q-5  supersonic attack aircraft. However, because of economic difficulties during the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese government decided to cancel the project in August 1961. Lu petitioned the government to save the project, and was allowed to continue his research, but his staff was reduced from more than 100 members to just 14.  \nWith his skeleton crew, Lu spent two years to build a stationary prototype aircraft. This achievement caught the attention of Minister Sun Zhiyuan (\u5b59\u5fd7\u8fdc) of the Third Ministry of Machine Building and Cao Lihuai (\u66f9\u91cc\u6000), Deputy Commander of the PLA Air Force. They ordered a full resumption of the project, and the Q-5 completed its maiden flight on 4 June 1965. After further testing and improvement, the Q-5 was mass produced in 1968 to equip the Air Force. It was China's first self-designed attack aircraft that was mass produced and widely deployed. In January 1972, a modified Q-5 aircraft (Q5-A) was used to conduct a hydrogen bomb test at Lop Nur.  \nIn 1981, Lu was again named chief designer for updating the Q-5 with an improved range. The redesigned Q-5, with seven different models, became one of the most widely used aircraft in the Chinese Air Force. It was also exported to foreign countries. In 1985, the Q-5 project won the Special Prize of the State Science and Technology Progress Award.\n\n## Designing the Nanchang J-12 fighter  \n<ImageHere>A Nanchang J-12 on display at the Chinese Aviation Museum\nIn the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and Arab countries, the Soviet-made aircraft performed poorly, and the PLA Air Force wanted a new lightweight fighter to replace its Shenyang J-6, which was the Chinese-made version of the Soviet MiG 19. In 1969, Lu was tasked with designing the Nanchang J-12 supersonic fighter. Only 17 months later, the aircraft took its first flight on 26 December 1970. The J-12 was the first fighter jet completely designed with Chinese technology and not modelled after a Soviet aircraft. It was also the lightest supersonic fighter in the world, with exceptional dexterity and evasion ability. However, its light weight also proved to be a weakness, as the limited space for missiles and fuel and the lack of a radar meant it had poor range and combat capabilities. As a result, the J-12 never entered service, but it laid a solid foundation for the future development of fighters.\n\n## Other contributions and awards  \nIn addition to designing aircraft, Lu conducted theoretical research on aerodynamics. He wrote a textbook on aircraft design in 1974, and a 400,000-word research report on fourth-generation lightweight fighters. In 1991, he was awarded the Aviation Gold Medal, the highest award in China's aviation industry. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1995.  \nLu died on 16 October 2000, at the age of 80.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following aircraft was the first jet aircraft designed in China?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Solar power in Florida  \nSolar panels on parking lot roof, Miami  \nSolar power in Florida has been increasing, as the cost of solar power systems using photovoltaics (PV) has decreased in recent years.  \nFlorida has low electricity costs compared with other states, which makes individual solar investment less attractive.  \nFlorida ranks ninth nationally in solar resource strength according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and tenth in solar generation by the Solar Energy Industries Association.  \n## Government support  \nSolar panel installation, Broward County  \nIn 2006, the State of Florida enacted the Florida Renewable Energy Technologies and Energy Efficiency Act, which provided consumers with rebates and tax credits for solar photovoltaic systems.  \nThe program was closed in 2010.  \nLater, the Florida Public Service Commission mandated that the state's large utilities offer individual solar rebates.  \nThe program opened in 2011 and was closed in 2015 after the Commission deemed it to not be cost-effective for non-solar customers.  \nIn 2008, Florida adopted a net metering rule that allows any electric utility customer generating up to 2\u00a0MW (2,000\u00a0kW) of power to use net metering, which provides a retail rate credit for kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered to the utility, rolled over from month to month, and paid out in cash by the utility once a year at the avoided cost rate.  \n<ImageHere>Solar farm at Kennedy Space Center\nThe federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit (income tax credit on IRS Form 5695) for residential PV and solar thermal was extended in December 2015 to remain at 30% of system cost (parts and installation) for systems put into service by the end of 2019, then 26% until the end of 2020, and then 22% until the end of 2021. It applies to a taxpayer's principal and/or second residences, but not to a property that is rented out. There is no maximum cap on the credit, and the credit can be applied toward the Alternative Minimum Tax, and any excess credit (greater than that year's tax liability) can be rolled into the following year.\n\n## Large-scale facilities  \nDesoto Solar Plant  \nIn 2009, Florida Power & Light built the state's first solar power plant, the FPL DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center.  \nAt the time, the 25-MW plant was the largest of its kind.  \nIn 2010, FPL built the world's first hybrid solar-natural gas energy center.  \nThe state's largest solar plant is the 75\u00a0MW FPL Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center, in Martin County operated by Florida Power and Light.  \nIt was the world's first hybrid solar-natural gas energy center and is a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant using solar thermal instead of photovoltaic technology.  \nNo additional CSP plants are under development in Florida, although in 2007 a 300\u00a0MW Fresnel CSP plant had been planned.  \nThe state's largest photovoltaic plant was the 25\u00a0MW DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, operated by Florida Power and Light, completed in 2009. Florida Power and Light also operates the Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center, a 10 MW photovoltaic facility near the Kennedy Space Center.  \nThe 100\u00a0MW Sorrento Solar Farm was expected to become Florida's largest photovoltaic solar farm with 40\u00a0MW of photovoltaic capacity already under construction in Lake County. However the company Blue Chip Energy became insolvent and the equipment and farm site was sold at a public auction in 2013.  \nFlorida Power and Light announced in October 2014 that it would build three more power plants by the end of 2016. The FPL Manatee Solar Energy Center is located in Manatee County at a natural gas power plant, FPL Citris Solar Energy Center is in DeSoto County, near the FPL DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, and FPL Babcock Ranch Solar Energy Center is  in Charlotte County. The three plants together generate 225 MW, approximately the same as the total solar power installed in the entire state at the time.  \nTampa Electric Company is building a 2 MW farm at the Tampa International Airport. Gulf Power Company and the U.S. military announced contracts for the construction of 3 large plants in Florida: a 50 MW project at Saufley Field in Pensacola, a 40 MW project being at Holley Field in Navarre, and a 30 MW project at Eglin Air Force Base.  \nIn April 2015, Duke Energy Florida proposed to build 500MW of solar in the next ten years.  \nSet to go live on January 1, 2018, the 20-megawatt Tallahassee Solar Farm is still currently under construction on 120 acres of the property of Tallahassee International Airport (TLH). Even though it has reached capacity a second solar farm is being planned for the city.  \nDuke Energy and Walt Disney World built a five-megawatt solar farm near Epcot Center which has been called the Walt Disney World Solar Facility, or 'Hidden Mickey'. It is visible from the air as a giant Mickey Mouse shape. It sells power to Walt Disney World. Disney World will soon be adding a new solar farm ten times larger than the Hidden Mickey farm. Reedy Creek Improvement District and Origis Energy are in agreement to build the farm on the western edge of Disney's property. It will provide renewable solar power to the Reedy Creek Improvement District and to Disney World.  \nIn April 2018, a new Florida town just north of Fort Myers called Babcock Ranch, began attempting to become fully solar-powered. Florida Power and Light partnered with town founders to build a 75-megawatt solar-generating facility that's already running. The land was purchased in 2006 and more than 90% is being preserved for wildlife. The town's developers hope its success will keep the federal government from imposing high tariffs on solar energy, and keep the energy source in private hands. Babcock Ranch developer Syd Kitson has said that Florida has done a good job of embracing solar energy.  \nTampa Electric currently has a plan to build a 350-acre solar farm in rural Pasco County which is being challenged by neighbors who oppose the project for visual aesthetic reasons. A county ordinance has been proposed restricting where solar farms can be located in the future.  \n## Solar panels  \n<ImageHere>Medium installation on South Beach roof in 2012.\nDevelopers in Florida have announced the addition of solar panels on all new homes in several subdivisions.  \nIn 2013, it was discovered that Blue Chip Energy was selling fraudulent solar panels to hundreds of consumers throughout Florida.\n\n## Statistics  \n<ImageHere>Average solar insolation\n\n\n### Potential generation  \nSolar energy is the state's most abundant energy resource and estimates have placed the state's potential at 2,902 GW, which would produce about 5,274,479 GWh, an amount much larger than the state and countries's total electricity consumption of 231,210 GWh and 4,125,060 GWh in 2010. Florida is one of only two states with no potential for conventional wind power, the other being Mississippi, and will need to either import energy from other states during overcast days and at night, or provide adequate grid energy storage. Most of the potential is from photovoltaics, which provides no storage. The state has some potential for concentrated solar power, but the potential is estimated at 0.13\u00a0GW. Taller, 140\u00a0meter hub height wind turbines allow up to 153\u00a0GW of wind turbines in Florida.  \n### Installed capacity\n\nQuestion: Which image is associated with a fraudulent activity according to the provided descriptions?\nChoice list: \nA.

Her father, Auguste Jules Ars\u00e8ne, was employed by the railway. As a student at the Conservatoire de Paris, she received a third medal for solf\u00e8ge in 1885, a first prize for op\u00e9ra comique in 1886, a second singing prize in 1887 and a second prize for op\u00e9ra comique in 1887.  \n<ImageHere>Mathide Auguez as Isabelle in the opera comique Turlupin (album from the Nadar workshop. Vol. 31)\n\n\n### Career  \nHer stage debut was in 1887 at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Her first important role, on 29 March 1888, was at that theatre in Madame Turlupin, an op\u00e9ra comique by Ernest Guiraud, in which she played Isabelle. She then sang in le Baiser de Suzon by Herman Bemberg (premiere, role of Suzon); in Gounod's Mireille and Maillard's Les dragons de Villars. On 30 January 1889, she premiered Louis Varney's la V\u00e9nus d'Arles at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nouveaut\u00e9s. On 11 December 1891, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, she was Denise de Flavigny in Herv\u00e9's Mam'zelle Nitouche. Later at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, she played in Offenbach's les Brigands.  \nIn 1894, she gave a song recital at la Bodini\u00e8re, which earned her this comment in la Caricature:  \nHer performances were frequently acclaimed by critics. For example, the Journal amusant wrote in 1910:  \nOn 10 March 1898, she married journalist and playwright Henri Lavedan.  \nAuguez died on 18 July 1955 at her home in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. She is buried with her husband and their daughter Genevi\u00e8ve at P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery.  \n<ImageHere>Mathilde Auguez and Albert Piccaluga in la V\u00e9nus d'Arles, Nadar workshop.\n\n\n\nQuestion: Which role did Mathilde Auguez portray in the opera comique \"Turlupin\" as shown in the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

Standing from left: Colonel Jan G\u0142ogowski, director Skowro\u0144ski, Zenon Przesmycki, Wac\u0142aw Berent, Piotr Choynowski, Juliusz Kleiner, Wincenty Rzymowski, Jerzy Szaniawski, Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, Karol Irzykowski, Tadeusz \u017bele\u0144ski, Tadeusz Zieli\u0144ski, and Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian\n\n<ImageHere>Diploma of the Polish Academy of Literature Golden laurel awarded to Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski in 1935\nThe Polish Academy of Literature (Polska Akademia Literatury, PAL) was one of the most important state institutions of literary life in the Second Polish Republic, operating between 1933 and 1939 with the headquarters in Warsaw. It was founded by the decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic (Rada Ministr\u00f3w RP).  \nThe academy was the highest opinion-forming authority in the country, in charge of all aspects of promoting and honoring the most outstanding contemporary achievements of Polish literature. According to its own statute, the main objective of the academy was to raise the quality level of Poland's publishing, while working in conjunction with the government efforts and NGO endeavors focused on the advancement of Polish culture and art in general. The century of foreign Partitions of Poland, ending in 1918, was marked by the forcible suppression of Polish education, language and religion under Prussian (and later German rule, see Kulturkampf), and outright Russification in the territories occupied by the Tsarist Empire, reaching its epitome under Otto von Bismarck on the one hand, and Nicholas II on the other. It resulted in staggering levels of illiteracy on Polish lands, as noted by Stefan \u017beromski in 1923. PAL was called forth to reinforce the historic standards of quality, exalt the honor of Poland's literary tradition and explore the intricacies of her heritage. It was proposed for the first time by \u017beromski in 1920 already, but accepted as an idea only nine years later (and five years after his death), in 1929.\n\n## Organization and the awards for contributions to literature  \nThe structure of the academy was modeled on the corresponding French Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. It consisted of 15 members chosen for life, seven of whom were selected by the Minister of Religion and Public Education. The remaining eight were proposed by the members of the first group. Notably, socialist writer and Freemason, Andrzej Strug declined the offer, upset by voices of official criticism of the movement.  \nThe academy awarded two highest national honors for contribution to the development of Polish literature: the Gold and the Silver Laurel (Z\u0142oty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn). Another prize, also widely regarded, was the Young Writer's Award, a door-opener for new and emerging talent. The honorary members included also the academy's main promoters: President of Poland Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki and Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski.  \nAmong the members of the academy were the luminaries of Poland's literary life including its own president Wac\u0142aw Sieroszewski, vicepresident Leopold Staff, secretary general Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, and popular writers such as Wac\u0142aw Berent, Piotr Choynowski, Zofia Na\u0142kowska, Zenon Przesmycki, Karol Irzykowski, Juliusz Kleiner, Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian, Karol Hubert Rostworowski, Wincenty Rzymowski, Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski, Jerzy Szaniawski, and Tadeusz Zieli\u0144ski.  \nThe composition changed after the death Choynowski (1935) and Le\u015bmian (1937) and after the withdrawal from PAL by Rzymowski accused of plagiarism (1937), and by Rostworowski (1937) protesting against the change of government. The new members were soon appointed, including writers Ferdynand Goetel, Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski, Jan Lorentowicz, and Kazimierz Wierzy\u0144ski. The academy ceased to exist following the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.  \n### Epilogue  \nIn 1947 following World War II, in the Soviet-controlled Polish People's Republic, there was a discussion among some communist writers about whether to reinstate the academy. The leading proponent of Polish Stalinism from Ku\u017anica, Jan Kott, summarized the subject in the following way: \"The Academy is like the monarchy; if it has existed for some time, one can get used to it, just as one can get accustomed to progressive bulbar palsy.

The gates use facial recognition technology to verify the traveller's identity against the data stored in the chip in their biometric passport, as well as run the data against numerous databases to determine if the traveller is a security risk.\n\n## Eligibility  \nBritish citizens, European Union, European Economic Area and Swiss citizens who are aged 10 or over and holding biometric passports are eligible to use the ePassport gates. ePassport gates are usually marked with this symbol (20px). The ePassport gates do not, however, accept national identity cards. If the holder's nationality is shown as a British overseas territories citizen; a British overseas citizen; a British subject; a British national (overseas); or a British protected person then the holder will not be able to use the ePassport gates.  \ncitizens of the following countries holding valid biometric passports became eligible to use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult:  \nUpon successfully using the ePassport gates, citizens of the above countries entering as a visitor are granted 6 months' leave to enter (subject to conditions prohibiting employment and recourse to public funds) and do not receive a passport stamp or any written notice/endorsement. However, citizens of the above countries who wish to enter the UK with a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker - Creative and Sporting) Certificate of Sponsorship (for up to 3 months) or on a permitted paid engagement are not eligible to use the ePassport gates, as a passport stamp must be obtained in these situations.  \nIn addition, citizens from the following countries/territories who are enrolled in the Registered Traveller Service can also use ePassport gates, provided that they hold valid biometric passports and are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult:  \nUpon successfully using the ePassport gates, citizens of the above countries who are enrolled in the 'Registered Traveller Service' and entering as a visitor are granted 6 months' leave to enter (subject to conditions prohibiting employment and recourse to public funds) without receiving a passport stamp or any written notice/endorsement.  \nPractical difficulties may be faced by non-British/EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who have used an ePassport gate to enter the UK as they do not receive a passport stamp evidencing leave to enter. For example, landlords are legally required to check the immigration status of tenants before the start of a tenancy agreement. The Home Office advises that where a prospective tenant is a non-visa national who used an ePassport gate to enter the UK, the landlord should accept any documentary evidence (such as a ticket or boarding pass) that establishes the date of arrival in the UK within the past 6 months.  \n## Use  \nTo use the ePassport gates, the traveller must have a biometric passport from the United Kingdom and certain other countries (these ePassports have the biometric logo on the front cover). The ePassport gate scanner reads all the information contained in the chip inside the passport, while a camera takes a picture of the traveller which is then compared against their passport photo using a facial recognition algorithm. Once the data verification and facial recognition process is complete, doors will automatically either open, signifying that the traveller is permitted to enter the country, or remain closed and a stop icon illuminate, demonstrating that the traveller has failed the security checks and will personally meet with immigration officials.  \n## Availability  \nAt present, ePassport gates are available at the following locations:  \n* Birmingham Airport  \n* Bristol Airport  \n* Cardiff Airport  \n* East Midlands Airport  \n* Edinburgh Airport  \n* Eurostar Brussels-South Terminal (juxtaposed controls)  \n* Eurostar Paris Nord Terminal (juxtaposed controls)  \n* Gatwick Airport (both terminals)  \n* Glasgow Airport  \n* Heathrow Airport (all terminals)  \n* London City Airport  \n* Luton Airport  \n* Manchester Airport (all terminals)  \n* Newcastle Airport  \n* Stansted Airport  \n## Suspension  \nAt some airports, the UK Border Force temporarily suspends the operation of ePassport gates when certain flights that are deemed to be 'high risk' arrive. For example, at Glasgow Airport, the UK Border Force has on occasions disabled the operation of ePassport gates when flights arrive from Romania, as it regards those flights to be 'high risk' from a safeguarding perspective. By requiring all arriving passengers to use a staffed immigration counter, UK Border Force officers are better able to identify potential victims of trafficking and modern slavery.  \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, ePassport gates were for a time suspended for all nationalities, including for all British nationals.\n\nQuestion: Which airport features ePassport gates that are located in the South Terminal?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\n<ImageHere>A view of the tower from the south east, published in 1889.\n\n\n### Exterior  \n<ImageHere>The tower's east elevation.\nThe external footprint of the tower is rectangular, roughly 0 by 0, and it is about 0 high. Stone water spouts project from the roof, cannon-shaped to the east frontage, and U-shaped on the other sides. Within the parapet, which is crenellated and supported by chequered corbels, there is a garret, and in the south east corner is a cap-house: a small attic covering the stairway and opening onto the wall walk.  \nThe chamfered windows are small and irregularly placed,2020 and corniced on the upper floors; their projecting lintels, unusual in Scotland, seem to have been intended to cast off rain. In the west and east faces, the ground floor walls are pierced by gunloops, shaped like inverted keyholes, in a style similar to that of Cardoness. The main entrance, on the ground floor of the north wall, has a broad segmental arch, and was formerly a doorway into a (now demolished) 17th-century extension; the less elaborate original entrance remains, in the centre of the east front. Above it is a worn heraldic plaque with two shields: the upper one, supported by a pair of unicorns, bears the Royal Arms of Scotland, while the lower shield shows a quartered coat of arms, probably for Gordon and Carson, although only a G is still discernible.  \nOn the north side of the building, the lower sections of the west and north walls of a 17th-century extension survive. This was already dilapidated by the 19th century, and most of it has since been demolished.\n\n### Interior  \nThe tower is noted for its unusual sophistication in the arrangement of small rooms built into the thickness of its walls,2020 which are up to 1 thick in places. Also built into the thickness of the walls is a turnpike stair with a newel, which ascends the full height of the tower.2020 The ground floor, which has an entresol level, is vaulted, and is divided into a number of store rooms and guard rooms, some with gun loops, and one with a trap door dropping down to a windowless dungeon. The entresol is tunnel vaulted, and occupied by a single room with windows in the south and east walls. It is likely that the ground floor was originally used to accommodate horses or cattle, with the entresol providing a sleeping place for servants.  \nTaking up most of the first floor is the great hall, 1 by 1 in size, with a beamed ceiling supported by corbels projecting from the walls, and arched windows. One of the stone seats in the west window serves as a step up to a concealed door. This gives access to a small room, again built into the thickness of the wall, which has an external window and also a laird's lug (Scots language for lord's ear): a small listening hole into the hall.  \nThe second floor and the attic, which would each originally have been occupied by single large rooms, have been subdivided.  \n## History  \n<ImageHere>19th-century plans and sections of the tower, still showing the 17th-century extension\n\n\n### Construction  \nThe tower was built between 1494 and 1504 for Mariota Carson (or Acarsane) and her husband, Robert Gordon, within the Glenskyreburn estate that had been gifted to them by her father, John Carson. Gordon, heir to the Lochinvar estate, took on the designation \"of Rusco\" after its completion, and is sometimes referred to by his wife's surname in records. He was brought before the Lords of Council in 1501 or 1502, charged with the destruction of a house on Crown lands within the barony of Kirkandrews in order to remove timber and slates, possibly to be used for the construction of Rusco Tower; he claimed that the house belonged to him, but was unable to prove it, and was ordered to pay 1,000 merks in damages.  \n### 16th century  \nGordon was forced to leave Rusco soon after it had been constructed. With his brother Alexander, he was implicated in the murder of John Dunbar of Mochrum around 1503, and  \nwhile his brother fled the country, Gordon was put to the horn, a form of punishment similar to outlawry, and his possessions were confiscated; his estate was let by the crown to a neighbour. In 1507, while still under the horn, Gordon was given permission to travel to France, and in 1511 he was given a pardon for his part in the crime, and allowed to return to Scotland and take up his estate once more. By 1516, he had been knighted.  \nRusco Tower was used to incarcerate a number of people in the 16th century. Gordon seized and imprisoned Janet Porter, an heiress who had recently married John McCulloch, a lesser member of the Cardoness McCulloch family. Gordon attempted to force her to sign over her inheritance, the Blacket estate, to him instead of her new husband, and McCulloch, who was not powerful enough to recapture his wife by force, applied to the courts. Gordon did not appear at the hearing, but in his absence the court ordered him to return Porter to her husband. It is not clear whether the order was obeyed, but records show that the Gordon family came to own the Blacket estate shortly afterwards.  \nGordon spent several years in litigation with the Agnews of Lochnaw, who were related to him by marriage. In 1523 he sought to bring the legal dispute to an end by abducting Andrew Agnew, the heir of Lochnaw and his own grandson, and imprisoning him at Rusco. When the boy's uncle, Matthew Agnew, demanded that he be returned within three days, Gordon claimed that he had been placed in a school in Dumfries. The records do not show how this affair was concluded.  \nRobert Gordon died in 1524, and within a year his wife Mariota Carson married Thomas Maclellan of Bombie. Since she owned Rusco Tower and its lands in her own right following the death of her husband, there would have been nothing to prevent her from leaving them to her new husband's family upon her death; her eldest son, James Gordon of Lochinvar, was so concerned that this might happen that he seized Rusco, where his mother was still living, and had her transported to the Borders and imprisoned. Her husband appealed to the courts, but before the case was concluded Maclellan was killed, in broad daylight, by Gordon and his retinue on the High Street in Edinburgh.  \n### Later history  \nThe later history of the tower was less turbulent. It was of minor importance to the Gordons once they had taken possession of Lochinvar, and was mostly used as accommodation for minor family members. It was sold in the 17th century, around which time a two-storey extension was added to the north side.2020 It was described in the poem \"Rusco Castle, a Tale of the Olden Time\" published in 1841 by Dugald Williamson of Tongland.  \nThe tower was lived in until the late 19th or early 20th century, but was abandoned and allowed to fall into ruin between the First and Second World Wars.  \nIn 1971, Rusco Tower was designated a Category A listed building.2020 The following year, it was purchased by Graham Carson, a Scottish businessman, who employed the architect W. Murray Jack to restore it to an inhabitable condition. The work was completed in 1979, and Carson moved into the tower with his family. Carson had a great-grandfather who was born in Wigtonshire, close to Rusco, and he attempted to find any connection between his family and the Carsons who had originally built the tower, but was never able to do so.2012 He lived in the tower until 2006, when he moved out and his son, Ian, took up residence;2012 as of 2018, Ian Carson was still living at Rusco Tower.2018\n\nQuestion: Which feature is common to the tower as depicted in the 19th-century illustration, the current photograph of the east elevation, and the 19th-century plans and sections?\nChoice list: \nA.

However, by early October, with the fall of the city seemingly inevitable, most of the RNAS unit was evacuated. On 8 October Grey and Marix took off in two Sopwith Tabloids which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks to attempt another raid. (Contemporary despatches and accounts state that Flight Lieutenant Sydney Vincent Sippe also took part in the raid, but was forced down before reaching German territory by a mechanical failure.) Grey arrived over Cologne to find it obscured by mist, and was again unable to find his target, so dropped his two bombs on the railway station. Marix had more luck, finding his target at D\u00fcsseldorf and dived from 3,000 to 500 feet before releasing his bombs, in the face of heavy rifle and machine fire from the ground. As he pulled away a fireball 500 feet high erupted from the shed, which contained the fully inflated airship LZ 25. Marix's aircraft sustained some damage from anti-aircraft fire, but he managed to fly to within 20 miles of Antwerp before having to land, and travelled by train and a borrowed bicycle to the aerodrome, which he found deserted apart from Grey, Sippe, and a party of Royal Marines. They promptly left the city by truck. Antwerp fell to the Germans the following day. Marix subsequently received a mention in despatches, and on 21 October, Grey, Marix and Collett were awarded the Distinguished Service Order. On 31 October Marix was promoted to flight commander.  \nIn late 1914 Marix was flying reconnaissance near Ypres, but a mechanical fault forced him to land. He walked to the British lines and returned to his aircraft with a party of four Marines, only to find five German Uhlans inspecting his aircraft. The Marines opened fire, and four Germans promptly mounted their horses and fled. The fifth Uhlan's horse was wounded, so he ran off, pursued by Marix, who eventually took him prisoner at gunpoint. The two men returned to the aircraft where Marix courteously lent his captive a revolver to administer the coup de gr\u00e2ce to his suffering mount, before taking him back to the British lines.\n<ImageHere>Flight Commander Marix and his Farman MF.11 aircraft at Tenedos, Gallipoli, 1915.\nMarix served in the Gallipoli Campaign during through most of 1915, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions. On 17 May Marix spotted unusual activity at the small port of Ak Bashi Liman. With Samson as his observer he returned that afternoon, flying a Breguet aircraft armed with one adj=on and fourteen adj=on bombs. Marix attacked the port, stopping work there for two days. A further reconnaissance flight led the British to conclude that the Turks were preparing an attack on Anzac Cove, and as a result their assault of 19 May was effectively repulsed with great loss of life. Marix later received a mention in despatches from the Vice-Admiral Commanding the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron.  \nMarix was promoted to squadron commander on 1 January 1916, and in February formed a new squadron of Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutters based at RNAS Detling, with the intention of mounting bombing raids on factories in the Essen and D\u00fcsseldorf areas, though it proved that the aircraft lacked the range to make these attacks successfully. However, in May 1916, a new Anglo-French strategic bombing force was created, under the command of Wing Captain William Leslie Elder, of which Marix's squadron formed the nucleus. Designated No. 3 Wing RNAS, the British aircraft were based at Luxeuil-les-Bains, close to France's eastern frontier, and comprised Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutters and Breguet Bre.5 bombers. The first raid was mounted on 30 July when a mixed force of nine French and British aircraft attacked M\u00fclheim. In September Marix and another pilot stopped at Paris while ferrying two Strutters to Luxeuil. They were invited to test fly a Nieuport, but Marix's aircraft broke up in mid-air, and he was seriously injured, having his left leg amputated, thus bringing his combat flying career to an abrupt end. Marix recovered from his accident, returning to serve as a staff officer. In August 1917 he was made a Chevalier of the Order of the Crown by the King of the Belgians. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and Marix transferred into the new service.\n\n## Inter-war career  \nMarix remained with the RAF post-war and on 1 August 1919 was awarded a permanent commission with the rank of major (later squadron leader). On 12 November he was appointed a temporary Staff Officer (2nd class) at the Air Ministry, and went on to serve as a member of the Inter-Allied Aeronautical Committee of Control (Germany) from 16 June 1920, and then as Officer Commanding, Motor Transport Repair Depot from 25 October 1921, until 11 April 1922. On 11 July 1922 he was awarded the Croix de Guerre avec palme by the King of the Belgians for his \"valuable services rendered in connection with the war\". From 25 September 1922 Marix served at the RAF Electrical and Wireless School, then on 15 January 1924 was posted to the Air Ministry, to serve on the Staff of the Directorate of Operations and Intelligence until 13 October 1924. He was placed on half-pay from 25 February to 16 September 1925, and on 24 September he was posted to the Air Staff of RAF Mediterranean. On 8 October 1928, he was transferred to the Department of the Chief of the Air Staff in the Directorate of Organisation and Staff Duties, serving there until 11 July 1932, and also receiving promotion to wing commander on 1 July 1930.  \nOn 12 September 1932 Marix was posted to Malta where he served as Officer Commanding of the RAF Base at Kalafrana, home of No. 202 (Flying Boat) Squadron, until taking command of RAF Hal Far on 16 April 1934. In June 1934 he was awarded an Interpretership (2nd class) in French from the RAF Staff College. Marix was promoted to group captain on 1 January 1936, and on 27 April returned to command at Kalafrana, remaining there until 9 November.  \nMarix then returned to England, where on 1 February 1937 he was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer, in the Headquarters of No. 16 (Reconnaissance) Group, based at Lee-on-Solent. He was appointed Officer Commanding No. 16 Group on 14 March 1939 and, following the granting of the acting rank (unpaid) of air commodore on 23 August, Air Officer Commanding.  \n## Second World War  \nOn 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Marix was granted the acting rank of air vice marshal. He was promoted to the temporary rank of air commodore (acting air vice-marshal) on 1 January 1940, and a week later was appointed Deputy Senior Air Staff Officer of Coastal Command. On 11 July 1940 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath \"in recognition of distinguished services rendered in recent operations\". On 24 March 1941 he became Air Officer Commanding, No. 18 (Reconnaissance) Group. On 10 February 1942 Marix relinquished his acting rank of air vice marshal, and on 10 March became Air Officer-in-charge of Administration of Ferry Command, which took over the ferrying of new aircraft from factories in North America to the UK from the civilian Atlantic Ferry Organisation. On 11 June 1942 Marix received his third mention in despatches, and on 1 October 1942 his temporary rank of air commodore was made substantive.  \n<ImageHere>Aircraft at Dorval Airport awaiting delivery to the UK via the North Atlantic route.\nOn 25 March 1943 Ferry Command was redesignated No. 45 (Atlantic Ferry) Group within the newly created Transport Command. On 1 April Marix was appointed Air Officer Commanding, No. 45 Group, and granted the acting rank of air vice-marshal for the second time on 11 April, which was made temporary on 1 June. On 12 June he was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta (2nd class) by the President of the Republic of Poland. As AOC, No. 45 Group, Marix was based at Dorval Airport, Montr\u00e9al, Canada. The Group comprised two ferrying wings, No. 112 (North Atlantic) Wing and No. 113 (South Atlantic) Wing, a Training Wing and a Communications Squadron, in all employing over 5,000 service and civilian personnel. On 4 January 1945 Marix arrived in Australia on an inspection tour of a new trans-Pacific ferry route from Canada to Australia, run by No. 45 Group in collaboration with the American Air Transport Command, in anticipation of increased activity in the South West Pacific theatre. He commanded No. 45 Group until replaced by Air Vice Marshal George Beamish on 15 June 1945. Marix then served at the Headquarters of Transport Command, until retiring from the RAF on medical grounds on 6 December 1945, retaining the rank of air vice marshal.  \nAir Vice Marshal Marix died on 7 January 1966. In May 2016 his medals, logbook and service revolver were donated to the RAF Museum by his 91-year-old daughter-in-law Yvelene de Marcellus Marix in Washington D.C.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows the aircraft that Flight Commander Marix used during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 for reconnaissance and bombing missions?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nA girl in Udaipur playing \"Jungle Child\"\nGirls' toys and games are toys and games specifically targeted at girls by the toy industry. They may be traditionally associated either exclusively or primarily with girls by adults and used by girls as an expression of identity. One commentator have argued that the market for girl's toys and games is more challenging than that for boys' toys and games.\n\n## Background  \nGames and toys, or types of play, in many cultures are gender (and age) neutral, but some are given a gender role (masculine or feminine). Games given a gender role are exclusive or segregationist, and a game labelled as such is often considered by both children and adults as appropriate for boys or girls but not both. Members of a culture that designated a game's gender role, as well as outsiders, may have difficulty discerning why it has that gender role. Some games, such as many sports, are or were officially gender segregated, and the gender role given a toy or game may affect its marketing.  \n## Age compression  \nGirls assembling a puzzle  \nAge compression is the modern trend of children moving through play stages faster than they did in the past. Children have a desire to progress to more complex toys at a faster pace, girls in particular. Barbie dolls, for example, were once marketed to girls around 8 years old but have been found to be more popular in recent years with girls around 3 years old. The packaging for the dolls labels them appropriate for ages 3 and up. Boys, in contrast, apparently enjoy toys and games over a longer timespan, gravitating towards toys that meet their interest in assembling and disassembling mechanical toys, and toys that \"move fast and things that fight\". An industry executive points out that girls have entered the \"tween\" phase by the time they are 8 years old and want non-traditional toys, whereas boys have been maintaining an interest in traditional toys until they are 12 years old, meaning the traditional toy industry holds onto their boy customers for 50% longer than their girl customers.  \nGirls gravitate towards \"music, clothes, make-up, television talent shows and celebrities\". As young children are more exposed to and drawn to music intended for older children and teens, companies are having to rethink how they develop and market their products to them.  Girls also demonstrate a longer loyalty to characters in toys and games marketed towards them. A variety of global toy companies have marketed themselves to this aspect of girls' development, for example, the Hello Kitty brand, and the Disney Princess franchise. Boys have shown an interest in computer games at an ever-younger age in recent years.date=April 2021  \n## Pink phenomenon  \nRows of pink girls' toys in a Canadian store, 2011  \n<ImageHere>Girls in Barbie Fashion Show in Children's Museum of Indianapolis\nIn Western countries in recent years, girls' toys and games have shifted towards a dominant use of the colour pink. Those shopping for girls' toys can easily spot the girls' toy section in a store because of the rows of aisles almost entirely stacked with bright pink products. There has been a backlash against the predominant use of pink in girls' toys. One British parent launched a campaign called Pinkstinks against retailers marketing educational toys to girls in pink. The almost exclusive use of pink for girls' toys has raised concern that it is polarizing gender identity from an early age, to the detriment of girls, by over-emphasizing beauty and passivity over fun and creativity.  \nThe reasons why girls may as a group prefer pink are not clear. Theories are divided between the nature versus nurture question. Social conditioning is one possible factor, since girls are surrounded by pink accessories and clothing from birth in some cultures. However, it has been proposed that a preference for pink is \"hard-wired\". One recent study showed \"a marked preference for pink among girls and women in different cultures\". Ben Goldacre has noted that it is likely to be cultural given that less than a hundred years ago pink was deemed the most appropriate colour for boys.  \nAmplifying gender identity differences between boys and girls is to the benefit of toy sellers. Targeted marketing has for many decades used the technique of categorizing children into segments for marketing purposes, much as the industry does with adults. Childhood age segments that are popularly believed to be identified by psychologists were in fact invented by children's clothing and toy manufacturers. Peggy Orenstein has drawn attention to research by Daniel Cook (a \"historian of childhood consumerism\"), that reveals the marketing origins of the age group known as \"toddler\":\n\n## Tween marketing  \nGirls playing in a park in the Netherlands  \nSimilarly, the age group known as tweens was a marketing invention dating to the mid-1980s to describe children aged eight to 15. Tween marketing has spread beyond Western countries. In India, marketing research shows children in the 8- to 14-year-old age range, predominantly girls, shifting their preferences away from traditional products towards mass-marketed merchandise such as the Disney Princess and Frozen franchises.  \nTween girls became identified as a huge market during the 1990s. The pop music group the Spice Girls were an act based on a group of female performers representing character traits, with nicknames such as Scary Spice, Baby Spice, and Sporty Spice. They were originally a less edgy variation on the girl-group character acts such as the Mary Jane Girls organized by Rick James and Vanity 6 created by Prince, with an intended teenage audience. To the surprise of the recording industry, the Spice Girls were an enormous success with prepubescent tween girls, who identified with the flirtatious sexuality of the group and the \"Girl Power\" theme, which marketers subsequently promoted to the hilt. In 1998, the year the Spice Girls enjoyed their peak success, tweens spent an estimated $1.4 billion, according to a YTV Tween report. Marketing to tween girls is a full-fledged entertainment industry trend today, with toys and merchandise associated with television shows, music groups and celebrities, for example Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez.  \nIn addition to toys such as dolls marketing to girls, they use common ideas and representations of toys that will make the biggest profits. Taking a look at Barbie dolls, there are many different editions of Barbie that make tributes to celebrities and other aspects of culture. Some of these editions include Marilyn Monroe, Diana Ross, Audrey Hepburn, Harley Davidson, and many more. The company Mattel uses idea they know will sell best, in addition to this they make sure the dolls have a certain appearance; small waist, thin legs, and large breasts. They are marketing not only what gives the biggest dollar value, but as well as following the guidelines for typical views of beauty within these types of toys. The toys along with the messages they send about body images are then mass produced to be sold to the audience of mostly girls ranging from toddlers to tweens. The dolls often lack many features that would help make them more realistic, and send believable body image message to girls. Some of the features neglected to be shown on dolls such as Barbie's include: nipples, wombs, skin flaws, and the various skin tones found around the globe. This leaves the realistic view of women out, and instead changes it for blank features that is wanted by the public.  \n## Technology and toys  \nHello Kitty Dreamcast set, 2009  \nTechnology has been embraced by many toy companies because of the gender-neutral best-selling toys that it helps create. One example is the popular Tamagotchi toy invented in Japan in the 1990s. It has sold tens of millions of units worldwide in its various versions. The Tamagotchi is an egg-shaped computerized toy that mimics a pet, and requires that the user update it regularly to feed it and provide other care. It remains particularly popular with young girls, however, and recent marketing is targeted towards girls; girls \"like the new outfits and other items that can be downloaded via cellphone and transferred to their Tamagotchi device\".  \nGirls' video games were a trend in the 1990s where video game developers attempted to make video games aimed specifically at girls. The genre did not see much critical or commercial success, and a leading developer, Purple Moon, was bought by Mattel in 1999.  \nIn 2014, Moose Toys developed Shopkins toys which are about one inch in size and targeted at girls. Shopkins later released a number of Shopkins games for Android and iOS devices, and in  Adobe Flash format  The most popular game in the series is Shopkins World, which crossed 5 million downloads.  \nWorldwide video game sales have soared beyond traditional toy and game sales in the past decade,date=March 2018 particularly in North America and the Middle East. The Nintendo Wii console sells games aimed at either girls or boys, or both. Large traditional toy companies such as Hasbro have also created game applications for the iPhone and other smartphones, which are increasingly being used by children in affluent countries.  \n### STEM Toys  \nIn 2020, the Australian market research group PLAY reported that STEM toys (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) were trending in the toy industry, specifically those aimed at young girls. Traditionally these toys have been solely marketed towards boys, with both masculine explicit and implicit labels. \"Pinkification\" is a common strategy used in marketing to create a binary or segment the toy market by colour. This is seen in girls\u2019 toy brands like Barbie, but it is also apparent in some of the new rebranding efforts of STEM toy makers, like GoldieBlox and Lego, who are trying to appeal to feminine audiences. While it might be a \u201cgood faith attempt at progress it could remind girls to shun anything that isn\u2019t pink.\u201d and be a limiting factor both girls, and the boys who may avoid pink packaging altogether. A study by Coyle and Liben examined the effects of gender\u2013typed packaging in STEM toys on mother-child dyads. This study found that children had differential comfort with toys packaged for their own experienced gender but resulted less attention and mastery of the specific STEM concept. Girls were found to generally learn the concept better playing with the masculine version but were freer to play and explore the pieces with original version, and vice versa for boys.  \n## History  \n<ImageHere>Detail from Children's Games by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1560), showing Flemish girls playing popular games of the era\nPaintings of girl with dolls  \nThe oldest toys for girls are dolls that date from around 2000 BCE in Egypt. Children in Ancient Greece played with dolls made of rags, wood, wax or clay, sometimes with moveable arms and legs. Rattles, hoops and yo-yos were other common toys. When a young woman was to be married in Ancient Greece, she would sacrifice her dolls and toys and other youthful possessions to Artemis the night before her wedding.  \nChildren's games during the Middle Ages and earlier are something of a mystery, since the rules of the games were passed from generation to generation orally. In rare cases, the games survived long enough to be recorded in later centuries. Pieter Bruegel's painting Children's Games (1560) depicts many games popular with Flemish children of the time. Girls can be shown playing games that involve balls, musical instruments, and games that involved carrying other children or performing other challenges. Hide-and-seek, leapfrog and tag are some perennially popular games that seem to have survived over the centuries in Europe and North America.  \nFashion dolls were creations used by adults in early modern Europe. Fashion dolls were prototype samples of clothing styles, passed between adults who were involved in designing or purchasing expensive dresses and suits. Once the dolls were outdated, they were apparently given to girls as toys. A recent trend in the Barbie doll line in particular is to produce \"collectors\" versions of the doll marketed to adults, with Barbie wearing historic couture reproductions.  \nBoard games, paper dolls, doll houses and other toys were creations of the Victorian era that remain popular today. Other historic and vintage girls' pastimes include Paper fortune tellers, which date from the 1920s.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a historical trend in girls' toys that has been subject to recent scrutiny and debate due to concerns about reinforcing gender stereotypes?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nContext:\n# Salzburg Conference  \n<ImageHere>Jozef Tiso and Adolf Hitler at the Salzburg Conference\nThe Salzburg Conference (Salzburger Diktat)  was a conference between Nazi Germany and the Slovak State, held on 28 July 1940, in Salzburg, Reichsgau Ostmark (present-day Austria). The Germans demanded the expulsion of the N\u00e1stup faction of the Slovak People's Party from the Slovak government because of its independent foreign policy, threatening to unilaterally revoke the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the 1939 German\u2013Slovak treaty.  \nThe result was Slovak capitulation to German demands and the replacement of N\u00e1stup supporters by members of the pro-German radical faction. Ultimately, the Slovak State became more strongly oriented towards Germany, especially in the area of anti-Jewish measures. However, aspects of the Slovak State's administration, such as the lack of qualified Slovak People's Party supporters in high-level positions and the adoption of the F\u00fchrerprinzip with the conservative politician Jozef Tiso as its supreme leader, limited the impact of the German ultimatum.\n\n## Background  \nSlovak territorial losses to Hungary in 1938 and 1939  \n<ImageHere>Joachim von Ribbentrop (right) meets the Prime Minister of Romania, Ion Gigurtu, in Salzburg, 27 July 1940\nNazi Germany and Fascist Italy awarded much of southern Slovakia (then part of Czechoslovakia) to Hungary with the First Vienna Award in November 1938. On 14 March 1939, the Slovak State proclaimed its independence under German protection, with Germany invading and annexing the Czech rump state the following day. In a treaty signed on 23 March, Slovakia renounced much of its foreign-policy and military autonomy to Germany in exchange for border guarantees and economic assistance.  \nThe Slovak State was a one-party state dominated by the Slovak People's Party, which had two main factions, radical and conservative/clerical. The radical branch was led by Vojtech Tuka and Alexander Mach, commander of the paramilitary Hlinka Guard, and was supported by Germany due to its acceptance of German dominion. President Jozef Tiso's clerical branch was more popular among the Catholic clergy and the population. These factions engaged in a power struggle, fighting for German support. Another faction was a group of intellectuals centered around the journal N\u00e1stup, which was radical in its authoritarianism but opposed the imitation of Germany and insisted on an independent foreign policy; foreign minister Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd belonged to this group. Germany sought the expulsion of the N\u00e1stup group from positions of influence, as it could work with Tiso's faction which tended towards pragmatism in its foreign policy.  \nThe summit took place during a quiet spell in the war, shortly after the fall of France and while the defeat of the United Kingdom and victory of Nazi Germany appeared likely. Germany's military successes strengthened its negotiating position against its much smaller ally. Germany sought to use the favorable conditions to deepen its sphere of influence in the Danube region and force its allies in the area into a closer relationship. Shortly before the summit, Hitler had met with Hungarian officials on 10 July, and with Romanian and Bulgarian officials on the two nights immediately preceding the Salzburg meeting.\n\n## Demands  \nIn mid-July 1940, German dictator Adolf Hitler invited Tiso, Tuka, and Mach to a summit held in Salzburg. The Sicherheitsdienst wanted \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd to be invited, so that it could thwart any attempts by the latter to escape losing power.  \nOn 28 July, Tiso first met privately with German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, who informed the Slovaks that Germany considered Slovakia within its Lebensraum, and therefore justified interference in Slovakia's internal affairs. He demanded that Tiso renounce his goal of a Catholic clerical state and dismiss  \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd, due to the latter's \"register of sins\"\u2014he had attempted to maintain communication with the Western powers and keep friendly relations with the Soviet Union. In another meeting, Adolf Hitler hinted that failure to comply would leave the Slovak State at the mercy of Hungary, by revoking the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the 1939 German\u2013Slovak treaty. Tiso told Hitler that Slovakia had no \"leanings toward Russia within the framework of a Pan-Slavic policy. \u2026 The leaflets backing such actions were machinations of Jews, Magyars, and Czechs designed to blacken Slovakia in the eyes of Germany.\"  \nThe Slovaks requested a revision of the First Vienna Award. Specifically, they wanted six former districts to be returned to Slovakia: Vr\u00e1ble-\u0160urany, Lu\u010denec,  Jel\u0161ava,  Ko\u0161ice,  north S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely  and Sobrance District\u2014km2. According to the Slovak foreign ministry, these areas contained 209,000 Slovaks and 100,000 Hungarians. During the meeting with Hitler Ribbentrop interjected to say that a revision was \"out of the question\".  \nAccording to Israeli historian Yeshayahu A. Jelinek, \"we lack many  details regarding the meeting, particularly  about instructions, if any, given to Tuka and Mach\".  \n## Result  \nTiso and Hitler shake hands at the conference  \nThe Slovaks conceded to the German ultimatum and agreed to replace influential N\u00e1stupists with reliably pro-German radicals. \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd was replaced as interior minister by Mach, while Tuka became foreign minister. sk, another N\u00e1stupist, was dismissed as Secretary-General of the Slovak People's Party, while Kon\u0161tant\u00edn \u010culen, the head of the Propaganda Ministry, was replaced by the radical Karol  Murga\u0161. Nevertheless, the Germans recognized that the radical candidates were not as competent as the men that they replaced, and were therefore careful not to go too far in demanding influential offices for them. \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd later claimed that his dismissal proved that he was anti-Nazi and actually a \"friend\" of Jews.  \nThe conference marked a success for the radical faction of the party and a defeat for Tiso's clerical faction. Tiso considered the summit \"the worst box on the ears that I ever received\". He offered his resignation. None of the Slovak leaders (except Mach) was happy with the result; Tuka had hoped to become president or defense minister and was ill-equipped to deal with the demands of the new offices he had obtained.  \nAfter the conference, the new government \"oriented definitively and exclusively on Germany\", in the words of Jan Rychl\u00edk. The conference also resulted in an intensification of the Slovak State's anti-Jewish policy, which was now modeled on that of Germany. As a reaction to the Salzburg talks, the Slovak People's Party embraced the F\u00fchrerprinzip (\"F\u00fchrer principle\"), putting Tiso in a position of complete authority and bypassing the German-mandated political changes. Another effect that limited the effect of the German diktat was that there were few Slovak People's Party supporters qualified for high office, partly because of the reliance of the Czechoslovak state on Czech bureaucrats. Therefore, the government relied heavily on Slovaks who did not support the party (four-fifths of the Foreign Affairs officials who had reported directly to \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd had held similar positions in the Czechoslovak government and were almost certainly not Slovak People's Party supporters). Leading officials such as Karol Klinovsk, head of the Presidium of the Slovak Foreign Ministry since 1939, were left undisturbed for lack of a qualified replacement.  \n### Advisers  \n<ImageHere>Manfred von Killinger meets Tiso (center) and Tuka (left), August 1940\nAnother result of the Salzburg talks was the appointment of various German advisers to Slovakia, although these advisers were not completely new, nor were they unique to Slovakia. The previous German envoy Hans Bernard (Diplomat) was replaced by Manfred von Killinger, a Sturmabteilung officer who described his purpose as making Slovakia \"economically  100 per  cent  at  our  disposal\". Killinger was accompanied by a staff of German economic experts.

The origins of the indigenous itinerant groups are unclear. They have been assumed to have taken up the travelling lifestyle out of necessity at some point during the Early Modern period but to not be ethnically distinct from their source population. However, recent DNA testing has shown that the Irish Travellers are of Irish origin but are genetically distinct from their settled counterparts due to social isolation, and more groups are being studied.  \nMany groups speak their own language or dialect (distinct from the settled population); it is often a blend of the local settled language and Romani language, even in non-Romani groups. The largest of these groups are the Romani people, who have Indian roots and heritage, who left India around 1,500 years ago entering Europe around 1,000 years ago; this includes the Sinti people, who are themselves the second largest group. The third largest group in Europe is the Yenish, an indigenous Germanic group. As opposed to nomads who travel with and subsist on herds of livestock, itinerant groups traditionally travel for trade or other work for the sedentary populations amongst which they live.\n\n## Indigenous Dutch Travellers (Woonwagenbewoners)  \nIndigenous Dutch Travellers, known in the Netherlands as lang|nl|woonwagenbewoners (caravan dwellers), were first recorded as a population in the 1879 census, but have existed since the advent of industrial mechanization in the first half of the 19th century. They travelled around in search of employment and practised traditional professions like chair bottomers, tinsmiths, broom binders, traders, peddlers, artisans, etc. As of 2018, some 30,000\u201360,000 Travellers live in the Netherlands, most of whom are Catholics living in the south of the country. Many Travellers used to speak the cant language lang|nl|Bargoens and a derivative sociolect continues to exist.  \nLiving in trailer parks or \"caravan camps\" gave rise to the pejorative name kampers to refer to Dutch Travellers, while the latter prefer to call themselves reizigers (travellers). In turn, Travellers have used the terms lang|nl|burger and lang|nl|kaffer against those who live in regular housing. Similar to indigenous Norwegian Travellers, Dutch and Flemish Travellers are theorised to have Yenish (German) admixture.  \n## Indigenous Flemish Travellers (Voyageurs)  \nare an indigenous Flemish group who are related to the Dutch Travellers. The first voyageurs slept in stables and barns they encountered in the countryside along the way. It was only later that they started building covered wagons, a simple cart with a tarpaulin over it, which they pulled themselves or for which they harnessed some dogs. Even later the horses came, and the hood carts grew into caravans.  \nThese voyageurs had their example in the nomadic way of life of mainly the Sinti. They partially adopted each other's customs, and mixed marriages were not uncommon. From this mixture of Romani and Western culture, a subculture of their own has emerged. Many also currently live in houses, which makes tracking them difficult. In addition, some are at such an advanced stage of integration into sedentary society that they do not know or deny that they are descendants of voyageurs, ashamed of an ancestor who walked from door to door. Their number is currently estimated at 8,000, but could be much higher. They are spread all over Flanders.  \n## Indigenous Norwegian Travellers (Sk\u00f8yere/Fantefolk)  \nIndigenous Norwegian Travellers (more commonly known as Fanter, Fantefolk or Sk\u00f8yere) are an itinerant group who call themselves Reisende. Confusingly, this term is also used by lang|rmg|Romanis\u00e6l, the Romani group of Norway and Sweden. Unlike the Romanis\u00e6l Travellers, the indigenous Norwegian Travellers are non-Romani by culture and origins, and they do not speak any form of Romani language. Instead, their language is 'Rodi', which is a Norwegian dialect.  \nSimilar to indigenous Dutch and Flemish Travellers, indigenous Norwegian Travellers are theorised to have Yenish (German Traveller) admixture and possibly could be descended from them. Norwegian Rodi includes a large proportion of Yenish loanwords. Rodi also has a handful of Scandoromani loanwords due to Romanis\u00e6l Travellers and indigenous Norwegian Travellers both living in close proximity to each other.  \nIndigenous Norwegian Travellers have always concentrated around Southern and Southwestern Norway along the coastline (which was separated from the rest of Norway due to mountains) and Romanis\u00e6l Travellers have always concentrated around Central Norway (specifically in Tr\u00f8ndelag county around the city of Trondheim). Historically, both groups have travelled all over, and often overlap into each other's traditional areas.  \nThey are known to the settled majority population as fant or fanter, but they prefer the term reisende ('travellers'). This term is also used by Romanis\u00e6l Travellers (the largest population of Romani people in Norway and Sweden), though the two groups are distinct. There are also groups in German-speaking countries who refer to themselves as reisende, which is German for 'travellers'. Eilert Sundt, a 19th-century sociologist, termed the indigenous Travellers sm\u00e5vandrer or sm\u00e5vandringer ('small travellers'), to contrast them with the Romanis\u00e6l (Tater) Travellers, which Sundt called storvandrer or storvandringer ('great travellers') who ranged further in their journeys.  \n## Irish Travellers (Pavee)  \nBy DNA, the Pavees are Irish, but have a separate language and culture than the settled Irish. They live predominantly in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Travellers refer to themselves as Minc\u00e9ir\u00ed or Pavees in their own language or in Irish as an Lucht Si\u00fail, meaning literally \"the walking people\". The language of the Irish Travellers, Shelta, is mainly based on an Irish lexicon and an English grammar. There are two dialects of this language: Gammon (or Gamin) and Cant. It has been dated back to the eighteenth century but may be older. The vast majority of Irish Travellers are Roman Catholics who maintain their traditions and culture in a close knit community of families.  \nIn 2011, an analysis of DNA from 40 Travellers showed that Irish Travellers are a distinct Indigenous Irish ethnic minority who separated from the settled Irish community at least 1,000 years ago; the claim was made that they are as distinct from the settled community as Icelanders are from Norwegians.  \nLike other itinerant groups they have often been racially discriminated against in the past and still are today. They were only recognised as an official ethnic group in the Republic of Ireland on March 1, 2017.  \n## Northern Romani Travellers  \nNorthern Romani Traveller groups include:  \n* Romanichal Travellers in England (As well as North East Wales, South Wales and the Scottish Borders), with diaspora communities in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  \n* Welsh Kale Travellers in the Welsh-speaking parts of Northwestern Wales.  \n* Scottish Lowland Travellers in Lowland Scotland.  \n* Romanis\u00e6l Travellers in Central Norway and Sweden.  \n* Finnish Kale in Finland and parts of Sweden.  \nThese groups have much European blood due to mixing with Indigenous Traveller groups (British Romani Travellers mix with Irish Travellers, Scottish Highland Travellers and Funfair Traveller and Scandinavian Romani Travellers mix with Indigenous Norwegian Travellers) and even non-Travellers over the centuries. This has led to these Romani groups generally looking White in appearance.  \nIt is also a reason why these groups speak mixed languages rather than more pure forms of Romani:  \n* Romanichal Travellers speak Angloromani (A mix of English and Romani).  \n* Romanis\u00e6l Travellers speak Scandoromani (A mix of Norwegian, Swedish and Romani).  \n* Scottish Lowland Travellers speak Scottish Cant (A mix of Scots and Romani).  \n* Welsh Kale speak Kal\u00e1 (A mix of Welsh, English and Romani).  \n* Finnish Kale speak Kalo (A mix of Finnish and Romani).  \n## Romani/Gypsies  \n<ImageHere>Sinti Romanies in the Rhineland, 1935\nThe best known itinerant community are the Romani people (also Romany, Romanies Tzigani, Rromani, and variants).  \nThe Romani have Indo-Aryan roots and heritage and first entered Europe via the Middle East around a thousand years ago. They spread further through Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, separating into various subgroups in the process.  \nThey speak Romani, an Indo-Aryan language.\n\n## Indigenous Scottish Highland Travellers  \nScottish Highland Travellers are also known as Ceardannan in Scottish Gaelic (which means \"the craftsmen\" or 'Black Tinkers') or more poetically as the \"Summer Walkers\".  \nThe Highland Traveller community has a long history in Scotland going back on record to at least the 12th century. Historically they would travel from village to village and would pitch their bow-tents on rough ground around the edge of a village and would earn money there as tinsmiths, hawkers, horse dealers or pearl-fishermen. Many found seasonal employment on farms, e.g. doing berry picking or during harvests. Nowadays the majority of Highland Travellers have settled down into organized campsites or regular houses.  \nThe Scottish Highland Travellers have their own (nearly extinct) language based on Scottish Gaelic called Beurla Reagaird.  \nHighland Travellers are closely tied to their native Highlands and the native Gaelic speaking population; they may follow an itinerant or a settled lifestyle. They have played an essential role in the preservation of traditional Gaelic culture. Travellers' outstanding contribution to Highland life has been as custodians of an ancient and vital Gaelic singing, storytelling and folklore tradition of great importance. It is estimated that there are only 2,000 Highland Travellers leading their traditional lifestyle.  \n## Yenish Travellers  \n<ImageHere>Two Jenische in Muotathal, Switzerland, 1890\nIn German-speaking Europe, France and Wallonia, there are the Yenish people (Jenische or Yeniche in German and French spelling, respectively).  \nAn early description of this group was published by Johann Ulrich Sch\u00f6ll in 1793.\n\n## Funfair Travellers (Showmen)  \nShowmen, also known as Funfair Travellers or Travelling Showpeople, are the members of families who own travelling funfairs and circuses, and are referred to as occupational travelers, who move around as part of their work. These groups formed across Europe, and included the families of travelling funfairs and circuses that required frequent mobility. These groups usually follow a set pattern of yearly nomadism. Membership of these groups has, over the years, been drawn from other communities. For example, Showmen in Great Britain and Ireland often had a mix of English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, and/or Traveller (typically Romanichal Traveller and Irish Traveller) heritage.  \nAs a result, Funfair Travellers are not defined as an ethnic group, even though they display certain common features, although in many countries (such as the UK) they identify as a cultural group.  \nFunfair Travellers often sport unique cultures and self-identity, and they tend to be insular, favouring marriage within the community, which results in long lineages and a strong sense of cultural homogeneity. For example, the Showman's Guild of Great Britain requires that applicants have a parent from the Funfair Travelling community.  \nMany Funfair Travellers in the fairground and circus business across Europe have partial Romani heritage, evidenced by significant traces of the Romani language and matriarchal forms of social organisation. Despite this, the roots, culture, traditions, and identity of showman groups have remained separate from Romani groups.  \n## Camminanti  \nThe Camminanti are an ethnic group in Sicily, originating from the end of the 14th century. They have historically lived a nomadic life.\n\nQuestion: Which group of itinerant people are depicted in the second image, known for their Indo-Aryan roots and heritage, and for speaking an Indo-Aryan language?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nContext:\n# List of Billboard number-one country songs of 1952  \nIn 1952, Billboard magazine published three charts covering the best-performing country music songs in the United States.  At the start of the year, the charts were published under the titles Most-Played Juke Box (Country & Western) Records, Best-Selling Retail Folk (Country & Western) Records and Country & Western Records Most Played By Folk Disk Jockeys.  Beginning with the issue of Billboard dated November 15, the titles of the charts were changed to Most Played in Juke Boxes, National Best Sellers, and Most Played By Jockeys respectively, with the genre denoted in an overall page title rather than within the titles of the charts themselves.  All three charts are considered part of the lineage of the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart, which was first published in 1958.  \nIn the first issue of Billboard of the year, \"Slow Poke\" by Pee Wee King retained its place at number one on both the juke box and retail charts from the previous week but was displaced from the top spot on the jockeys chart by Carl Smith's \"Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way\".  Smith had three number-one country songs in 1952, two of which topped all three listings.  Webb Pierce was the only other artist to take as many as three different songs to the top spot in 1952, although none of his songs reached number one on all three charts during the year.  The longest-running number one on both the juke box and retail charts was \"The Wild Side of Life\" by Hank Thompson, which on both listings  spent fifteen consecutive weeks in the top spot before being replaced by \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" by Kitty Wells.  Wells' song, which had been written as an answer song to \"The Wild Side of Life\", was the first million-selling country single by a female artist and the first Billboard country number one by a solo female.  Despite this success, it did not top the jockeys chart, as the song's lyrics were deemed too controversial by some radio stations.  \nThe longest-running number one on the jockeys chart was \"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\" by Hank Williams, which spent thirteen non-consecutive weeks atop the chart.   The Cajun-inspired song was the final number one of the year on both that chart and the retail listing and was thus in the top spot when Williams died early on January 1, 1953.  The year's final number one on the juke box chart was \"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\" by Skeets McDonald, which reached the peak position in the issue of Billboard dated December 27.  McDonald's version of the song reached the top spot three weeks after its writer, Slim Willet, had taken his own recording of the track to number one on the jockeys chart.  The song would prove to be the only country number one for both McDonald and Willet and both had only short chart careers; in Willet's case it was his only charting song.  In contrast, the three other singers who reached number one for the first time in 1952 would go on to achieve further chart-toppers and be elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame in recognition of their long and successful careers.  Hank Thompson and Kitty Wells each gained the first of three number ones in 1952 and remained top 10 regulars until the late 1960s.  Webb Pierce topped the jockeys chart in March with \"Wondering\", his first charting song.  It was the first of 12 number ones which the singer gained in less than four years, and he achieved more than 80 top 40 entries during his career.  \n## Chart history  \n<ImageHere>alt=A dark-haired man wearing a neckerchief, a shirt with fringes dangling from the sleeves, and pants with a guitar pictured on them, smiling broadly while leaning on a guitar\n\n<ImageHere>alt=A man wearing a cowboy hat and a light-colored jacket, holding a guitar\n\n<ImageHere>alt=A fair-haired man in a dark jacket and light-coloured sweater playing a guitar and singing\n\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows a man wearing a neckerchief and a shirt with fringes dangling from the sleeves?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nRick Ross is featured on numerous tracks, including the single \"Believe It\".\nDreams and Nightmares begins with the title track, which relies on piano stabs and strings. The track has a beat switch in the middle to transition from the dreams to the nightmares portion; Mill changes from celebrating victory to rapping angrily about issues in his past. \"In God We Trust\" features a maximalist beat, over which Mill raps forcefully about killing a man. \"Young & Gettin' It\" contains elements of club and usage of Auto-Tune, with lyrics about the strength to sell drugs from Mill and a hook from fellow rapper Kirko Bangz. Soul elements, hallow chimes, and filtered moans back Mill hypothesizing a conversation warning his father's murderer he will kill him on \"Traumatized\", expressing loss and regret. \"Believe It\" begins with Rick Ross referencing Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber, before Mill touches on struggle and triumph. Rick Ross appears on the next track \"Maybach Curtains\", alongside Nas' guest verse and crooning from Legend. The track features pop and R&B elements, and Mill recalls drug dealing. \"Amen\" maintains these elements and has a gospel beat, alongside Mill and Drake discussing sexual exploitation and excessive wealth.  \nOn \"Young Kings\", Mill recalls the pressure of drug dealing, as well as lamenting his father's death and expressing \"fuck fame\" to focus on his money. \"Lay Up\" is a pop slow jam that sees him reference admiration of his status, featuring Wale showing off to women and an appearance from Rick Ross. \"Tony Story Pt. 2\" serves as a sequel to the track from Mill's 2011 mixtape Dreamchasers and utilizes windshield wipers as percussion, with the rapper telling the story of gunplay leading into the tragedy of death. \"Who You're Around\" features Mill meditating on damaged personal friendships, joined by Blige on the chorus. On \"Polo & Shell Tops\", Mill raps about resorting to selling crack cocaine to earn money and get revenge on others. \"Rich & Famous\" is a pop track, which includes Mill speaking of material wealth and spending time with a woman. On \"Real Niggas Come First\", Mill reminisces on drug dealing. \"Burn\" is an up-tempo number, which sees Mill and fellow rapper Big Sean perform back and forth. \"Freak Show\" is a club number set in a similar tempo, featuring rapper 2 Chainz and DJ Sam Sneaker, with a refrain referencing fellatio.\n\n## Release and promotion  \nAt the start of October 2012, Mill shared the cover art for the album. The artwork uses Mill's gold Rolex watch for symbolizing dreams, alongside handcuffs for nightmares. Complex named the album cover the 18th best of 2012. At the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, Mill performed \"Amen\" and \"Young & Gettin' It\". During the months leading up to October, Mill played the album for Jay-Z and appreciated the feedback from someone of his status, getting along well with him personally. In mid-October 2012, Mill and Rick Ross previewed it at Electric Lady Studios in NYC for rappers such as Jay-Z, Will Smith, and Wale, as well as singers Estelle and The-Dream. Mill declared that he was staying true to his early days with \"In God We Trust\", delivering \"that hard street shit\" unlike much of mainstream rap. At the premiere, Rick Ross said about Mill: \"I'm proud of my homie. Everything he has accomplished, he earned himself.\"  \nOn October 19, 2012, Mill premiered \"Maybach Curtains\". The next week, he appeared on MTV's weekly show RapFix Live to promote Dreams and Nightmares, performing his scrapped second verse from the song. Hours before his appearance, the album leaked online and Mill responded by telling host Sway Calloway, \"I ain't tripping. If people wanna buy your album, they're gonna buy your album whether it's gonna leak or not.\" Dreams and Nightmares was released on October 30, 2012, through Mill's labels Maybach and Warner Bros. The deluxe version was released simultaneously, featuring \"Burn\" and \"Freak Show\". A day after the album's release, Mill held a release party in Atlanta, arriving on time after being detained. On January 27, 2013, a music video for the title track was released, documenting Mill's career up to Dreams and Nightmares.  \n### Singles  \n\"Amen\" was released for digital download and streaming as the lead single from Dreams and Nightmares on June 19, 2012, by Maybach and Warner Bros. A month earlier, the song had been included on Dreamchasers 2. The song's music video was released on June 15, 2012, interspersing footage of Mill and Drake partying late at night with clips of the Club Paradise Tour. \"Amen\" reached number 57 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and it was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for pushing 500,000 certified units in the United States in July 2015. \"Burn\" was released to download and streaming formats in the US as the second single on September 11, 2012, through Mill's labels. Like \"Amen\", the song was first released on the mixtape. An accompanying music video premiered on October 10, 2012, which features Mill and Big Sean accompanied by models and exploding cars inside a warehouse. The song topped the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. \"Burn\" was awarded a gold certification from the RIAA for amassing 500,000 certified units in the US in May 2019.  \nOn September 19, 2012, \"Young & Gettin' It\" was released as the third single from Dreams and Nightmares and the first one not from the mixtape. The song's music video was debuted on September 28, showing Mill and Kirko Bangz partying on a yacht, before changing to Miami. \"Young & Gettin' It\" reached number 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it was certified gold by the RIAA for shelving 500,000 certified units in July 2017.  On February 19, 2013, \"Believe It\" was sent to US urban contemporary radio stations as the album's fourth and final single by Maybach and Warner Bros. An accompanying music video premiered on March 24, beginning with Mill and Rick Ross making a business transaction in the desert and then partying in Las Vegas. The song peaked at number 22 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.  \n### Concerts  \nIn late June 2012, Mill announced his Dreamchasers Tour to promote Dreams and Nightmares, performing at 16 cities across the US. Mill subsequently shared its poster alongside footage of him engaging in activities like performing and driving fast vehicles, accompanied by a list of accolades and the opening caption \"Dream chasing is an occupation\". Tickets were made available on June 30, 2012, via Ticketmaster and Live Nation. Mill posted \"All Access\" footage in August, showing him and his team riding around on vehicles such as dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles. The tour kicked off at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado on August 2, 2012, while it finished 25 days later at Irving Plaza in New York City (NYC). DJ sets by DJ Drama and Casey Veggies were included on the Dreamchasers Tour, as well as cameos from rappers like Yo Gotti, Bow Wow, Ace Hood, Waka Flocka Flame, and T.I.  \n<ImageHere>Mill performed the concert \"Meek Mill + Friends: Dreams and Nightmares Ten Year Anniversary\" at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center in November 2022\nAt the end of October 2022, Mill announced a 10th anniversary concert on Instagram, billed as \"Meek Mill + Friends: Dreams and Nightmares Ten Year Anniversary\". Mill also revealed a promotional poster and that it was set to take place at the Wells Fargo Center in his hometown of Philadelphia on November 26, coinciding with Thanksgiving in the US. Tickets for the event went on sale via the venue's website at 10 a.m. in early November 2022, although the rapper did not disclose any of the guests initially. The musical direction was handled by Gil Smith II.  \nPrior to Mill appearing at the Wells Fargo Center, footage played from the early days of his career with the \"nappy braids that locked\", then his Flamers mixtapes, the release of Dreams and Nightmares, and finally the icon he had widely become. \"Friends\" in the concert's title was represented by the rappers that joined Mill, including Fabulous, Fivio Foreign, Jim Jones, and A Boogie wit da Hoodie. Mill performed a few tracks from his recently released mixtape Flamers 5, as well as popular album tracks such as \"1942 Flows\" (2017) and \"Respect the Game\" (2018). He ended rumours of tensions with Rick Ross by bringing him out to perform \"I'm a Boss\" (2011), while Mill accompanied the rapper as he performed his own tracks. Mill finished the event by performing \"Dreams and Nightmares\", telling the crowd he appreciated their support from his time at the bottom and he raps for Philadelphia.\n\n## Critical reception  \nDreams and Nightmares was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 17 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.0 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.  \nAllMusic's  Jeffries asserted that the album succeeds in the themes of both dreams and nightmares, finalizing it \"is still satisfying and a step forward\" for an album release after mixtapes, \"slicked up and pimped out in a way that's entirely Maybach\". Similarly, Sargent from Pitchfork celebrated the record's transition to the mainstream after Mill's mixtapes for being \"distinct in both voice and sound\" as it shows his strengths, highlighting his emotion and themes. The staff of XXL declared that \"Dreams and Nightmares doesn't break new grounds in hip-hop\", serving as a release for Mill to gain respect \"on the verge of universal acceptance\" like Rick Ross and Wale similarly did.  \nMarcus J. Moore of BBC Music thought Mill's character of \"a decent wordsmith with a gruff disposition\" seemed obvious and the album \"won't break new ground\" in hip hop, feeling somewhat underwhelmed by the compositions and lyrics, yet observing \"a respectable effort that ... moves him beyond illicit history\". Edwin Ortiz from HipHopDX said the album proves that \"Mill needs more time before he can rightfully call himself the lieutenant of the MMG army\", concluding it is \"a dream that could be forgotten by mid-day\". Rytlewski was less enthusiastic in The A.V. Club, seeing the album as another addition to the \"already distinguished discography\" of Mill's mixtapes and appearances on Maybach compilations. He grudgingly acknowledged the responsibility of following standards for debuts through the likes of \"sweeping themes\" and reflective lyricism, concluding Mill's execution is competent and the conventional focus only takes him backwards.  \n### Accolades  \nDreams and Nightmares appeared on year-end lists for 2012 of multiple publications. Rap Radar listed the album as the seventh best of the year; Paul \"Big Homie\" Duong believed that Mill continued the success of his Dreamchasers mixtapes and tells \"the prison walls to the hall of fame storyline\" to a top level, concluding \"this is what dreams are truly made of\". The Source named Dreams and Nightmares as the 18th best album of 2012, while journalist Chris Morris picked it as the 10th best hip hop album for North Country Public Radio. The record was named the 15th best hip hop album of the year by Spin. For the 2014 issue of XXL that celebrated 40 years of hip hop, it was listed as one of the five best albums of 2012.  \n## Commercial performance  \nDreams and Nightmares debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 165,000 units and becoming the highest debut of the week. It was held off the top spot by singer Taylor Swift's Red, while the opening sales were only 1,000 apart from Wale's 2011 album Ambition that reached the same position. HipHopDX had predicted that Dreams and Nightmares would reach the top three of the chart, estimating 175,000 to 200,000 first-week sales. It entered the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart at number one.  \nIn its second tracking week, the album sold 41,000 copies, reaching 206,000 units in the US. By July 2015, it had amassed 414,000 units. In May 2016, Dreams and Nightmares was awarded a gold certification from the RIAA for reaching 500,000 certified units in the US. Despite not being released as a single, the title track was certified double platinum by the RIAA for amassing 2,000,000 certified units in the country three years later. The album experience lesser success in Canada, peaking at number six on the Canadian Albums Chart. In the United Kingdom, it reached number five on the UK R&B Albums Chart.  \n## Track listing  \nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.  \nNotes  \n* signifies a co-producer  \nSample credits  \n* \"Amen\" contains an interpolation of \"Minute by Minute\", written by Lester Abrams and Michael McDonald, and performed by The Doobie Brothers  \n* \"Freak Show\" contains a sample from \"Slob on My Knob\", written by Jordan Houston and Paul Beauregard, and performed by Tear Da Club Up Thugs  \n## Personnel  \nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.  \n* Jeremih \u2013 uncredited vocals (7)  \n* Finis \"KY White\" \u2013 mixing (1, 2, 7, 14)  \n* Fabian Marasciullo \u2013 mixing (14)  \n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering (3)  \n* Justin Smith \u2013 mastering (3)  \n## Charts  \n### Weekly charts  \n### Year-end charts  \n## Certifications\n\nQuestion: Which artist was featured on the track \"Believe It\" from the album \"Dreams and Nightmares\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\n impact on the film outside of a brief reference to the Avengers at the end of the trailer. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Nick Romano felt the teaser was a combination of \"thrilling, goosebump-inducing moments\" and some jokes. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club felt the spot teased some fresh angles for the MCU in a similar way to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and he enjoyed the images of Kingo's Bollywood dance, Sprite performing karaoke, and the end scene of the Eternals eating together and joking about the Avengers. After seeing the teaser, Variety Adam B. Vary described the film as \"unquestionably a Chlo\u00e9 Zhao movie\", but wished more action set pieces were featured in the teaser to see how Zhao would approach them in the film. Adele Ankers of IGN discussed the poster that was released at the same time as the trailer, highlighting how the Eternals appear in silhouette against a sunlit background which she described as \"another taste of Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's signature filming style and the use of natural light to illuminate a frame\" that would be seen in the film. Upon release, the teaser quickly became the number one trending video on YouTube and amassed 77 million global views in its first 24 hours. Disney's president of marketing Asad Ayaz said the teaser was designed to just be an introduction to the characters and tone and not give much of the film away, adding the marketing team would be \"very judicious\" on when more material would be revealed, while also using the releases of Black Widow and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings before Eternals to help expose audiences to the characters.  \nThe final trailer was released in August 2021, with Ethan Shanfeld and Manori Ravindran of Variety feeling it was \"more serious in tone\" than the teaser with the Eternals \"grappling with the prospect of emerging after centuries living apart in order to help humans\". Entertainment Weekly Devan Coggan felt that the trailer was the \"best glimpse yet\" of the film and gave a \"sense of the vast scale and scope of the film\", while answering \"one important question\" about the absence of the Eternals during the conflict against Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Aaron Couch at The Hollywood Reporter said the trailer \"reveals much of the film's plot as well as its characters' powers, teasing the answers to key questions about who the Eternals answer to, their relationship to Earth and why they ultimately didn't intervene\" in the conflict against Thanos.  \nIn October 2021, Lexus released a commercial promoting the film and its Lexus IS 500 sports sedan starring Nanjiani as Kingo, with frequent MCU directors Joe and Anthony Russo guiding its development and Framestore working on the visual effects. Lexus created ten concept cars based on the ten Eternals characters from the film. The LS 500h and NX are featured in the film. Beginning on November 20, 2021, select costumes from the film were part of the Futures exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's Arts and Industries Building, which ran through July 2022. Behind-the-scenes content looking at the evolution of the film's visuals as well as an augmented reality experience were also included in the exhibit.\n\n## Release  \n### Theatrical  \nEternals had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021, and was screened at the Rome Film Festival on October 24. The film was released theatrically in many European countries on November 3, and in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 5 in RealD 3D and 4DX. In September 2021, Disney announced that the film would have an exclusive theatrical release for a minimum of 45 days. Eternals was previously set for release on November 6, 2020, before it was shifted to February 12, 2021, and then to the November 2021 date, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.  \n#### Censorship  \nIn May 2021, a Chinese state media report excluded Eternals, as well as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, from its list of upcoming MCU films releasing, which Variety noted \"added to rumors\" that the films would not be released in China, especially since Zhao had become \"an unexpected persona non grata\" in the country after she was scrutinized by Chinese netizens over her remarks in a 2013 interview with Filmmaker magazine in which she described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\". By September 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported it remained \"an open question\" if the Chinese government or Zhao would attempt to \"rehabilitate\" the situation, but it \"seems likely\" the film would not be released in China following the country's response to Nomadland as well as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings likely not being released in the country either following backlash to comments made by star Simu Liu in 2017.  \nThe film was not released in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman due to the depiction of a gay couple. Theaters in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt were set to show an edited version of the film which is missing all the love scenes.  Angelina Jolie criticized the countries' decision to ban the film, saying: \"I'm sad for those audiences. And I'm proud of Marvel for refusing to cut those scenes out. I still don't understand how we live in a world today where there's still people who would not see the family Phastos has and the beauty of that relationship and that love. How anybody is angry about it, threatened by it, doesn't approve or appreciate it is ignorant.\" Lebanese actor Haaz Sleiman, who played Phastos' husband Ben in the film, also voiced the same reaction towards the matter: \"They stood their ground and said, 'Nope, we are not going to compromise the integrity of our film.' It made these Arab countries looks so ignorant and pathetic. I have no respect for those governments. They have displayed to the world that they are not only a disgrace to humanity, but to God. Hopefully this will inspire the Saudi people, the Kuwaiti people and the people in Qatar to fight back.\" Marvel later agreed to cut any kind of love scenes, including the gay couple kiss for the film's release in Indonesia, which received praise by the Indonesian Film Censorship Board (LSF).  \n### Home media  \nEternals began streaming on Disney+ on January 12, 2022, with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version. Audio commentary and additional bonus features for the film were added to Disney+ in March 2022. It was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 15. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.  \nAccording to Samba TV, Eternals was watched by 2 million U.S. households during its first five days on Disney+. Eternals was also the top streaming film for viewers in the United States for the week ending January 16, 2022, according to Whip Media's TV Time.  \n## Reception  \n### Box office  \nEternals grossed $164.9million in the United States and Canada, and $237.2million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $402.1million. The film's opening weekend earned $162 million globally, which was the second-largest worldwide opening weekend in the COVID-19 pandemic for a Hollywood film, of which IMAX contributed to over $13.6 million.  \n#### Pre-sale tickets and projections  \nAdvanced ticket sales for Eternals were estimated to be $2.6 million in its first 24 hours, outpacing those for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings ($1.4 million) and Black Widow ($2 million) during the same time frame, while AMC Theatres had the largest first day sales of 2021 for the film. In November, Fandango reported that pre-sales for Eternals were second-largest of 2021, behind Black Widow. In October, Boxoffice Pro initially projected that the film would earn $82\u2013102 million within its opening weekend, and around $210\u2013280 million in total domestic box office. At the end of the month, Boxoffice Pro modified their projections to $67\u201392 million for the film's opening weekend, and around $165\u2013215 million in total domestic box office, due to mixed early critical reception. According to Deadline Hollywood, Eternals was expected to earn $75 million within its domestic opening weekend, and around $150 million globally.  \n#### Performance  \nIn the United States and Canada, Eternals earned $30.7 million in its opening day, which included $9.5 million from Thursday night previews, marking the third-largest opening day of the pandemic, behind Black Widow and Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Its opening weekend earned $71.3 million from 5.5 million theater admissions, making it the top film of the weekend. IMAX accounted for over $7.6 million of the weekend. This marked the fourth-largest opening weekend of the pandemic. The domestic opening weekend gross was lower than various pre-release projections. Deadline attributed this to the film's overall mixed reception from critics and audiences. In its second weekend, Eternals remained the top film, grossing over $27.5 million. Eternals became the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2021 in the United States.  \nOutside of North America, Eternals earned over $90.7 million within its opening weekend from 46 markets. It was number-one in nearly all of these markets. The international opening weekend gross had exceeded various pre-release projections. IMAX contributed to $6 million of the opening gross, from 58 countries. The film scored the largest opening of the pandemic in Italy, Brazil, and Hong Kong. In South Korea, Eternals earned $14.4 million, marking the largest debut for a Hollywood film amid the pandemic. In Russia, the film earned an opening of $5.4 million through six days. In its second weekend, Eternals earned $48 million from 49 markets, a drop of 49%. It remained number one in many of these territories. The following weekend, the film earned $22.7 million. It was the top film of the weekend internationally, remaining the top film in many territories, including all markets across Latin America, except for Mexico. As of November 28, 2021, the film's largest markets were South Korea ($26.4 million), the United Kingdom ($18.7 million), France ($14.9 million), Mexico ($14.3 million), and Brazil ($11.1 million).  \n### Critical response  \nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of score based on count reviews, with an average rating of average. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An ambitious superhero epic that soars as often as it strains, Eternals takes the MCU in intriguing\u2014and occasionally confounding\u2014new directions.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Upon release, it became the lowest-rated MCU film on both websites and the first installment to be classified as \"rotten\" on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest grade for an MCU film, and PostTrak reported 78% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.  \nCharlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard described the film as \"lavish\" and \"ambitious\", and praised the fight sequences as \"astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail\". Robert Abele of TheWrap commended the cinematography and felt \"an earnestness to the operatic stakes\". Oliver Jones of the Observer called it \"full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own\". Owen Gleiberman was disappointed over Zhao's missing filmmaking style that shaped her films The Rider (2017) and Nomadland (2020) to \"embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking\", but felt that the film was a \"squarely fun and gratifying watch\". Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times thought \"it's got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it's desperately in need of a bit more wit ... what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren't just zippy but often delicately elegant\".  \nLinda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle described it as \"a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances\"; Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture called Zhao's direction \"workmanlike\"; and Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent said that it \"strives for the same expansive soulfulness\" as Nomadland \"but discovers there's room enough only for the occasional burst of it\". Brian Truitt of USA Today praised Zhao's \"penchant for naturalistic environments\", but wrote that the narrative \"struggles to juggle its many subplots and tries to do too much\". Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press criticized the dialogue and fight scenes, but praised the visual effects and Nanjiani's performance. Shirley Li of The Atlantic felt that \"Zhao's delicate examination of her characters outshines Eternals duller and more convoluted moments\".  \nRobbie Collin wrote the film was \"constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit\"; Kevin Maher felt \"a strange self-sabotaging energy at the heart\"; and Steve Rose of The Guardian missed \"the breezy wit of Marvel's best movies ... like coming into Avengers: Endgame cold without having seen any of the preceding installments\". K. Austin Collins of Rolling Stone felt that the film was \"good at telling us where to look, at impressing us with its manufactured sense of grandeur\", but lacked \"any credible sense of what's actually worth seeing\". Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times had a \"depressing realization that you've just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chlo\u00e9 Zhao will ever make\". Brian Lowry of CNN thought \"the movie's structural flaws offset its stunning visuals and strong performances\". Kyle Smith of National Review was harsher, describing it as \"one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most trite, and least human\" of the MCU films.  \nThe mixed reception surprised some commentators, given the MCU's positive track record and the acclaim of Zhao's previous work. Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"much of the criticism of Kirby's work\", which was divisive for its subject matter and relationship to the wider Marvel Universe, \"has followed Zhao in her adaptation.\" He compared the divisive response to that of Zack Snyder's DC Extended Universe films Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), writing that they and Eternals share \"a deconstructive approach to superheroes and force them to question their purpose in the world, through meditative and melancholy narrative beats, and a tragic yet hopeful ending.\" This approach, he felt, subverted critics and audiences' expectations, which made them review the film more harshly. Zhao addressed some of the criticisms of the film, believing some of the divisiveness came from everyone \"having an existential crisis\" because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the film being an \"existential crisis, both for humanity and God\". She also felt the reactions to how the film incorporated her filmmaking sensibilities with Marvel's were \"a testament to how much we had merged with each other; how uncomfortable that might make people feel\".  \n### Accolades  \nThe film was given the Seal of Authentic Representation from the Ruderman Family Foundation for Ridloff's role as Makkari. The seal is given to films and series that feature actors with disabilities who have at least five lines of dialogue. Eternals was also one of 28 films that received the ReFrame Stamp for 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame for films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.  \n## Documentary special  \nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The special on this film, Assembled: The Making of Eternals, was released on Disney+ on February 16, 2022.  \n## Future  \nIn October 2021, Zhao said she was open to making a sequel. The next month, Kaz and Ryan Firpo expressed interest in making a prequel series for Disney+ that would focus on one Eternal in a different time period each episode, such as an episode about Thena in Ancient Greece and one about Kingo in 1890s Mumbai where he balances his life as a film star with Mahatma Gandhi's campaign for India's independence from British rule. They also felt there were opportunities to continue the film's story by further exploring Dane Whitman and showing the Eternals confronting the Celestials. Chan said in January 2022 that she would reprise the role of Sersi in the future. Feige was asked about Styles's future in the MCU that July and said Marvel Studios was excited to further explore the characters Eros and Pip as part of the MCU's more cosmic stories. A month later, Oswalt said a sequel had been confirmed by Marvel Studios and Zhao was returning to direct. In October, Moore said Marvel intended to bring back the Eternals characters in the future of the MCU. Nanjiani said the following month that he was unaware of a sequel and believed Oswalt was mistaken, but expressed interest in reprising his role as Kingo. Don Lee's talent agency indicated in December that he would reprise his role as Gilgamesh in an Eternals sequel. Oswalt clarified his statements in February 2023, saying a sequel was not in development at that time and that he had been misled.\n\nQuestion: Which character from the film \"Eternals\" has the ability to move at superhuman speed and is also noted as the first deaf superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nVettuvan Koil in Kalugumalai, Pandyan architecture, 8th century CEThe Pandyan empire is believed to have first emerged circa 600 BC and was one of the leading Tamil dynasties of Southern India. There were various forms of art and many architectural communities within the empire, and their work was sold to overseas markets. Rock cutting and structural temples are examples of these, playing a significant role in Pandyan culture. The rock carvings typically depicted religious figures, floral motifs and animals and were made to surround temples and shrines.\nThe vimana, gopuram and mandapa are some of the predominant features of the early Pandyan temples. Groups of small temples are seen at the Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu. In the later stages of Pandyan rule, finely sculptured idols, gopurams and vimanas were developed. Gopurams are the rectangular entrance and portals of the temples.  \nOther integral art forms of these Pandyan communities were the paintings, poetry, music and punch-marked coins, each with symbols and transcriptions holding meaning to society.\n\n## History  \n<ImageHere>Four-armed Vishnu, Pandya Dynasty, 8th\u20139th century CE.The Pandyan kingdom was one of the three major empires of the Tamil dynasty in Tamil Nadu, India. Pandya, meaning 'big' or 'strong', is the oldest of these empires, prevailing for what is estimated to be four to five centuries. Despite some uncertainty around the structure of these Tamil empires, the history becomes clearer after the beginning of the common era. This became a period of extensive travel and trade between these Tamil speaking kingdoms and between Tamil Nadu and other countries. There is mention of the Pandyan kings in both Greek and Roman history which reflects this ancient international trade relationship. Madurai was the capital city of early the Pandyan kingdom and was the heart of notable temple architecture during this period.\n\n\n## Artisan communities  \nThe Pandya's were known for their unique art forms that differed from the other kingdoms of Tamil Nadu. There were various communities each providing different crafts fundamental to Pandyan culture. It is evident that the empire held a significant influence over art across all of Southern India.  \nThe primary artisan groups formed an association referred to as the Kammalar, composed of a goldsmith, brass smith, blacksmith, carpenter and mason. Their work in Pandya was culturally important across all of Tamil Nadu as well as being important to trade in the overseas market.  \nAnother notable example of key artisanal communities in Pandya were the sculptors and stonemasons. The stonemasons carved cave temples made of granite rock, influenced by the head of gods central to their religion. The rock sculptures had a distinctive style that included wide chests and shoulders, and long faces that contrasted the petite hips and soft features. An example of these key stone carvings is seen at the entrance of a cave temple at Pillaiyarpatti. The inscription under the sculpture refers to the carving as \u2018De\u015bivin\u0101yagar\u2019, a figure still worshiped in the area today.  \nJewellery was another art form practiced by the craftsmen of Pandya. They used gold, stones and pearls to create various ornaments sold to overseas buyers. The jewellery had images of their gods and symbols that represented their gods engraved into the gold. Pieces from the Pandyan period have been found with floral engravings and inscriptions dedicated to the God Tirumalai Suvadigal on the surface.  \n## Coin styles  \nThe art of coin making in the Pandyan dynasty used punch-marking methods, which was a type of early Indian coinage known for its unique symbols and irregular shapes. They ranged in colours from gold, silver and copper, depending on the political influence of the time. Some of the earliest coins were square shaped and were marked with elephant symbols on one side. In later periods the coins were marked with fish, heraldic symbols, and various emblems. The fish that are seen on Pandyan coins are the same as those notable on the national Pandyan flag, which includes a double fish emblem. Other coin styles depict a Chola influence as they contain a tiger motif, and human figures. The kammatasor were the workers responsible for minting these various coins in the Tamil country.  \n## Paintings  \nMurals of the Sittannavasal Jain Temple, dating back to 7th century CEThe rule of both the Pandya's and the Cholas is referred to as the \u2018golden period\u2019 of art and culture in the ancient cities of Tamil Nadu. The paintings of the Pandyan dynasty share similarities to that of Buddhist and Hindu art found in the Brihadeesvara temple. Common motifs seen in Pandyan paintings include animals, royal figures, floral patterns and lotus leaves. Sittannavasal is a Jain temple originating under Pandyan ruling which is home to some of the only Pandyan paintings left in the world. It is famous for its mural paintings covering the walls and roof of the cave. The Sittannavasal paintings contain varied colour schemes, using black pigments from soot, green from Terre verre, red and yellow from ochre and blue from ultramarine. These elaborate colour schemes contrast the typically monochrome, red ochre paintings of other southern Indian dynasties. However, many of these Pandyan paintings in the Sittannavasal temple have been vandalised and are poorly visible in the modern day. Other cave paintings dating to the 9th century include motives of fish, ducks and people dancing.  \n## Poetry and Music  \nThere is evidence of both occupational poets, that recounted on the affairs of the king as a profession as well as those who pursued poetry as a hobby . Sangam poetry, which derived from Pandya, Chola and Chera influence narrated the distinction between love and war and the power of the human experience. Other poetry of the empire reflect a sarcastic and sophisticated take on everyday life in the Pandyan village.  \nAttruppadai is a genre of ancient Indian poetry whereby one minstrel addresses another. Madurai-Kanchi is a poem written in the Attruppadai genre, admiring Nedunchezian, the Pandyan King.  \nMany of the kings themselves, were poets and literacy experts that wrote extensively.  \nMusic attributed to the Pandyan period was derived from the poetry and was created by bands of both male and female singers and dancers. Traditionally these long poems were publicly played to music by thirteen musicians, with a variety of instruments. Professional musicians would also chant the melodic poetry outside temples.  \n## Dance  \nThe Pandya's, along with other dynasties of the Tamil Nadu district also participated in various traditional dances. The Deverattam, translating to the god or king dance in Tamil language, was one particularly performed by the Pandyan dynasty. It was generally danced by the kings and fighters after a successful battle against other Indian dynasties. It was a dance of joy and a symbol of hope for the following battles.  \n## Pandyan architecture  \nThe Pandyan dynasty had their own unique temple style that followed on from the chola style temples between 1000 and 1250 AD. The architectural features of Pandyan temples reflected the kingdoms wealth and social position in respect to other dynasties of southern India at the time. They were mostly stone buildings with distinctive qualities such as rectangular ground floors leading into pyramidal floors higher up with gilded roofs above. Surrounding the temples there were various important Hindu mythological figures sculpted into the rock and various animals carved into the pillars.  \nKey features of Pandyan architecture include the vimanas, mandapas, and the gopuras. The vimana is the structure above and around the main shrine and is the area where the deities are present. The vimana can be single or multi storied, depending on how many deities the temple contains. The mandapa is a pillared hallway or room that ancient Indian dynasties used for religious dancing, music and ceremonies. Larger temples can have more than one mandapa placed to the sides of the main structures. The gopura is another predominant feature of Pandyan architecture and it is the entranceway into the temple. It is a storied structure commonly made of stone, and there can be multiple built around the sides of the temple.  \nDravidian style architecture is commonly seen throughout Pandyan temples and it is a southern Indian architectural style. The predominant features of Dravidian architecture are the main tower, referred to as the vimana, and the entrance gateway referred to as the gopuram. The vimana is notable in Dravidian architecture as it is structured as a tiered pyramid that rises up to the sky. This is different to the main tower structures in northern India, which curve up to a point.  \nThere are few standing architectural monuments left from Pandyan ruling and no temples surviving in Madurai, Pandya's capital, preceding the sixteenth century. The temples that do remain, depict the notable features attributed to the rule of the Pandyan kings.  \n### Kalugumalai Temple complex (768\u2013800 CE)  \nKalugumalai is a region of the Pandyan dynasty, home to the Kalugumalai Murugan temple. The Kalugumalai temple complex is designed in Dravidian style and comprises a Gopuram and a Vimana. The entranceway into the Kalugumalai depicts stone cut elephants, creditable to early Pandya's and the exterior of the temple is lined with inscriptions narrating stories of the Lord of the Pandyan empire.  \n* Kalugumalai Jain Beds  \n* Kalugasalamoorthy Temple  \n### Kunnakudi temple  \nKunnakudi Shanmughanathar temple(also called Kundrakudi Temple or Kunnakudi Murugan Temple) in Kundrakudi, a village in the outskirts of Karaikudi in Sivaganga district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Shaivate god Murugan. Constructed in the Pandyan art and architecture, the temple is located in the Tirupattur \u2013 Karaikudi Road, around abbr=on from Karaikudi. There are three caves located on the western side of the lower rock, that has rock-cut shrines from the Pandyan Empire from the 8th century. The caves have the earliest sculptural representation of Dvarapalas, the guardian deities, for any South Indian temple.The temple has a five-tiered gateway tower, the gopuram in the hill, leading to a pillared hall and the sanctum.  \n### Vettuvan koil  \nVettuvan koil is a temple structure carved into the side of a rocky cliff that can be attributed to the Pandyas circa 8th century ACE. Although unfinished, the temple displays a rectangular front area with a square vimana bordered by realistic rock-cut sculptures of flowers and Jain figures. The carvings are separated into various levels that reflect the bas-relief art form significant to Pandyan communities. Vettuvan koil is Tamil for 'heaven of sculptures' and it was carved under rule of Pandyan King, Parantakan Nedunjadaiyan. It is bordered by pavement and has the shikhara (rising peak of the temple) coming out directly from the canopy. It is architecturally notable for its intricate shrine carved in the middle that has sculptures seated around the border. These sculptures are unique as they do not reflect the typical position of ancient south Indian and Pandyan figures. Usually, figures are sculpted in a front-on position, however the sculptures of Vettuvan koil are seated, unlike others throughout India.  \n### \u0100\u0146aimalai  \n\u0100\u0146aimalai is a district of south India that is home to key landmarks of Pandyan architecture. A rock cut temple cave, referred to in modern times as the Narasinga-perumal temple is located here. It is a stone temple with two pillars cut out and a shrine in the centre. Just near to this is another rock cut temple with architectural features similar to that of the Pallava kingdom. It has a lotus engraving on the front pillars and four rock sculptures dedicated to Hindu deity, Vishnu.  \n### Tirunelveli Nellaiappar temple  \nNellaiappar temple is a large rock-cut style temple with five gopurams, notable for the aesthetic features carved into the roof and pillars. The foundations of the temple were built by Pandyan society, and the temple was continually added to by following dynasties. A key feature of the Nellaiappar temple are the 161 musical pillars, which when struck make a different musical note. The Nellaiappar temple was also home to Pandyan paintings of the time, including paintings of lotuses and other floral motifs.  \n* Nellaiappar Temple  \n### Others  \n* Meenakshi Amman Temple  \n* Sittanavasal Cave \u2013 Rock cut cave and Paintings from 9th century Pandyan period  \n* Srivilliputhur Andal temple  \n* Ranganathaswamy Temple  \n<ImageHere>Kalugumalai Jain Beds, Pandyan Empire, King Parantaka Nedunjadaiya (768\u2013800 CE)Art of the Pandyan Dynasty\n\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following images depicts a structure that was primarily used for religious purposes during the Pandyan Empire?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\n<ImageHere>Siti Nurhaliza, dubbed as the Malaysian pop princess\nIn 1991, Dato Zainal Abidin \u2013 who was a member of the rock act Headwind \u2013 released a self-titled solo album, incorporating elements of world music (even including influences such as Paul Simon's album Graceland), plus lyrics that carried social and environmental commentaries. The album became critically and commercially acclaimed, its songs considered a refreshing break from the contemporary melancholic rock ballads that were prevalent at the time.  \nLocal rap and hip-hop also began to flourish with the success of 7-man group 4U2C in the mid-1990s, receiving several gold and platinum wins while three-brother group KRU, wrote numerous rap and hip-hop numbers.  \nIt was also during this decade too that there was fierce competition among pop singers to get their songs to the top of their charts; such as  Aris Ariwatan, Fauziah Latiff, Aishah, Hattan, Awie, Ziana Zain, Ning Baizura, Ella, Amy Mastura and Sheila Majid along pop bands like Slam, Ukays and Spring. Aishah and Rahim Maarof was the most popular artist from 1990 to 1992, followed by Jamal, Ella and Fauziah Latiff (1993), M. Nasir, Ukays, and Amy Mastura (1994) and Awie, Aris and Ziana Zain (1995) and Slam and KRU (1996).  \nMid 1990s marked the era when pop music with traditional elements like dangdut and Malay ethnic shake the market with best-selling albums from singers like Iwan, Amelina, Mas Idayu, Noraniza Idris, To'ki and M. Nasir. With contemporary touch, these singers managed to uplift Malay traditional music to another level.  \nIn 1996, a schoolgirl by the name of Siti Nurhaliza from the rural town of Kuala Lipis, Pahang released an album produced by talented producer Adnan Abu Hassan. This album of pop melayu genre was a huge success. She incorporated different genres such as Malay pop, R&B and Malay traditional music in her later albums with much success, eventually becoming Malaysia's most popular singer.  \nThere was also the breakthrough of the nasyid genre into the mainstream market between mid-1990s until the early 2000s. The genre, which uses only vocals and percussion music developed by vocal groups like Raihan, Rabbani and Brothers, gathered a lot of support from the rural and the religious Muslim demographics.\n\n### The 2000s and present: influence of reality TV and the internet  \n<ImageHere>Yuna performing.\n2000s started with a movement towards progressive pop composition. Post Siti Nurhaliza, several female singers making huge waves with chart topping-award-winning hits such as Liza Hanim, Dayang Nurfaizah and Misha Omar. These singers who rose from singing competition organized by Radio Televisyen Malaysia in the late 90s and early 2000s and discovered by music maestro Adnan Abu Hassan managed to sustain a long lasting career in the next decades alongside Siti. Whereas male pop artist Anuar Zain started his adult singing career in the late 90s and became popular with R&B Pop in the early decade and remain popular ever since. This is also another era for R&B boy band after first batch in the late 90s started with Innuendo, Indigo and Option 1 to the later like Ruffedge, VE and Phyne Ballerz.  \nPopularity of pop rock band in the 2000s also proved that Malaysian music becoming more progressive. Among notable pop rock artiste with high-selling albums during this era like Exists, Spider, OAG, Flop Poppy, Butterfingers, Def Gab C, Pretty Ugly, Ezlynn, Elyana and pop duo like Ajai & Nurul making another alternate wavelength to cater new listeners.  \nDuring the mid-2000s, the introduction to the reality television concept revived public interest in music entertainment. Shows such as Akademi Fantasia and Malaysian Idol allowed the public to choose their own stars by sending SMS through hand phones at the audience's convenience. This excited the public because they were involved in the making of a celebrity and could choose who they wanted instead of relying on record companies for the production and distribution. The winners of these singing competitions tend to be seasonal fads; releasing chart-topping debuts but are later relegated into obscurity (though there are exceptions like Jaclyn Victor, Mawi, Stacy Anam, Aizat Amdan, Akim Ahmad and Hafiz Suip), earning them the moniker Artis Mee Segera (\"instant noodle artists\"). Comparing from the past decades, pay TVs and Internet have affected the musical taste of young listeners that prefers foreign music. Several reality TV stars like Akim Ahmad had long journey to get noticed in the local music scene only after reformed a pop rock band The Majistret with  personnels from fellow band members.  \nIn the late 2000s, unsigned Malaysian artists who rose to fame on YouTube and indie music bands such as Hujan, Gerhana Skacinta and Bunkface changed the Malaysian music scene. However, this does not represent the active live music circuit by singer-songwriter performers in pubs and cafes. Yunalis Zarai, a former caf\u00e9 singer pioneered the acoustic singer-songwriter trend, leading the way for record labels to debut similar acts. YouTube changed the Malaysian musical landscape in the 2010s. Instead of SMS votes, music lovers gave birth to YouTube stars by the number of views, that crossover into the mainstream such as Najwa Latif, Elizabeth Tan, Sufian Suhaimi and Khai Bahar.  \nYouTube also helped expose unknown foreign music genres such as J-pop and K-pop to the Malaysian audience. The latter's particular worldwide success influenced record companies to try repackage the successful Malaysian boy band and Girl Group formula from the 90s such as KRU, Feminin or 4U2C and bring it to the 2010s. Current active groups are All Star Jefri, Dynda, V.I.P, Max 24:7, Gula-Gula, Forteen, P.O.P and TIGA. KRU from the 90s was active until 2018.  \nIn the 2010s, second generation of reality TV and singing competition stars continue to conquer pop music such as Syamel, Hael Husaini, Ernie Zakri, Ara Johari and Nabila Razali.  The movement to shift Malaysian music to adapt back the 1990s formula was initiated by local labels like Aries Music, FMC and Music Valley started with Aiman Tino, Sufian Suhaimi and Projector Band (2016) as well as Wany Hasrita, Haqiem Rusli and Floor 88 (2017). Dangdut music make another quake in 2010s when Malaysia send delegations of young singers to join Dangdut Akademi Asia from 2015- 2019. With the late Pak Ngah as the judge and Mas Idayu as commentator, Malaysia managed to introduce new dangdut sensation into Indonesian massive markets with names like Shiha Zikir, Syura Badron and Baby Shima Megat got record deals with Indonesian labels. By late 2010s, dangdut music with Malay pop-rock element becoming one of the best selling music in Malaysia.  \nApart from that dance pop and hip hop music rise again when big names like Malique, Joe Flizzow, Altimet and Omar K continue recruit and produce progressive music for new wave of hip hop artiste like Sonaone (2014), Defam, Aman Ra (2016) and Yonnyboi, K-Clique, Kid Santhe (2019) as well as popstars like Nanasheme (2015), Ismail Izzani, As'ad Motawh (2017) and Andi Bernadee, Naim Daniel (2018).\n\n## Challenges  \nBy the late 1990s with the Internet increasing user base, downloading mp3 files through Napster was rampant. Unlicensed CDs were sold in fly-by-night shops and illegal CD hawkers at night markets. Priced at 1/4 of the original price, legal CD albums were no match for these outlets.  \nThere are many factors that have caused the Malaysian music industry to decline:  \n* Excessive copying (copyright infringement is not a new phenomenon in Malaysian music market, it has been a phenomenon since the 1970s, with bootlegged vinyls and audio cassettes selling at the half of the price of the original product)  \n* The revenue for Malaysian music industry decreased from over RM300 million in 1997 to only RM60 million in 2009  \n* Many local record labels out of business  \n* Illegal downloads  \n* The price of original cassettes and CDs decreased  \n* The number of local artists active in the music industry dropped from over 200 in 1997 to less than 100 in 2009  \n* Local record labels has forced local artists to produce album themselves  \n* Many local albums released after 2006 have less songs (mostly 5 \u2013 9 songs)  \nAs a result, Malaysia along with its neighboring country Singapore are countries in South East Asia where illegal music copies outsells legal ones. Sales of domestic and international repertoire are in the same levels in both countries compared to other South East Asian nations.  \nThe unauthorized distributing of music CDs has caused all original albums sold in Malaysia, whether local or foreign to be attached with an original hologram sticker since 2000 before it can be sold. At the time of introduction, it only covers audio CDs, cassettes and music VCDs. In 2003, the sticker was updated with hologram feature and now also covers non-music video releases and video games. Also, in 2004, the certification levels were down from 15,000 copies and 25,000 copies to 10,000 copies and 20,000 copies for an album to be certified as Gold and Platinum, respectively.  \nThe encouragement from the Malaysian government towards privatization of broadcasting stations received support from the public. An array of new radio and TV stations were built. Legal ringtone downloads were an unexpected success to music companies. A music single ringtone downloaded 100,000 times are commonplace.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following artists became known as Malaysia's most popular singer, incorporating a variety of genres such as Malay pop, R&B, and Malay traditional music in their work?\nChoice list: \nA.

The hymn's lyrics were written in 1908 by Lucy Maud Montgomery, with music written by Lawrence W. Watson. It was performed for the first time in public on May 22, 1908. The manuscript music, dated October 27, 1908, and correspondence relating to it are displayed at Green Gables House, Cavendish. The Island Hymn was adopted as the provincial anthem by the legislative assembly on May 7, 2010. The Provincial Anthem Act includes a French version of the Island Hymn, adapted by Raymond J. Arsenault of Abram-Village and called L'hymne de l'\u00cele.  \n\"Ode to Newfoundland\" is the official provincial anthem of Newfoundland and Labrador. Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle composed it in 1902 as a four-verse poem entitled Newfoundland. It was set to the music of British composer Sir Hubert Parry, a personal friend of Boyle, who composed two settings. On May 20, 1904, it was chosen as Newfoundland's official national anthem (national being understood as a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire on par with Canada). This distinction was dropped when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. Three decades later, in 1980, the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem.  \n\"A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow (Ontari-ari-ari-o!)\" is an unofficial anthem of Ontario. The song was written by Dolores Claman, with English lyrics by Richard Morris, French lyrics by Larry Trudel, and orchestrations by Jerry Toth. It was commissioned by the Progressive Conservative government of John Robarts as the signature tune for a movie of the same name that was featured at the Ontario pavilion at Expo 67, the World's Fair held in Montreal, Quebec, in Canada's Centennial year. It was used again in the Ontario's segment of the short film A Place to Stand, which won the 1967 Academy Award for Live Action Short Film.\n<ImageHere>George-\u00c9tienne Cartier ca. 1871\n\"\u00d4 Canada! mon pays, mes amours\" is a French-Canadian song, written by George-\u00c9tienne Cartier first sung in 1834, during a patriotic banquet of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society held in Montreal. The words were first published in the June 29, 1835, edition of La Minerve and its music in Le Chansonnier des coll\u00e8ges in 1850; it is uncertain when the lyrics and music were put together, probably by Ernest Gagnon sometime between 1850 and 1868. The music currently used was composed by Jean-Baptiste Labelle.  \n\"Gens du pays\" has been called the unofficial national anthem of Quebec. Written by poet, songwriter, and avowed Quebec nationalist Gilles Vigneault (with music co-written by Gaston Rochon), it was first performed by Vigneault on June 24, 1975, during a concert on Montreal's Mount Royal at that year's F\u00eate nationale du Qu\u00e9bec ceremony. It quickly became a folk classic, and it has been played frequently at F\u00eate nationale ceremonies since then. The chorus is by far the most famous part of the song: Gens du pays, c'est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d'amour, which, translated, says, \"Folks of the land, it is your turn to let yourselves talk of love.\" At this time, Vigneault invited Quebecers to use this song when someone celebrate a birthday, changing \"Gens du pays\" by \"Mon cher (name)...\". In many families, this song can be heard when the cake approaches.\n\n## Early patriotic songs  \n\"The Bold Canadian\", also known as \"Come all ye bold Canadians\", is a Canadian patriotic song that originated during the War of 1812. The lyrics celebrate the Canadian conquest of Detroit in the Michigan Territory. It is believed that the song was written by a private from the Third York Militia's First Flank Company named Cornelius Flummerfelt. Until 1907, the song was only passed on in oral traditions, with a few different versions gaining popularity. Full versions of the song were not published until 1927 when the Ontario Historical Society published two different versions of the song. A third version was published in 1960. All three varied, with different stanzas and order of stanzas.  \n\"The Maple Leaf Forever\" is an older but unofficial national anthem written by Alexander Muir in 1867. It was in consideration for official national anthem; however, as no French version was ever written, it was never popular with Francophones.  \nLa feuille d'\u00e9rable (the maple leaf) is a patriotic French-Canadian song written by Albert Viau for a song book named  La bonne chanson. The maple leaf being, originally, a symbol of the French-Canadians adopted in 1834 by the St-Jean Baptiste Society. It is also used even today as a pre-game anthem in Theatrical Improvisation leagues across Qu\u00e9bec.  \n## Popular patriotic songs  \n\"Canada\", also known as \"Ca-na-da\", \"The Centennial Song\", or \"Une chanson du centenaire\" in French, was written by Bobby Gimby in 1967 to celebrate Canada's centennial and Expo 67. It was commissioned by the Centennial Commission (a special Federal Government agency), and written in both of Canada's official languages, English and French. The song's recording was performed by the Young Canada Singers, two groups of children \u2013 one that sang the French lyrics, led by Montreal conductor Raymond Berthiaume, and another that sang in English, under conductor Laurie Bower in Toronto. The musical score was composed by Ben McPeek. The single went on to be the most successful single in Canada in 1967, selling a then unprecedented 270,000 copies. It was No. 1 for 2 weeks on the RPM Top 100 Singles in Canada in April 1967.  \n<ImageHere>Gordon Lightfoot ca. 2008\n\"Something to Sing About\" is a patriotic song written by folk singer Oscar Brand in 1963 that sings the praises of the many different regions of Canada. It was used as the theme for Let's Sing Out, a folk music show that aired on CTV and CBC and was the theme song for the Canadian pavilion at Expo 67, and there was once a movement for it to chosen as Canada's national anthem in 1965.  \n\"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" is a song by Gordon Lightfoot that describes the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This song was commissioned by the CBC for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967, to start Canada's Centennial year. It appeared on Lightfoot's The Way I Feel album later in the same year. Lightfoot re-recorded the track on his 1975 compilation album, Gord's Gold, with full orchestration (arranged by Lee Holdridge). A live version also appears on his 1969 album Sunday Concert. Additionally, the song was covered by John Mellencamp, George Hamilton IV, and James Keelaghan who performed the song on the Lightfoot tribute album, Beautiful. In 2001, Gordon Lightfoot's \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" was honoured as one of the Canadian MasterWorks by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada.  \n\"The Hockey Theme\" is a Canadian theme song written in 1968 by Dolores Claman and orchestrated by Jerry Toth. The theme is popularly associated with Canada's national winter sport: hockey. It gained popularity through associated with CBC Television's Hockey Night in Canada, and T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada's La Soir\u00e9e du hockey from 1968 until 2008. In 2008 the CBC announced that the negotiations to renew their licence or purchase the theme had been unsuccessful and that they would run a national contest to find a new theme song. The rights were then purchased by rival broadcaster CTV in perpetuity. Beginning in the fall of 2008 the theme could be heard on hockey broadcasts on the CTV-owned TSN and RDS sports channels.  \n\"Northwest Passage\" is an a cappella song written by Stan Rogers. The song appears on an album of the same name released by Rogers in 1981, and is considered one of the classic songs in Canadian music history. In the 2005 CBC Radio One series 50 Tracks: The Canadian Version, \"Northwest Passage\" ranked fourth. It was referred to as one of Canada's unofficial anthems by former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson quoted the song both in her first official address and in her speech at the dedication of the new Canadian embassy in Berlin.  \nThe Tragically Hip, a Canadian rock band active from 1984 until the death of lead singer and lyricist Gord Downie in 2017, were among the best-selling Canadian musicians in Canada. A widely noted signature element of the Hip's collective and Downie's solo catalogues was the extent to which they addressed Canadian themes. The Tragically Hip's relationship with patriotism and nationalism was complicated. \"I\u2019m not a nationalist,\" Downie told his biographer Michael Barclay; Downie said this \"firmly,\" Barclay notes. \"I started using Canadian references not just for their own sake, but because I wanted to pick up my birthright, which is this massive country full of stories,\" Downie continued. In the National Post, Dave Kaufman wrote \"Although Downie sings of Canada, his songs are by no means patriotic, or no more than in the way that we're all influenced by where we're from. The band have never been so obvious as to drape themselves in a Canadian flag, but instead, they evoke that shared experience of what it's meant for many of us to grow up in Canada.\" In the Journal of Canadian Studies, political scientist Gregory Millard discussed the paradoxical question of why \"deeply ambiguous and often critical references to Canada sufficed to raise The Hip to an extraordinary status as icons of Canadian nationalism.\" Millard concluded that \"Canada's position as a culturally peripheral nation is the key to explaining the incongruous appropriation of the Hip\u2019s work for nationalist self-celebration.\"\n\n## First Nations patriotic songs  \n\"O Canada\" has been performed in some First Nation languages during the opening of a few national events. During the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, \"O Canada\" was sung in the southern Tutchone language by Yukon native Daniel Tlen. At a National Hockey League (NHL) game in Calgary on February 1, 2007, young Cree singer Akina Shirt became the first person ever to perform \"O Canada\" in the Cree language at such an event.  \n\"Land of the Silver Birch\" is thought of as a Canadian folk song, written first as a poem by Pauline Johnson. It is associated with camping and canoeing. Its subject matter is a romanticized vision of nature and the land from the perspective of an indigenous person, but it remains popular with the non-Aboriginal majority in Canada. The song appears in the Paul Gross film Men with Brooms (2002). The song was partly re-written in 2005 by Canadian folk singer Dickson Reid and released on his debut album, Sugar in the Snow.  \n## Other patriotic songs  \n* \"Farewell to Nova Scotia\" is a popular folk song from Nova Scotia that is a corruption of the 1791 Scottish folk song \"The Soldier's Adieu\", printed in 1803 in a Glasgow newspaper and attributed to Robert Tannahill. When Nova Scotians began to adapt the song is unknown. In the 1930s, folklorist Helen Creighton collected versions of the folk song from different communities along the eastern shore of Nova Scotia. The song had a resurgence when Halifax CBC TV show Singalong Jubilee used Catherine McKinnon's version as the title theme.  \n* \"The Banks of Newfoundland\" was composed by Chief Justice Francis Forbes sometime around 1820, and was adopted as the authorized march of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.  \n* A Canadianized version of Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" was released in 1955 by the folk group the Travellers.  \n* American country musician Lee Greenwood released \"God Bless You Canada\" in 1989, an adaptation of his American patriotic song \"God Bless the USA\"  \n* Stompin' Tom Connors sang about places in Canada, encouraging people in every Canadian province to be proud of their home.\n\nQuestion: Which individual is associated with a song that was once considered for Canada's national anthem?\nChoice list: \nA.

The collapse was due to a late change in design, altering the method in which the rods supporting the walkways were connected to them, and inadvertently doubling the forces on the connection. The failure highlighted the need for good communication between design engineers and contractors, and rigorous checks on designs and especially on contractor-proposed design changes. The failure is a standard case study on engineering courses around the world, and is used to teach the importance of ethics in engineering.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a structure that suffered from structural defects during its construction, leading to a partial collapse?\nChoice list: \nA.

Contested over 267\u00a0laps, it was the eighth race of the 2012 season. Denny Hamlin of Joe Gibbs Racing took his second win of the season, while Martin Truex Jr. finished second and Jimmie Johnson finished third.  \n## Report  \n### Background  \n<ImageHere>Kansas Speedway, the race track where the race was held.\nKansas Speedway is one of ten  intermediate tracks to hold NASCAR races. The standard track at Kansas Speedway is a four-turn D-shaped oval track that is km long. The track's turns are banked at fifteen degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is 10.4 degrees. The back stretch, opposite of the front, is at only five degrees. The racetrack has seats for 82,000 spectators.  \nBefore the race, Greg Biffle led the Drivers' Championship with 273 points, and Matt Kenseth stood in second with 254. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was third in the Drivers' Championship also with 254 points, one ahead of Martin Truex Jr. and five ahead of Kevin Harvick in fourth and fifth. Denny Hamlin with 242 was eight ahead of Tony Stewart, as Jimmie Johnson with 233 points, was eight ahead of Ryan Newman, and fourteen in front of Clint Bowyer. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 48 points, six ahead of Ford. Toyota, with 34 points, was 30 points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third. Brad Keselowski was the race's defending race winner after winning it in 2011.\n\n### Practice and qualifying  \n<ImageHere>A. J. Allmendinger (pictured in 2015) won the pole position, after having the fastest time of 30.683\u00a0seconds.\nTwo practice sessions were held before the race on Friday. The first session lasted 80 minutes long, while the second was 90 minutes long. Kyle Busch was quickest with a time of 31.083 seconds in the first session, over one-tenth of a second faster than Carl Edwards. Kasey Kahne was third, followed by Landon Cassill, Earnhardt Jr., and Newman. Stewart was seventh, still within a second of Kyle Busch's time. In the second practice session, Johnson was fastest with a time of 30.865 seconds, only 0.113 seconds quicker than second-placed Mark Martin. Biffle took third place, ahead of Keselowski, Sam Hornish Jr. and Edwards. Jeff Burton managed to be seventh quickest.  \nForty-six cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three can race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. A. J. Allmendinger clinched his second pole position during his career, with a time of 30.683 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Harvick. Joey Logano qualified third, Hamlin took fourth, and Martin started fifth. Truex Jr., Earnhardt Jr., Bowyer, Kahne, and Hornish Jr. rounded out the first ten positions. The three drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Tim Andrews, Jeff Green and Tony Raines, who had times of 31.820 and 31.846 seconds.\n\n### Race  \nThe race, the eighth in the season, started at 1:16\u00a0p.m. EDT and was televised live in the United States on Fox. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race and overcast skies are expected.  Cole Cochran, of Kansas City Alliance Raceway Ministries, began pre-race ceremonies, by giving the invocation. Next, Jeremy Vitt performed the national anthem, and Victory Junction Gang Camp ambassadors gave the command for drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Logano had to move to the rear of the grid because of changing his engine.  \n## Results  \n### Qualifying  \n### Race results  \n<ImageHere>Denny Hamlin won the race.\n\n\n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nManufacturers' Championship standings  \n* Note: Only the top five positions are included for the driver standings.\n\nQuestion: Which driver won the pole position for the NASCAR race at Kansas Speedway?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 accompanied Major Vojislav Luka\u010devi\u0107 to the London wedding of King Peter II of Yugoslavia (pictured).\nIn mid-February 1944, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 and Luka\u010devi\u0107 accompanied Special Operations Executive (SOE) Colonel Bill Bailey to the coast south of Dubrovnik and were evacuated from Cavtat by a Royal Navy gunboat. They then traveled via Cairo to London, where Luka\u010devi\u0107 represented Mihailovi\u0107 at King Peter's wedding on 20 March 1944. After the British government decided to withdraw support from Mihailovi\u0107, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 and Luka\u010devi\u0107 were not allowed to return to Yugoslavia until arrangements had been made for the British mission to Mihailovi\u0107 headed by Brigadier Charles Armstrong to be safely evacuated from occupied territory.  \nThe two were detained by the British in Bari, Italy, and thoroughly searched by local authorities, who suspected them of a robbery that had occurred in the Yugoslav consulate in Cairo. Most of the money, jewelry and uncensored letters that they were carrying were impounded. The two were flown out of Bari on 30 May, and landed on an airfield at Pranjani northwest of \u010ca\u010dak shortly after. Because their landing at Pranjani coincided with Armstrong's departure, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 and Luka\u010devi\u0107 demanded that Armstrong be held as a hostage until their impounded belongings could be returned from Bari. The Chetnik personnel at the airfield refused to keep Armstrong any further, and he was allowed to depart without incident.  \nLater that month, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 helped organize a Chetnik \"Independent Group of National Resistance\" and wanted to contact British forces who they expected to land in the southern Adriatic coast. On 11 September 1944, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107 warned Chetnik headquarters that Muslims and Croats were joining the Partisans in large numbers and that Chetniks in Bosnia and Herzegovina lacked food and ammunition. They suggested that Mihailovi\u0107 request an Allied occupation of Yugoslavia or risk losing the war both politically and militarily. They assessed that the population had sensed that the Partisans were now supported by the three major Allied Powers, but that the Chetniks had now been abandoned by them. Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 had always urged Mihailovi\u0107 to show restraint in his dealings with the Germans and Italians, and often warned Mihailovi\u0107 that he must never be seen openly cooperating with the occupiers.loc=p. 329, note 17 On 20 October 1944, Partisan and Soviet Red Army troops captured Belgrade from the Germans. Soon after the Chetniks lost Serbia, the centre of their movement. After the breakdown of the Chetnik movement in early 1945, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 was no longer loyal to Mihailovi\u0107.\n\n### Withdrawal and death  \nBa\u0107ovi\u0107 joined \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's forces in their trek towards the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia, alongside Chetnik ideologue Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107, detachments commanded by Ostoji\u0107, and a large number of refugees, totalling around 10,000. This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) Divisions. Earlier, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and Mihailovi\u0107 had argued over the best course of action. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece, but Mihailovi\u0107 had told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king and the establishment of a national government. From the time \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 joined Mihailovi\u0107 in northeastern Bosnia, he was very critical of Mihailovi\u0107's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to the Ljubljana Gap. When Mihailovi\u0107 remained unconvinced, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 decided to move there independently of him, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107's Serbian Volunteer Corps already there to meet him near Biha\u0107 in western Bosnia to assist his movement.  \nIn order to get his group to Biha\u0107, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 made a safe-conduct agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the NDH and with the Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljevi\u0107 who was collaborating with them. The details of the agreement are not known, but it appears that he and his troops were meant to cross the Sava River into Slavonia where they would be aligned with Drljevi\u0107 as the \"Montenegrin National Army\" with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 retaining operational command. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 apparently tried to outsmart them and sent only his sick and wounded across the river, keeping his fit troops south of the river. He began moving his command westwards and, harassed by both the NDH troops and Partisans, reached the Vrbas River. In the Battle of Lijev\u010de Field, north of Banja Luka, the combined Chetnik force was defeated by a strong NDH force which was armed with German-supplied tanks.  \nFollowing this defeat and the defection of one of his sub-units to Drljevi\u0107, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his group towards safety. However, this appears to have been a trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. According to Tomasevich, exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear, but Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, Vasi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107 were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others. According to some sources, on 20 April, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, Vasi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107 were taken to the Stara Gradi\u0161ka prison, near Jasenovac. The Usta\u0161e gathered them in a field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljevi\u0107 and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, Vasi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107 were amongst those selected. They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Usta\u0161e and taken across the Sava River, never to be seen again. It is reported that they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself, or in a marsh in its vicinity. Both the NDH forces and Drljevi\u0107 had reasons for ensnaring the Chetniks led by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed on the Muslim population in Sand\u017eak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljevi\u0107 was opposed to \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljevi\u0107's separatism.\n\nQuestion: Which event is directly associated with the location shown in Image 1?\nChoice list: \nA.

Six months later, on 16 August, the body was dissolved as the United States of Indonesia was transformed into a unitary state, and all its members became members of the newly formed Provisional People's Representative Council (DPRS). pp = 117 \u2013 118 Sartono was again elected speaker of the body on its 19 August leadership vote. p = 140 Sartono was appointed as formateur for the government cabinet on 28 March 1951 following the fall of the Natsir Cabinet, and he attempted to form a coalition government between the PNI and the Masyumi. p = 148 However, his efforts were thwarted due to policy differences between the two parties - namely, on taxation, local government, and the West New Guinea dispute. pp = 177\u2013178  \nThis was made worse by Sartono's unwillingness to become the prime minister or any cabinet minister. pp = 177\u2013178 His failure led to him returning his mandate after less than a month on 18 April. The task was then assigned to Soekiman Wirjosandjojo and Sidik Djojosukarto \u2013 who managed to form the Sukiman Cabinet. pp = 179\u2013180 During the Wilopo Cabinet period, Sartono called for the resignation of Hamengkubuwono IX as Defense Minister in the aftermath of the 17 October affair. Due to the government dysfunction caused by constant tensions between government and opposition parties in the parliament, Sartono went as far as to warn legislators in December 1953 that the parliament may be dissolved if tensions continued to increase. By 1955, the election saw highly divisive campaigning, and Sartono made a public statement asking political parties to \"not forget good manners\" when referring to one another. pp = 283-284\n\n### Later speakership: 1956\u20131960  \n<ImageHere>Official portrait as speaker, 1956\nIn 1956, there were proposals in the parliament to dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesian Union. A draft law was brought up during a 28 February 1956 meeting of the body, and following a vote it was accepted as agenda in the day's meeting. pp = 177 \u2013 179 Sartono, who disagreed with the draft's inclusion, declared his resignation from speakership and walked out of the building, followed by his deputy Arudji Kartawinata and the PNI faction. On 1 March, members of the PNI, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party and the PKI, in addition to some members of the Nahdlatul Ulama submitted their resignations as members of the parliament. pp = 177\u2013179 Still in March, Sartono secured a seat representing Central Java in the new People's Representative Council (DPR) as a result of the 1955 election. p = 83 Members of the body were sworn in on 20 March 1956, with the DPRS being dissolved, and Sartono was again elected as speaker. pp = 189 \u2013 192  \nFollowing the resignation of Mohammad Hatta from his post as vice president (leaving it vacant until 1973), Sartono was legally second in the presidential line of succession, and he conducted presidential duties for three brief periods during his tenure - in December 1957, between 6 January and 21 February 1959, and between 21 April and 2 July 1959. p = 209 On 23 July 1959, following President Sukarno's 1959 Decree, and the return to the 1945 Constitution, Sartono was sworn again as the speaker of the further renewed DPR. p = 222 The DPR was eventually suspended by Sukarno on 24 June 1960 (though it met last on 5 March), ending Sartono's tenure as speaker. p = 239 After the DPR was suspended, Sartono did not take public office for several years. Allegedly, he refused all positions offered to him, though in one occasion he implied to Foreign Minister Subandrio that he would accept an ambassadorship for an African country \u2013 with the condition that Subandrio himself and Mohammad Yamin were both also assigned to similar positions.\n\n## Death and legacy  \nAfter several years of being unemployed, Sartono accepted an offer by Sukarno to serve in the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA), as the body's vice speaker in 1962. Throughout his time in the parliament \u2013 and during his time at DPA \u2013 Sartono pushed with little success laws meant to strengthen the government's financial accountability. American scholar Daniel Lev wrote that Sartono's experience in the body \"was a great disappointment to him\". He eventually resigned from the DPA and left politics entirely in 1967. He died in Jakarta on 15 October 1968, and was buried in Surakarta. According to author and historian, Nyak Wali Alfa Tirta, Sartono was a quiet, but well liked person, by both his opponents and friends. p = 112 The city government of Surakarta, along with the Mangkunegaran family foundation, have campaigned to make Sartono a National Hero of Indonesia.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\nContext:\n# Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery  \nFounded in 1917, the Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery is located two kilometers east of the city of Nieuwpoort in the province of West Flanders (West-Vlaanderen), Belgium. It is on the N367 (Brugse Steenweg), the road which leads from Nieuwpoort to the village of Sint-Joris, near the intersection with Ramscappelle Road (Ramskapellestraat).  \n## Design  \n<ImageHere>Stone of Remembrance\nRamscappelle Road Military Cemetery was designed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, one of three principal architects that had been appointed by the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) to design military cemeteries in France and Belgium, as well as memorials. Lutyens drew up the design for the cemetery on location. Later, a toolhouse, shelter, and south side wall were added to the design by assistant architect George Goldsmith. There is a War Stone, also known as a Stone of Remembrance, on the east side of the graveyard.  \nThis was designed by Lutyens for the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). It generally denotes a war cemetery with at least one thousand graves. Ramscappelle is an exception to this. The biblical phrase \"Their Name Liveth For Evermore\" on the War Stone was selected by author Rudyard Kipling. It is found on Stones of Remembrance around the world. Kipling, a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), also chose the phrase \"Known unto God\" for the gravestones of the unidentified. The Cross of Sacrifice directly opposite the War Stone, on the west side of the graveyard, was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield, also for the commission. It usually indicates a war cemetery with at least fifty burials.\n\n## Interments  \n<ImageHere>Cross of Sacrifice\n\n<ImageHere>East\u2013west axis of cemetery between War Stone and Cross of Sacrifice\nRamscappelle Road Military Cemetery started with Plot 1 in the middle of the graveyard. Most of the interments in Plot 1 were made in July and August 1917. The burial ground was substantially enlarged after the Armistice of November 1918. At that time, the remains of the deceased from the battlefields and a number of smaller cemeteries were brought to Ramscappelle for interment. Those smaller burial grounds included:  \n* Boitshoucke Churchyard  \n* Ghistelles German Cemetery  \n* Middelkerke German Cemetery  \n* Nieuport Military Cemetery  \n* Nieuport-Bains Military Cemeteries  \nCurrently, there are 841 Commonwealth casualties of World War I who are either buried or commemorated in Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery. Of those, 312 are unidentified. Included in that number are 26 special memorials to those initially interred at Nieuport or Nieuport-Bains, and whose graves were destroyed in battle. In addition to the above, 2 unidentified Foreign National burials are present, for a total of 843 graves in the cemetery. There are 529 identified casualties at Ramscappelle. Among those interred in the cemetery are World War I British flying aces Lieutenant Lionel Ashfield and Captain Harold Mellings.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true about the Ramscappelle Road Military Cemetery as depicted in the images?\nChoice list: \nA. The cemetery was designed by a single principal architect from the Imperial War Graves Commission.\nB. The Stone of Remembrance is typically found in war cemeteries with fewer than 100 graves.\nC.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\n<ImageHere>Vitoria-Gasteiz\nVitoria-Gasteiz is the capital of \u00c1lava, the political and administrative centre of the Autonomous Community and the headquarters of the Basque Government. It is renowned for its nature and its environmentalism, thanks to the a large number of pedestrian areas and one of the highest green space indexes per capita in the whole of Europe. On 22 October 2010, the European Commission chose the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz as the European Green Capital 2012. Its biggest urban jewel is its old town, originating from the Middle Ages, which is set on a hill and full of narrow streets with names which bring to mind past trades (Cutler, Blacksmith, Cobbler...). It is almond-shaped and contains small Renaissance palaces and Roman buildings, in addition to shops, pubs and other cultural spaces. This is the location of the church of San Miguel, home to the patron saint, the White Virgin, and Santa Mar\u00eda Cathedral, whose restored works which are open to the public inspired the writer Ken Follett to write his novel World Without End in 2007.  \nBeyond the medieval town, the Ensanche (19th century expansion) is the main shopping area of the city, with large pedestrian areas and spaces such as the Plaza de la Virgen Blanca (White Virgin Square) or the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, arcaded and Neoclassical. In addition to the urban gardens it is worth highlighting the Green Ring, with seven parks (Alegr\u00eda, Armentia, Errekaleor, Olarizu, Salburua, Zabalgana and Zadorra), the result of a plan for the restoration and environmental recovery of the outskirts of the city.\n\n### Rioja Alavesa  \nMarqu\u00e9s de Riscal  \nTwenty centuries ago, the Romans arrived at Rioja Alavesa bringing with them vine plants and forever changing the destiny of the region. Located between the rocky Cantabrian Mountains and the River Ebro, Rioja Alavesa has one of Europe's most deeply rooted wine-producing traditions. You can find countless wineries in Rioja Alavesa. The restoration of many of their facilities has been entrusted to renowned architects, resulting in a curious combination of harvesting tradition and visual modernity. The main exponents of this architectural revolution are the Ysios winery, by Santiago Calatrava; the Marqu\u00e9s de Riscal winery, by Frank Gehry; the Vi\u00f1a Real winery, by Philippe Mazieres and the Baigorri winery, by I\u00f1aki Aspiazu. The wine produced in Rioja Alavesa is complemented by many other wineries of all shapes and sizes, ranging from those managed as small businesses to those which are a family tradition. Most of them offer the opportunity to go on a guided tour, to discover their facilities and learn about wine production. Rioja Alavesa also has Megalithic sites and monuments. The land neighbouring the Cantabrian Mountains conceals one of the largest concentrations of dolmens in the Basque Country. Proof of this is the narrow spine which starts off near Meano, in the East, and which weaves its way up to Leza, several kilometres to the west. These are the monolithic monuments of El Sotillo, San Mart\u00edn, Los Llanos and la Chabola de la Hechicera. At the other end, near to Labastida, there is an important wine presses site on which the coveted grape was tread. In Rioja Alavesa you can also visit several medieval villages. Laguardia is the entire region's figurehead, the starting point of what is known as the wine route, which brings together the historical and cultural legacy of the region and everything related to the world of wine. Other villages which are tourist attractions are Pe\u00f1acerrada, Labraza, Labastida, Elvillar, Samaniego and Elciego.  \n### Nature  \n#### Natural areas  \nTxindoki Mountain  \nThe approximate 7,200\u00a0km\u00b2 area of the Basque Autonomous Community is basically home to two types of landscape: a coastline which is green, humid and mountainous (which is the location of the regions of Biscay, Gipuzkoa and the Alavese Mountain), and the vast and dry southern plains of \u00c1lava. Between both of these extremes, the Alavese Plain acts as a transition zone. There are 19 natural areas of different categories, spread out across the entire Autonomous Community, and they can all be visited. Ten of them have the status of National Parks: Pe\u00f1as de Aya National Park, Pagoeta and Aralar in Gipuzkoa; Izki, Valderejo and Entzia in \u00c1lava; Gorbea, and Urkiola in \u00c1lava and Biscay; Arma\u00f1\u00f3n in Biscay and Aizkorri in Gipuzkoa and \u00c1lava. Furthermore, there are six Protected Biotopes: Inurritza, Leizaran and the abrasion platform (Flysch) in Gipuzkoa; Itxina and Gaztelugatxe in Biscay; and the Laguardia Lagoons in \u00c1lava. In this rural setting there are some of the most important religious monuments such as La Antigua Roman hermitage, in Zumarraga, the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Arantzazu, the patron saint of Gipuzkoa, or the basilica of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Many museums present traditional Basque culture, such as the Sagardoetxea (Cider Museum) or the Cider House in Astigarraga (Gipuzkoa), the ironworks of Agorregui (Gipuzkoa) and El Pobal (Biscay), the Elosu Museum of Basque Pottery (\u00c1lava)...  \n#### Active tourism  \nSurf in the Basque Autonomous Community.  \nThe Basque Country has a wide selection of active tourism companies and all types of adventure sport businesses, from the most technical and specialised to the more common forms such as surfing, mountain biking, hiking and bird watching. There are thirteen Long-Distance - or GR \u2013 footpaths, signposted and marked out with red and white marks, which make it possible to cross the Autonomous Community in all directions, discovering the frontiers of Gipuzkoa (GR 121), the Alavese Plain through the route along the side of the mountains (GR 25) or the Urdaibai biosphere reserve through GR 98. There are also Short-Distance - or PR \u2013 footpaths, signposted with white and yellow stripes, which allow you to complete shorter routes which are accessible to the general public, but with a similar theme. Cycling enthusiasts have 130 kilometres of Greenways which have been opened up, nine roads recovered from old railway lines which had fallen into disuse. Examples include the Plazaola Greenway, which crosses the valley of the River Leizaran, the old Basque-Navarre railway line, The Zadorra Greenway, between the \u00c1lava reservoirs, or the Arrazola Greenway, in the surrounding area of Mount Anboto.  \n### Basque coast  \n<ImageHere>Gaztelugatxe\nThe Basque coast comprises more than 250 kilometres of beaches, sandy areas, islands, rias, marshes, cliffs, fishing villages and rock formations (flysch) which are unique in the world. The Basque coast connects villages which have economies which are still strongly linked to the sea, such as Bermeo, Ondarroa and Getaria, with other towns which are traditionally tourist attractions such as Zarautz, Lekeitio and Mundaka. One of the symbols of the maritime Biscay is Gaztelugatxe, an island which is crowned by a hermitage and linked to land by a path with steps. Located on the coastline near to the estuary of the Ria of Urdaibai, a natural area which has been declared a biosphere reserve. In Gipuzkoa, it is worth highlighting Zarautz beach, one of the biggest and most popular among surfers, much like the beach of Mundaka in Biscay. Zumaia and its abrasion platform (Flysch), and the wetlands of Plaiaundi, in Hondarribia. In addition to this there are the recently created modern marinas such as Hondarribia, Orio and Getxo. To explore the culture and history associated with the sea, there are numerous models and objects in the Bilbao Maritime Museum, the Fisherman's Museum and the Naval Museum in Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n, among others. Furthermore, Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n Aquarium is famous for its eye-catching oceanarium through which a Perspex tube passes which is home to a wide range of species from the Cantabrian Sea. The Camino de Santiago (214.2\u00a0km) travels along the entire Basque coast and it is one of the oldest pilgrim routes. The route begins in the port of Hondarribia (Gipuzkoa), recalling the steps of the first pilgrims who arrived by sea.\n\n### Business tourism  \nBilbao Exhibition Center  \nDonostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Bilbao have much experience in the area of conferences, meetings, conventions and incentives. All three have Convention Bureaux, which facilitate the organisation of events. The three capitals have opted for stylish sites, from which it is worth highlighting the Kursaal Congress Centre (San Sebasti\u00e1n), designed by Rafael Moneo, the Europa Congress Centre (Vitoria-Gasteiz) and the Euskalduna Conference Centre (Bilbao), which has the appearance of a ship which is continuously under construction. There are a further dozen sites on offer with different shapes and sizes for all types of gatherings, such as Ficoba, in Irun. Bilbao is also home to the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, a large, versatile space for every type of event.  \n### Events  \nVitoria-Gasteiz party  \nThe community's cultural agenda is extensive and diverse, bringing together top notch cultural and festive events involving all styles of music, theatre, dance, comics and cinema.  In Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n, the most famous event is the San Sebastian International Film Festival, which is held in September. Hundreds of films have been presented there, and it has been visited by movie stars such as Lauren Bacall, Alfred Hitchcock, Robert Mitchum and Woody Allen. The International Jazz Festival, which takes place in July, and the Quincena Musical, which is held in August, are the two other best known competitions in the capital of Gipuzkoa. It is also worth highlighting the Big Week of Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n in August, where you can watch the best fireworks around. In Bilbao, music takes on special importance in the summer, with rock festivals such as the BBK Live Festival or the Azkena Rock Festival, which attract the very best artists. It is also worth mentioning the traditional Opera season of the A.B.A.O. (Bilbao Association of Friends of Opera), the Biscay Choir Week and the concerts by the Symphonic Orchestra of Bilbao throughout the year. Film buffs gather in May in the Horror and Fantasy Film Festival and in November in the International Festival of Documentary and Short Films. There is also a special place for the famous Big Week of Bilbao which is always held in August, with countless activities and shows. In Vitoria-Gasteiz one of the most important cultural events is the International Theatre Festival which lasts from October to November, and the International Jazz Festival, where the best jazz musicians get together. Another notable event in the capital of \u00c1lava is the Festival of the White Virgin, which is held at the beginning of August and for which the entire city comes out to celebrate.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following images shows a location that was named the European Green Capital in 2012?\nChoice list: \nA.

Flag bearers carry the national flag of their country at the opening ceremony and closing ceremony of the Olympic Games.  Men and women from across the country and from a variety of sports have carried the flag at both the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games.  More than half of those representing the teams at the Summer Olympics are track or field athletes, though that sport does account for the most competitors at the Games.  \nJames Bickford, Norman Armitage, and Pat McDonald have all performed the duty twice.  Several athletes born in other countries have carried the flag, including those from Norway, Ireland, Sudan, Germany, and Czechoslovakia.  \n## Firsts  \nUS team manager Matthew Halpin was the first to carry the flag at the 1906 Intercalated Games, though that event is no longer considered by the International Olympic Committee to be part of Olympic history.  Ralph Rose became the first competitor to have the honor when he led the team out at the 1908 Summer Games, the first official Olympic Games to feature a parade of nations.  The first woman to represent the United States was fencer Janice Romary in 1968, her sixth consecutive Summer Olympics.  Native American Ojibwe Taffy Abel was the first person to represent the United States at the Winter Olympics when he was chosen to carry the flag at the inaugural Games in Chamonix in 1924. Rafer Johnson became the first African American to serve as the nation's flag bearer at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Janice Romary became the first woman to carry the flag at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Irish-born Pat McDonald, one of the \"Irish Whales\", became the first athlete to be selected as the flag bearer twice when he performed his second duty in 1924.  In 1956 two other athletes led the U.S. team out for a second time, James Bickford at the Winter Olympics and Norman Armitage at the Summer Games.  \n## Selection and reactions  \n<ImageHere>Lopez Lomong says he felt \"blessed\" to be selected as the 2008 flag bearer.\nThe flag bearers are chosen by a vote of the team captains of each sport.  \nAthletes view their selection of flag bearer as a great honor:\n\n## Flag dipping  \n<ImageHere>Ralph Rose competing at the 1908 Olympics after not dipping the flag in the opening ceremony\nOlympic protocol is that the flag bearer dips their flag to the head of state as part of the parade.  It has become tradition that the U.S. flag is not dipped, though the origins of this are surrounded by legend and are widely misreported:  \nThe parade of nations was introduced at the 1906 Intercalated Games with Matthew Halpin as the U.S. flag bearer.  Halpin gladly dipped the flag, noting that when he did so King George I of Greece \"staked me to a smile that made me feel like I belonged\".  The controversy began at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London where flag bearers were expected to dip the flag to Edward VII on two occasions.  Research by the International Society of Olympic Historians concluded that the flag bearer was Ralph Rose and that he might not have dipped the flag to the British King on one of those occasions in support of Irish struggle against British imperialism.  Martin Sheridan is often attributed with the explanation by stating at the time \"This flag dips to no earthly king\" but no evidence of this can be found.  Modern versions of the story describe how the Stars and Stripes have never been dipped during the parade of nations since 1908 but this is apocryphal.  It has been dipped on three occasions since then: 1912, 1924, and 1932.  \nThe 1932 winter games were held in Lake Placid and, though head of state President Herbert Hoover would normally have greeted the parade of nations, the duty was passed to New York governor Franklin Roosevelt.  This was the last time that the flag was dipped at the Olympics as political forces intervened thereafter.  The head of state awaiting the athletes at the 1936 Summer Games was Adolf Hitler, to whom the U.S. refused to lower their flag.  The 1940 Olympics were cancelled due to the onset of World War II and, in 1942, the United States Congress introduced the United States Flag Code which stated: \"That no disrespect should be given to the flag of the United States of America, the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing.\"  However, since the Flag Code is legally unenforceable, it appears to be merely codified tradition.\n\n## Foreign-born representatives  \n<ImageHere>Pat McDonald, the first athlete to carry the flag for the United States on two occasions and the first flag bearer born outside of the U.S.\nSeveral foreign-born athletes have represented the United States at the opening ceremonies.  Irishman Pat McDonald immigrated to the U.S. and was the first in 1920 and he, at the age of 42, became the oldest Olympic track & field champion.  Though he did not compete, he also went on to lead the U.S. team at the following Summer Olympics.  \nRolf Monsen, a multi-discipline Winter sports athlete born in Oslo, Norway, immigrated to the U.S. and competed as an American in 1928 and 1932.  He qualified for the 1936 Games and though an injury prevented him from taking part, he was still chosen to carry the flag.  \nThe American team at the 1936 Summer Games were led by Berlin-born, highly regarded gymnast Al Jochim who immigrated to the U.S.  \nOlga Fikotov\u00e1 was a discus-thrower at the 1956 Summer Olympics and the only athlete to win a gold medal for her home country Czechoslovakia in that year.  She began a much-publicised romance with American athlete Harold Connolly, much to the frustration of the Communist authorities.  Fikotov\u00e1 was accused of being a traitor and the Czechoslovak Olympic Committee banned her from representing her country again.  Now living in the U.S., she would go on to compete for her adopted country in the next four Summer Games.  Despite not being able to replicate her success, Fikotov\u00e1 was chosen to lead the American team at the 1972 Games in Munich, West Germany.  \nLopez Lomong carried the flag at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China and became the fifth flag bearer to be born outside the United States.  As a teenager in war-torn Sudan, Lomong was one of several thousand boys brought to America as a refugee in 2001.  His selection came during a time when the U.S. and other Western countries had been critical of the Chinese government's close links with Sudan, a country accused of human rights violations and war crimes.\n\n## Other notes  \nGodfrey Dewey, son of Melvil Dewey the inventor of Dewey Decimal Classification, was the president of the Lake Placid Organizing Committee and was largely responsible for the successful candidature of Lake Placid for the 1932 Winter Olympics.  In addition to his role as the U.S. ski team manager he was chosen as the flag bearer for the 1928 Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland.  \n## List of flag bearers  \nList of flag bearers:  \nKey\n\nQuestion: Which of the following athletes was the first to carry the flag for the United States on two occasions and was also the first flag bearer born outside of the U.S.?\nChoice list: \nA.

The events were held on 27 July 1936, 31 July 1937, 30 July 1938 and 29 July 1939, and were the evening highlight of the International Horse Racing Week Munich-Riem. Members of the SS-Cavalry, variety show girls, and international stars performed at the open-air revue with up to 2,500 participants.  \nIn addition to highlighting Munich as a travel destination, the event was intended to present Germany's Nazi regime as cosmopolitan and friendly to foreigners, and promote Nazi ideology.  \nPostcard promoting Munich as Hitler's \"Capital of German Art\", designed by Ludwig (Lutz) Ehrenberger, in the Olympia-Sommer 1936. In the foreground the amazon with longbow and victory wreath. The award of the horse races was The Brown Ribbon of Germany.\n\n## Origin  \nThe International Racing Week at Munich-Riem was invented in 1934 to present world-class equestrian sports in Munich and attract visitors to show off the new Nazi society. The event was organized by Christian Weber, whose personal friendship with Adolf Hitler went back to the early 1920s. All international horse clubs were invited. In 1936, the prize money for the Brown Ribbon of Germany was doubled. Being 100.000 Reichsmark, it was thus the continent's highest prize. That year was also a special anniversary, \"500 Years of Horse Racing in Munich\", which featured numerous major events. According to Weber, the evening highlight of the horse races for the Brown Ribbon should make a noise at home and in the world. Together with Paul Wolfrum, the head of tourism of Munich and Southern Bavaria, they created the \"Night of the Amazons\", an evening event with 10,000 spectators.  Weber used the former summer residence of the Bavarian kings as scenery for his ambitious self-portrayal and that of the Nazi ruling system.  \n## Preliminary work and financing  \nDespite weeks of personnel-intensive rehearsals and preparations, no alternative date was set. The enormously expensive financing was taken over by the Nazi regime organization The Brown Ribbon of Germany. For the first event in 1936, the two access avenues and the entire palace complex were provided with electric light for the first time. Concerns of the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes also had to be addressed, e.g., fire hazards due to large fireworks shows, and damage caused by horse hooves, crowds of people and underground installations. Security personnel were provided by the SS.  \n## Content  \nThe event always consisted of two different parts, which differed in content from year to year. Obvious Nazi propaganda was avoided. Besides international stars, hundreds of horses were put on stage. The first part of the event had a historical theme, which was located in the courtly 18th century environment, thereby branded as decadent. In the second part of the event, the \"New Age\" and \"Master Race\", glorified by the Nazi ideology, were presented. Under the pretext of ancient mythology more nudity was staged from year to year. A bronze sculpture created by Franz Stuck in 1913/14 was considered the Amazon par excellence. A replica was erected in front of the Villa Stuck in Munich in 1936.  \nIn 1936 Hans Gru\u00df, the manager of the Deutsches Theater (Munich), directed the event. In 1937 he was replaced by Paul Wolz, who directed it until 1939. The dance performances incorporated choreographic inspiration from the latest UFA GmbH and Hollywood films.  \n<ImageHere>The German sculptor and painter Franz Stuck created 1914 the bronze casting of a nude amazon. This recast from 1936 was a gift to Adolf Hitler.\n\n\n## Lighting technology  \nWilhelm Hindelang was responsible for the lighting production. During a stay in New York City in 1936, the electrical engineer had studied the various lighting systems on Broadway theaters and the night illumination of Niagara Falls. The illumination of the \"Night of the Amazons\" enabled him to express his creativity and expertise. He worked out the lighting plans and created lighting effects with Ultraviolet light chains, colored underwater spotlights and a dance floor illuminated from below. A large part of the lighting and the telephone system for the direction and lighting instructions were provided by the armed forces (Wehrmacht). In 1938, the passionate amateur filmmaker with his innovative use of light was able to shoot the event on Kodachrome. It was probably the first color film shot at night in the German Reich.  \n## Horsemanship  \nEquestrian skills - including the High School of Classical dressage - were used by the ambitious SS riders to create a public impact. Many of the riders were members of the SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde who guarded the Dachau concentration camp during the day. Hermann Fegelein, award-winning jump jockey and ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Christian Weber and head of the SS Main Riding School Riem since 1937, trained them as well as the \"Amazons\".  \n## Dance  \nThe  Munich State Opera ballet took part in the first Night of the Amazons in 1936. However, since classical ballet was said to have not enough Germanness and national pride and to be affected from foreign influence, a wide variety of dance schools with expressive dance were used from 1937 onwards. Following the Nazi ideology, the dancers symbolized the \"voluntary and vibrant integration into the large community structure with the so-called New Dance\". Young girls of the NS girls\u2018 organisation Faith and Beauty Society were used for mass scenes, too.  \n## Celebrity participants  \nEvery year, internationally renowned stars participated in the event, such as Margaret Severn from New York and Eugene Iskoldoff with dancers from the Covent Garden Ballet Russe in 1936. In the following years, the Scala-Girls from Berlin and the Hiller-Girls performed as well as singers like Hans-Hermann Nissen and Erna Sack.  \n## Nudity  \nChristian Weber increasingly made use of the insight he had gained during his 1937 visit to the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne - and the relevant establishments in Paris - that \"our naked German girls are better looking than the French women.\" His conclusion for the Night of the Amazons was: \"All we have to do is take off the clothes of the girls right here at home, put them into the spotlight, and men with money to spend will forsake Paris for Munich.\" From 1938 onward the number of girls dressed only in skin-colored panties increased. For the first time, 150 bronzed male and female participants were shown, who were covered with bronze-colored theatrical make-up from the crown to the sole, thus bearing considerable health risks.  \n<ImageHere>Detail of the illustrated program of the 1939 show. The artist, Albert Reich (1881\u20131942), was art director of the shows and created the cover for the first edition of Hitler's Mein Kampf.\n\n\n## Music  \nThe first part of the series began with fanfare blowers, followed by German military marches. After the break classical music alternated with singing. Hunting horn and alpine folk music were played as well.  \n## Spectators and Playing Field  \nTribunes and standing places were placed on the extended so-called inner ground floor of the Nymphenburg Park. The celebrities had their places of honour on the castle's perron. In 1936 almost all European kings were present. With 20.000 visitors, the Night of the Amazons was always sold out. To offer something to the curious spectators in front of the castle, the building was illuminated, open fire burned on pylons, gondolas drove down the castle canal.  \n## Safety Precautions  \nEvery year members of the Gestapo combed the extensive area of the Nymphenburg Palace with great care as the presence of Adolf Hitler was hoped for. Hitler, however, preferred the Bayreuth Festival with Richard Wagner's music taking place the same time.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the images provided?\nChoice list: \nA.

The course starts and finishes in Granollers and passes through Les Franqueses del Vall\u00e8s and La Garriga. It is among the more popular half marathon events in Spain with around 10,000 runners taking part in the day's events.. In addition to the main half marathon race, there are two further events: a 5\u00a0km race for fun runners and \"the mini\", which hosts a range of short distances for children.  \nIn its early editions the race attracted a principally Spanish audience. The first African winner was Ezequiel Bitok in 1993 and his course record run of 1:01:48 hours marked the introduction of elite-level participation at the event. Alberto Juzdado became the first Spaniard to complete the course in under one hour and two minutes in 1998. In 2000, Esther Kiplagat of Kenya was the first foreign female to win at the event and she improved the course record by over two minutes. Two consecutive wins by marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie in 2005/2006 brought a Spanish all-comers record time of 60:08 minutes and further recognition of the race's elite level status, as did 10,000\u00a0m world champion Gete Wami's course record time of 1:10:24.2 hours in the women's race. The 2004 Olympic marathon champion Stefano Baldini and two-time European champion Marta Dom\u00ednguez won the men's and women's races in 2007.  \nKenya's Samuel Wanjiru became the first man to run a sub-60-minute half marathon in Spain at the 2008 Granollers race: his time of 59:26 minutes was the fourth fastest time in the world that year. Both Wanjiru and Dom\u00ednguez claimed their second Granollers titles the year afterwards. In 2012, Catalonia's Carles Castillejo became the first Spanish male winner since 1999 by defeating world record holder Patrick Makau.  \n## Past winners  \n<ImageHere>Haile Gebrselassie had back-to-back wins in 2005 and 2006.\n\n<ImageHere>Spain's Marta Dom\u00ednguez is a two-time women's winner.\n\n<ImageHere>Kenyan Samuel Wanjiru set a Spanish all-comers record in 2008.\nKey:\n\n\nQuestion: Which athlete set a Spanish all-comers record in 2008?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Occupy London  \nOccupy London was a political movement in London, England, and part of the international Occupy movement. While some media described it as an \"anti-capitalist\" movement, in the statement written and endorsed by consensus by the Occupy assembly in the first two days of the occupation, occupiers defined themselves as a movement working to create alternatives to an \"unjust and undemocratic\" system. A second statement endorsed the following day called for \"real global democracy\". Due to a pre-emptive injunction, the protesters were prevented from their original aim to camp outside the London Stock Exchange. A camp was set up nearby next to St Paul's Cathedral. On 18 January 2012, Mr Justice Lindblom granted an injunction against continuation of the protest but the protesters remained in place pending an appeal. The appeal was refused on 22 February, and just past midnight on 28 February, bailiffs supported by City of London Police began to remove the tents.  \nThe protests began in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, United States, and with support from tax avoidance protest group UK Uncut and the London-based contingent of the Spanish 15M movement. In October protesters established a second encampments in Finsbury Square just to the north of the City of London. In November, a third site was opened in a disused office complex owned by UBS. Named by protesters as the Bank of Ideas, the site was located in Hackney and was evicted in late January 2012.  \nA fourth site was established in late December, at the disused premises of Old Street Magistrates Court in east London. The site's owners objected to its proposed long-term use by occupiers, and agreement was reached for the building to be vacated by the end of January 2012. In February 2012, occupiers were evicted from their main camp ar St Paul's, and from the Bank of Ideas, leaving Finsbury Square as the last London site to remain occupied. The Finsbury Square camp was cleared by authorities in June 2012.  \n## Chronology  \n### 2011 events  \n#### October  \nOn 10 October 2011, a campaign was launched on Facebook for protests to take place at the London Stock Exchange on 15 October in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York and with multiple other protests planned worldwide for that day.date=July 2021  \nAssange speaks at the Occupy London outside the cathedral in the City of London.  \nThe London Stock Exchange in Paternoster Square was the initial target for the protesters on 15 October. However, the police blocked access to the square, enforcing a High Court injunction against public access. 2,500\u20133,000 people gathered nearby outside St Paul's Cathedral, with around 250 camping overnight. During the afternoon of 15 October Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, gave an impromptu speech to the protesters on the topic of anonymity after he was challenged by police for wearing a mask as he walked to the protest. On the Sunday morning a canon of St. Paul's, Giles Fraser, asked the police to leave the cathedral steps, saying he was happy for people to \"exercise their right to protest peacefully\" outside the cathedral.  \nOn 16 October, a gathering of over 500 Occupy London protesters collectively agreed upon and issued the following 'Initial Statement':  \nBy 17 October, an encampment of around 150 tents together with makeshift tarpaulin shelters was clustered around the west side of St Paul's Cathedral.  \nOn 21 October, the Dean of St Paul's announced that the cathedral would be closing until further notice as a result of the Occupy London camp pitched outside, and asked the protesters to leave the vicinity of the building \"so that the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible\". On the evening of the 21st it was reported that the protesters had decided that they would remain in their encampment outside the cathedral, and that they believed that they could not be lawfully removed from the site without a court order.  \nOn 22 October, the protesters established a second camp in Finsbury Square, just north of the City of London in the London Borough of Islington.  \n<ImageHere>Solidarity poster referencing the We are the 99% slogan.\nOn 26 October it was reported that the Dean of St Paul's had decided that the cathedral would reopen on 28 October, following the resolution of all health and safety concerns. The move was described as an \"embarrassing U-turn\" by the British national newspaper The Daily Telegraph.  \nOn 27 October, Giles Fraser resigned as Canon Chancellor of St Paul's over disagreements on the handling of the demonstrators, saying \"I resigned because I believe that the chapter has set on a course of action that could mean there will be violence in the name of the church.\"  \nOn 28 October, the movement's first set of demands, \"Democratise The City of London Corporation\", was published.\n\n#### November  \nOn 1 November Graeme Knowles, the dean of St Paul's, resigned following the backlash against his Chapter's resolution to forcibly evict the Occupy London protesters from outside the cathedral. The City of London Corporation proceeded to take legal action against the camp at St Pauls, without support from the cathedral. Canary Wharf Group took legal action on 3 November to prevent Occupy London protesters from setting up camp in London's Docklands.  \nOn 18 November, protesters took over a disused office complex owned by the bank UBS, located in the London Borough of Hackney. The site was opened to the public the following day as the Bank of Ideas, and claimed to provide free services including a library, seminars and various discussion related events. On 28 November protesters at the Hackney site said they would contest attempts by lawyers to have them evicted.  \n#### December  \n<ImageHere>Caroline Lucas, at the time leader of the Green party, discussing green economics with occupiers at the Bank of Ideas on 6 December 2011.\nIn early December, the City of London Police made reference to Occupy London in a letter warning businesses about potential terrorist threats. It stated that: \"It is likely that activists aspire to identify other locations to occupy, especially those they identify with capitalism. City of London Police has received a number of hostile reconnaissance reports concerning individuals who would fit the anti-capitalist profile. All are asked to be vigilant regarding suspected reconnaissance, particularly around empty buildings.\" By late December, consensus among occupiers at the main camp in St Paul's had seemed to coalesce round a view that is would be better to leave voluntarily as long as they can be allowed to keep a small presence, and negotiations were started to see if agreement could be reached with the cathedral. Also, in late December, a fourth site was established in east London at an unused court and police complex. Occupiers announced plans to use the new site to host a symbolic \"trial of the 1%\"\n\n### 2012 events  \n<ImageHere>A view of the camp at Finsbury Square \u2013 by late February 2012 this was Occupy London's last remaining site, until it too was cleared in mid June.\nOn 18 January, the High Court ruled in favour of the City of London Corporation, giving them the power to order the eviction of occupiers from the St Paul's Camp. A spokesperson for the City said they would not further pursue eviction until 20 January, to give the occupiers a chance to appeal against the ruling. The appeal date was later set to 13 February 2012. Comparing the St Paul's camp as it was in January 2012 with its first few weeks, journalists such as Sid Ryan, Brendan O'Neill and Laurie Penny noted a change of character, with energy being diverted from political activism into caring for homeless and mentally ill people attracted by the companionship and shelter. Ryan has argued that despite caring for the homeless being a worthwhile cause, it may help the movement achieve change in the wider world if the camp is evicted.  \nOn 30 January, occupiers were evicted from the site where they had set up their Bank of Ideas, by bailiffs acting on behalf of UBS, who owned the premises.  \nIn mid February, Occupy London took over an abandoned school in Islington, which they called the School of Ideas.  They were evicted two weeks later, with authorities arranging for the school to be bulldozed on 28 February. Also on 28 February, occupiers and their tents were removed from the area surrounding St. Paul's Cathedral, by a team of bailiffs supported by riot police. The St Paul's site had been the last surviving high-profile camp of the worldwide Occupy movement. At the time of its eviction it was also the largest one remaining. According to the Financial Times, Occupy activists insisted that their campaigning would continue, with some displaying banners announcing that the protests so far were \"just the beginning.\"  \nIn April, Bloomberg reported that the St Paul's camp cost London authorities just over a million pounds in monitoring and legal fees, while the Finsbury Square camp had so far cost about \u00a310,000.  \nIn December 2012, the Corporation of the City of London acquiesced to one of the Occupy London demands, releasing information about a previously secret bank account called City's Cash. This fund had existed for hundreds of years and proved to contain more than \u00a31.319bn. With an income of \u00a3145m per annum, 29% of this comes from school fees, with a further eight per cent coming from rents and nine per cent coming from grants, reimbursements, and contributions. However, the largest source of revenue was 52 per cent from investments.\n\n\nQuestion: Which event do these images collectively represent?\nChoice list: \nA. Protests against global warming\nB.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nAfter the skirmishes, in front of the Hotel Great Britain Greek Evzones & Civilians passing through the corpses of the Turkish Civilians.\n\n<ImageHere>Article from The New York Times, May 17, 1919\nOn the afternoon of May 11, 1919, the Commander of the 1st Infantry Division of the Hellenic Army, positioned in Kavala, Colonel Nikolaos Zafeiriou, received orders for the operation. The next morning, the landing force, consisting of 13,000 soldiers, as well as auxiliary personnel, 14 transport ships and escorted by 3 British and 4 Greek destroyers, headed to Smyrna. Zafeiriou's order to his soldiers, who learned about their destination only after the departure, was the following:  \nOn May 14, 1919, the Greek mission in Smyrna read a statement announcing that Greek troops would be arriving the next day in the city. Smith reports that this news was \"received with great emotion\" by the Greek population of the city while thousands of Turkish residents gathered in the hill that night lighting fires and beating drums in protest.The night before the landing all the Turks staying as lodgers in the Greek Quarters of the 1st and the 2nd Cordon were massacred along with their families. For that reason none of the Turks dared to approach the Greek quarter in the morning. Therefore the accountants started giving all the 3 monthly payments to the soldiers and the officers to prevent money being stolen by the Greeks. Later, translations of proclamations issued by the Turks during this occasion, showed that the intention was not purely pacific resistance. The same night, several hundred prisoners, mostly Turks, were released from a prison, with the complicity of the Ottoman authorities and Italian major in charge of the prison. Some of them armed purchased arms from a depot near the barracks.  \nThe Greek occupation of Smyrna started the following day, where thousands were gathered on the seafront, waving Greek flags on the docks where the Greek troops were expected to arrive. The Metropolitan of Smyrna, Chrysostomos of Smyrna blessed the first troops as they arrived at 08:00. A colonel, who had neither the will nor the prestige to force himself relentlessly on his men, was in charge of the operation and neither the appointed High Commissioner nor high-ranking military individuals were there for the landing resulting in miscommunication and a breakdown of discipline. Most significantly, this resulted in the 1/38 Evzone Regiment landing north of where they were to take up their post. As a result, they had to march south passing a large part of the Greek crowds celebrating the landing and also the Ottoman government Konak and the barracks of Ottoman troops. A Turk fired a shot (Smith indicates that no one knows who fired the shot) and chaos resulted with the Greek troops firing multiple shots into the Konak and the barracks. The Ottoman troops surrendered and the Greek regiment begun marching them up the coast to a ship to serve as a temporary prison. Allied officers in the harbor reported seeing Greek troops bayoneting multiple Turkish prisoners during the march and then saw them thrown into the sea. Prisoners were forced to shout \"Long live Venizelos!\" and \"Long live Greece!\".The ones who did not shout like Colonel S\u00fcleyman Fethi Bey or Pharmacist Captain Ahmet Bey, the uncle-in-law of Fahrettin Altay and many others like the journalist Hasan Tahsin were martyred with bayonets.  Donald Whittall, a British citizen and one of the few neutral observers during the landing, remarked about the treatment of Turkish prisoners, \"They were made to go through no humiliation and received a good deal\". But Whittall estimated that thirty unarmed prisoners were slaughtered.  The captain of 6 reported that a Turkish officer, marching with his hands up, veered out of line. He was hit by a Greek soldier's rifle butt on the back of his head. When he tried to stand up he was hit again and bayoneted, before the top of his head was blown off.This claim was also verified by first-lieutenant Zekai Kaur, a Cretan Turk who was made a prisoner and put into the Greek transatlantic ship \"Patris\", on 15th of May 1919 and was among the prisoner column in the streets until they reached the cargo deck of the prisoner ship. He saw many among his column being pulled away, beaten, wounded and being killed where stopping meant death. While 2 Greek journalists were searching & shouting for him to take revenge on Kaur being a Greek-speaking officer in the Censorship Bureau. Kaur saw that a \"bulky\" priest, Chrysostomos of Smyrna, with a cross in one hand and a knife in the other executed a Turkish soldier in front of the Greek civilian crowd cheering in Cafe Foti (Klonaridis).  \nViolence and disorder followed the landing and Greek troops and Greek citizens of Smyrna participated in these actions. Some shops belonging to Jews were also plundered by Greek soldiers. For the days following the landing, Greek troops arbitrarily detained around 2,500 people. Looting of Turkish houses in the city and in the surrounding areas began on the night of May 15 and continued for many days after that. The Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry reported that:  \nDead bodies of Turkish civilians being dragged in the wet street to the cart, while Greek & other civilians watch in front of the Hotel Great Britain.  \nA photo of the Greek landing  \nGreek troops loading artillery  \nAdmiral Calthorpe left the area on May 21 and on May 23, the Greek commander in the area went against orders issued by the Allies and Venizelos by ordering the expansion of military operations in Ayd\u0131n and \u015euhut. These operations initially did not face significant resistance, but ethnic violence erupted along the way leading to significant violence and chaos; particularly in the Battle of Ayd\u0131n from May 27 until June 27, 1919.  In many areas, Greek forces demobilized the Ottoman police and then left the area resulting in Turkish mobs looting Greek property and killing Greek citizens. This was retaliation for atrocities committed by Greek soldiers and civilians in Smyrna and the surrounding area against Turks.  \nWhen the atrocities were exposed and condemned by the British House of Commons on 26 June, Venizelos faced British diplomatic pressure to conduct an official inquiry.  \nCourt martial on August 15, 1919 led by the Greek High Commissioner for the violence on May 15 and May 16 pronounced 74 convictions (including 48 Greeks, 13 Turks, 12 Armenians and one Jew).  \nAccording to the Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry, the casualties on 15 May were as follows: Greek army (2 killed, 6 wounded); 100 Greek civilians (20 killed, 20 drowned, 60 wounded); 300-400 Turkish civilians killed or wounded.  \nEyewitnesses in Smyrna reported higher civilian casualties among the Turks. The U.S. Naval Officer of the 6, which was berthed at Smyrna harbor, estimated 300-500 Turks killed with a total of 700-1000 casualties. Regarding the Greek casualties, he estimated 2 killed and 15-20 wounded soldiers, 20-30 killed and 40-50 wounded civilians Reverend Alexander MacLachlan, a Canadian in charge of the international college at Smyrna, estimated 500 Turks killed in his \"Statement of an Eyewitness\". He however mentions that his estimate on the evening of the landing was inaccurate and stated that if he made his statement a week later he would have given 800-1000 Turks killed only in the center of Smyrna on the first day. The estimates were far lower than the actual numbers as they did not count the dead thrown into sea. MacLachlan stated that:  \nMacLachlan's claim is also verified by Kaur. Many naked bodies of the Turks everyday on the following days were washed up on the shores of \u0130zmir some of these were Turkish Military Personnel and Civilians who were huddled in to the prisoner ship \"Patris\". Zekai Kaur being a prisoner on the ship states that the officers were put into the ship's hold full of artillery carrier animals' dungs and after the visit and the protest of a Scottish officer they were put to the upper decks. During their imprisonement Greeks threw overboard and drowned anyone who went up to get air. These bodies also hit the shore days later due to tide in the sea. The revend also states that many local Armenians and Jews were also \"victims of that day and night of terror\" and that he saw the bodies of a Jewish lad and the father of an Armenian student of his, since they were mistaken by the Greek soldiers and Greek locals as being Turks since some of them were wearing fez, which was attributed to being Turkish.\n\n## Impacts  \n<ImageHere>1921 illustration by it depicting the landing at Smyrna\nThe Greek army from the first started showing the signs that they had not come for a temporary occupation but rather for a permanent annexation; to incorporate western Anatolia into Greece. This intention was already clear to some Turks after seeing which territories that Greeks had occupied. The Turkish reaction to these developments was anger, resulting in violence in the region. After the initial shock of the landing, Turkish groups started retaliating by committing excesses against the civilian Greek communities residing outside of the occupation zone. While there were large demonstrations against Allied Forces in Istanbul, in Anatolia first armed clash between Turks and Greeks occurred on 28 May at \u00d6demi\u015f. This was between a small body of Turks and the Greek Army. Afterwards, Turkish guerrilla warfare flared up along the line of Greek advance.  \nIt created the Smyrna Zone that administered the area from 1919 until September 9, 1922. After the violence in May 1919, many of the allies began to limit their support for the operation: France and Italy all became resistant to permanent Greek occupation and the stillborn Treaty of S\u00e8vres in 1920 gave administrative control of the area to Greece, while Turkey would retain sovereignty, with permanent sovereignty to be decided after 5 years. The landing in Smyrna was sanctioned by article 69 also signed by the grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet VI. On the other hand it fuelled the Turkish nationalist movement under Mustafa Kemal and large scale atrocities against the Pontic Greek population in Eastern Anatolia. The Greek occupation ended when Turkish forces entered Smyrna (\u0130zmir) on September 9, 1922.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following events occurred during the Greek occupation of Smyrna in 1919, as depicted or described in the provided images and text?\nChoice list: \nA.

Infanterie-Division) was an infantry division of the German Heer during World War II.  \n## History  \n<ImageHere>Ludwigsburg grave of an unknown soldier of the 260th Infantry Division, killed in action in 1942/43\nThe 260th Infantry Division was formed in Karlsruhe (Wehrkreis V) on 26 August 1939, the day of German mobilization, as a division of the fourth Aufstellungswelle. It initially consisted of the Infantry Regiments 460, 470, and 480, which were formed from various replacement battalions. Infantry Regiment 460 was formed from the Replacement Battalions 14 (Weingarten), 56 (Biberach), and 119 (Esslingen), Infantry Regiment 470 from the Replacement Battalions 34 (Heilbronn), 13 (Ludwigsburg), and 35 (T\u00fcbingen), and Infantry Regiment 480 from the Replacement Battalions 21 (Nuremberg), 42 (Hof), and 55 (W\u00fcrzburg). Additionally, the 260th Infantry Division was equipped with the four artillery detachments of Artillery Regiment 260 and the Division Units 260, the later Pioneer Battalion 653. The initial commander of the division was Hans Schmidt.  \nThe division was sent to the Upper Rhine region in October 1939, and spent the Battle of France in the reserves of OKH. It subsequently was placed on occupation duty in France and remained there until July 1941.  \nOn 30 January 1940, the division passed an infantry battalion and an artillery battery to the 296th Infantry Division of the eighth Aufstellungswelle, and later an additional third of the division's strength to the 125th Infantry Division of the eleventh Aufstellungswelle on 21 October 1940. These transferred units were later replaced with division reservists and fresh recruits.  \nThe 260th Infantry Division joined Operation Barbarossa between July and August 1941, and subsequently fought at Kiev, Babruysk, and Moscow before participating in the defensive operations against the Soviet winter campaign of 1941\u201342.\n<ImageHere>Walther Hahm, twice commander of the 260th Division during 1942/43 (photographed in May 1943).\nOn 1 January 1942, Walther Hahm took command of the division.  \nWalther Hahm during his time as commander of the 260th Division, pictured in the Soviet Union  \nIn 1942, the third battalions of each of the three divisional regiments were dissolved due to casualties, downgrading the division from nine to six battalions across three regiments.\n<ImageHere>Dietrich von Choltitz, divisional commander of the 260th Division in mid-to-late 1942.\nBetween May and August 1942, the 260th Infantry Division fought at Spas-Demensk. On 27 August 1942, Dietrich von Choltitz took command of the division. He would hold the post until 6 October, upon which Hahm returned to a second tenure as division commander.  \nIn summer 1943, Grenadier Regiment 470 was dissolved and its two battalions became the third battalions of each of the other regiments, thus shifting the 260th Infantry Division from a division of three regiments with two battalions each to a division of two regiments with three battalions each.  \nBetween September 1943 and May 1944, the 260th Infantry Division took part in the defense of the Mogilev sector. On 9 November 1943, Robert Schl\u00fcter took command of the division.  \nIn October 1943, the second battalion of Grenadier Regiment 367 of the 214th Infantry Division in occupied Norway was given to the 260th Infantry Division as Division Fusilier Battalion 260.  \nIn April 1944, the two battalions of the dissolved Grenadier Regiment 470 were taken out of their respective regiments and the Grenadier Regiment 470 redeployed. With the addition of the Division Fusilier Battalion 260 of October 1943, the 260th Infantry Division had thus become a Division neuer Art 44, a division of three regiments of two battalions each that was additionally strengthened by a seventh independent battalion. On 21 April 1944, Alexander Conrady took command of the division, before he was replaced by G\u00fcnther Klammt on 1 May 1944. Klammt would be the last commander of the 260th Infantry Division.  \nThe 260th Infantry Division was captured and destroyed near Minsk on 9 July 1944. The divisional commander, G\u00fcnter Klammt, was taken prisoner by the Red Army and would remain in captivity until 1955. Its status is listed as \"unknown\" in the German documents of July 1944.

His followers won a series of victories against the Egyptians culminating in the capture of Khartoum in January 1885.  \n<ImageHere>Muhammad Ahmad, who inspired the Ansar movement\nWhen Muhammed Ahmad died a few months later, his successor, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, maintained the independence of the Mahdist State until 1898, when an Anglo-Egyptian force re-conquered the area. The Mahdi's eldest surviving son, Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, was the religious and political leader of the Ansar throughout most of the colonial era of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1898\u20131955) and for a few years after the Sudan gained independence in January 1956. His descendants have led the movement since then.\n\n## History  \n### Mahdiyah  \nMuhammed Ahmad claimed to receive direct inspiration from Allah. After taking power in Sudan between 1883 and 1885, he established the Mahdist regime which was ruled using a modified version of sharia.Ansar of Sudan Muhammed Ahmed appointed three Caliphs or lieutenants: Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, Ali wad Hilu, and his young cousin and son-in-law Muhammad Sharif. He emulated Muhammad, who was followed by the four Rashidun caliphs. Abdillahi corresponded to Abu Bakr, Ali wad Hilu to Umar, and Muhammad Sharif to Ali. Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi was to have taken the place of Uthman, but refused the honor. When the Mahdi died on 22 June 1885 a few months after capturing Khartoum, Abdillahi became head of state, although he had to deal with challenges from members of the Mahdi's family and Muhammad Sharif.  \n#### Followers of the Mahd\u012b  \n<ImageHere>A Mahdist Dervish from Sudan (1899)\n\n<ImageHere>Mahdist in the Khalifa's House, Omdurman, wearing the distinctive patched uniform worn by the followers of the Mahd\u012b\nTo distinguish his followers from adherents of other Sufi orders, Muhammed Ahmad forbade the use of the word dervish (Arabic darw\u012bsh, pl. daraw\u012bsh) to describe his followers, replacing it with the title An\u1e63\u0101r, the term Muhammad used for the people of Medina who welcomed him and his followers after their flight from Mecca.  \"Dervish\" was widely used in the Sudanese context to describe an affiliate of a Sufi denomination or, more specifically, a religious mendicant who chose to reject material wealth. By renaming his followers an\u1e63\u0101r, the Mahd\u012b unified his Sufi and non-Sufi followers under one name. Despite the Mahd\u012b's prohibition, British soldiers and government officials continued to use the term to describe the An\u1e63\u0101r throughout the late 1880s and 1890s. It was used in a pejorative sense by British government officials such as Major FR Wingate of British Military Intelligence. On the other hand, British soldiers, in their accounts of the conflicts, often described the Mahdist \"dervishes'\" as brave and fearless and the word came to suggest a sense of respect and wonder in this context.\n\n#### Mahdist state (1885\u20131898)  \nThe Mahdist State was at first run on military lines as a jihad state, with the courts enforcing Islamic jurisprudence and the precepts of the Mahdi, which had equal force. Later, the Caliph established a more traditional administration. The state was expansionary, and engaged in wars with Ethiopia.  \nIn 1892 General Herbert Kitchener was appointed commander of the Egyptian army. After careful preparations and a slow advance, on 2 September 1898 the main Anglo-Egyptian forces engaged with a Mahdist army of 52,000 at the Battle of Omdurman. With greatly superior firepower, the British won a decisive victory. Caliph Abdillahi fled, and a year later was killed with other Mahdist leaders at the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat (25 November 1899).  \n### Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi (1885\u20131959)  \nIn 1898, after the fall of the Mahdist State the British government placed restrictions on the movements and activity of the Mahdi's son, Sayyid 'Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi. However, he soon emerged as the leader of the Ansar. Throughout most of the colonial era of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the British government considered him important as a moderate leader of the Mahdists.  \nIn the early 1920s, from 5,000\u201315,000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with the prophet Isa, the Islamic interpretation of Jesus and assumed that he would drive the white Christian colonists out of Sudan. The British government found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, the Sayyid was told to put a stop to the pilgrimages.  \nAli al-Mirghani, leader of the Khatmiyya, was often in opposition to Abd al-Rahman and the Ansar. Both of these Sufi movements organized youth groups and supported competing parties in the run-up to independence. The Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 discussed the future of Sudan, among other subjects. The Sudanese were not consulted. Educated Sudanese became increasingly concerned, and the Ansar appealed to many people in this group. The leaders portrayed the Mahdi to them as the first Sudanese nationalist and Abd al-Rahman was to many an attractive leader of the independence movement. In contrast, Ali al-Mirghani and the Khatmiyya became identified with the pro-Egyptian school of thought that favored unity of the Nile Valley.  \nIn August 1944 'Abd al-Rahman met with senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss formation of a pro-independence political party that was not associated with Mahdism. In February 1945 the National Umma Party had been organized and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid 'Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar. The only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding.  \nSayyid 'Abd al-Rahman died in 1959 aged 74. His son, Sadiq al-Mahdi, was imam of the Ansar for the next two years. After his death in 1961, he was succeeded as imam by his brother, Imam al-Hadi al-Mahdi, while al-Sadiq's son, Sadiq al-Mahdi, took over the leadership of the Umma Party.  \n### Sadiq Al-Mahdi (1964\u20132020)  \nThe National Umma Party of Sudan has generally been associated with the Ansar movement. Sadiq al-Mahdi, the grandson of Abd al-Rahman, was elected president of the Umma party in November 1964.Sadig Al-Mahdi  \n#### Military assault on Aba island (1970)  \nIn November 1969 Gaafar Nimeiry became Prime Minister at the head of a mainly civilian government. Ansar-led conservative forces were opposed to the government, and Imam al-Hadi al-Mahdi withdrew to his base in Aba Island. In March 1970 Nimeiri tried to visit the island to talk with the imam, but was prevented by hostile crowds. Fighting later broke out between government forces opposed by up to 30,000 Ansar. Army units backed up by air support assaulted the island, and about 3,000 people were killed.  \nSadiq Al-Mahdi was arrested in 1970, and for many years alternated between spells in prison in Sudan and periods of exile. In 1985 Sadiq al-Mahdi was again elected president of the Umma party. In the 1986 elections he became Prime Minister of Sudan, holding office until the government was overthrown in 1989. After further imprisonment and exile, Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to Sudan in 2000 and in 2002 was elected Imam of the Ansar. In 2003 Sadiq was re-elected President of Umma.Sadig Al-Mahdi  \n## Beliefs  \nAccording to the hadith, \"no one will more resemble me than al-Mahdi\". It is said that the Mahdi will appear \"after hearts become hard and the earth is filled with wickedness\". Following him, the Antichrist will appear, with all the accompanying signs that the Hour has come, one of which will be the descent of the Jesus. Sunnis believe that Jesus will slay al-Masih ad-Dajjal or \"the False Messiah\".  \nMuhammed Ahmed revealed himself as \"al-Mahdi al-Muntazar\", \"the awaited guide in the right path\", usually seen as the Mahdi. His mission was to redeem the faithful and to prepare the way for the second coming of the Prophet Isa. His movement was fundamentalist, demanding a return to the early principles of Islam. Men were to abstain from alcohol and tobacco, and women were to be strictly secluded.  \nAhmed taught that warfare was a duty incumbent upon all Muslims rather than the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). The creed was altered to say that \"Muhammad Ahmad is the Mahdi of God and the representative of His Prophet\".Ansar of Sudan Another change was that zakat (almsgiving) became a tax paid to the state.\n\nQuestion: Which term did Muhammed Ahmad use to describe his followers, as mentioned in the descriptions accompanying the images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\nContext:\n# Lotsa de Casha  \nLotsa de Casha is a picture book written by American entertainer Madonna. It was released on June 7, 2005, by Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The book was written for readers aged six and up. The book's titular character is an Italian greyhound who learns the moral \"money can't buy happiness\". Madonna drew from her life when writing the story, from denouncing materialism to her motherhood. Portuguese artist Rui Paes illustrated the book, and modeled his illustrations on Renaissance and Baroque painting, and the works of painter Caravaggio.  \nCallaway hosted a party for the book release at New York's Bergdorf Goodman store, where Madonna read the story aloud. She also made promotional appearances on television talk shows and gave magazine interviews. Lotsa de Casha debuted at number three on The New York Times Best Seller list. It received mixed reviews from book critics, who found some humor in the story, but felt it did not gel with Paes' illustrations, which received positive feedback.  \n## Synopsis  \nIn a distant land lived a wealthy merchant called Lotsa de Casha. He had everything money could buy, however Lotsa was still unhappy. So he sought out the opinion of all the well-known doctors of the land regarding his misery, but failed to find an answer. One day, his driver told him about a wise old man who lived faraway in an ancient city. Lotsa travels to the wise man who explained that the secret to his happiness was in sharing his wealth with others and putting them before himself. Lotsa was stunned since he had always put forth his own needs first, and became skeptical about the man's words.  \nWhile exploring the ancient city, Lotsa saw a man slogging to change the wheel of his car by himself. But Lotsa did not stop to help and continued walking. He soon got lost and was robbed by two thieves who left him penniless. A distraught Lotsa cried for help to a passing driver and realized it was the same man he had seen earlier. The man, who called himself Mister Forfilla, agreed to give him a ride back to his house, but in exchange Lotsa had to work for him. Throughout their journey Forfilla ordered Lotsa de Casha to transport an assortment of things\u2014including chairs, tables, clothing\u2014to people's homes, who all appreciated the gifts. Forfilla explained Lotsa the same thing as the wise man, that sharing his wealth was the key to happiness.  \nOne night as he was driving the carriage, Lotsa was able to put someone else's need before his own by giving his blanket to a beggar who needed it. They finally reached Lotsa's palace and Forfilla confessed that it was his old home before Lotsa had bought it. Lotsa invited Forfilla inside for lunch, being a changed man now.  \n## Background and writing  \n<ImageHere>alt=Guy Ritchie in a black shirt speaking while holding a microphone.\nIn 2003, Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment for a series of five children's books. She explained that each book dealt \"with issues that all children confront... Hopefully there is a lesson that will help kids turn painful or scary situations into learning experiences\". During the promotion of the fourth book in the series, The Adventures of Abdi, Callaway announced the plans of publishing the fifth and final book titled Lotsa de Casha. The press release stated that the characters will be portrayed as animals with the central character, Lotsa de Casha, shown as an Italian greyhound in the style of Aesop's Fables. It was written for readers aged six and up with the moral that \"money can't buy happiness\". Madonna herself described Lotsa de Casha \"as a story that claims that we can all resist selfishness and do something good for ourselves and for others\". She confirmed that all profits gained from the sales of the book would be donated to charity.  \nWith Grazia magazine, Madonna explained that writing Lotsa de Casha was ironic since she felt it was a \"parable of her life\". The story reflected her own journey from being labeled a \"material girl\" to being a mother. Like the titular character\u2014described by the Associated Press as \"a wealthy Scroogelike greyhound\"\u2014the singer felt that she had changed from being materialistic. \"I spent 15 years of my life thinking about myself, thinking about everything from the point of view of: 'What is in it for me?',\" Madonna pondered. Accepting herself as someone \"privileged\", she realized that \"ultimately material things won't bring you happiness. Most very wealthy people are not happy. Why? They have too much of something they don't need, and they don't share it with other people.\" Lotsa de Casha was dedicated to her then-husband Guy Ritchie since he inspired her.\n\n## Design and illustrations  \n<ImageHere>alt=A group of cartoon animals wearing formal clothing and pointing fingers.\nAccording to Communication Arts, the calligraphy of the book was done by Julian Waters with Japanese novelist Toshiya Masuda as the art director and Krupa Jhaveri as the book designer. The images were illustrated by Portuguese painter Rui Paes, who was contacted by Callaway after seeing his painting in The New York Times Magazine of a Singerie in Norway. Having established that he would maintain the secrecy of the project, Callaway sent him the story-draft, based on which Paes developed a small batch of sketches. Among them were cartoon-like paintings based on anthropomorphic animals by French caricaturist J. J. Grandville. The publishers liked them and the idea of the main characters depicted as animals were carried on for the book.  \nPaes sketched various aspect of the characters which helped him in understanding the different nuances the story presented. It took him almost two years to finish the illustrations with the majority of the work being accomplished in the final twelve months. Paes worked 12\u201314 hours per day uninterruptedly everyday which resulted him getting back pain and Callaway sending him an Aeron chair to aid him. Madonna worked closely with Paes, supplying him the material to be included in the book. She suggested he should travel to Siena and Rome for inspiration, and sent him drawings by her children for inclusion. The artist researched on Renaissance and Baroque painting for further inspiration, including the works of painter Caravaggio. Paes recalled the singer became the inspiration for the image of the wise old man's wife in the story. The animal characters were given as much human qualities and emotions as possible, with hand and body expressions to convey. Paes removed two images from the final illustrations, feeling they were inadequate.\n\n## Publication and reception  \n<ImageHere>alt=Bergdorf Goodman building shot from the exterior opposite street.\nThe book was released on June 7, 2005, at a party hosted by retailer Bergdorf Goodman at New York's Fifth Avenue. It was attended by socialites and artists with signed copies of Lotsa de Casha available to purchase for $75, proceedings going to UNICEF. Attendees were dressed up in 18th century garments, depicting characters from the book. According to Reuters, the book reading at Bergdorf Goodman \"drew puzzled responses from the group of about 25 kids, who appeared to have difficulty grasping the book's morals\". Other promotions included book signing at Borders Time Warner Center and reading sessions at New York libraries. The singer read out to the students of Saint Ann's School from Brooklyn Heights, and handed out autographed copies. Tatiana Delgiannakis from New York Post noted that Madonna employed an Italian accent while reading aloud Lotsa's parts. Madonna appeared on NBC's Today show and ABC's The View to talk about the book, and gave interview in Ladies' Home Journal magazine for its July 2005 issue.  \nLotsa de Casha debuted at number three on The New York Times Best Seller list. Elaine Stuart from Parenting found humor in the names Madonna gave in the book, like naming Lotsa's castle as \"Flasha de Casa\" and the mountain on which it is situated as the \"Muchadougha Mountains\", details she believed would make the readers laugh. Roy Blatchford from Books for Keeps liked the story and rated it four-out-of-five stars. He said that the story avoided any cliche plots, \"creates a number of original cameos and bounces along with humour and lively dialogue, clearly influenced by Madonna's Italian New York background.\" Blatchford complimented Paes' images describing them as \"striking\" and the design as \"eye-catching\" thus making Lotsa de Casha \"a first-class picture book to grace any library\". A review in Publishers Weekly called the story as \"artless fable\" but believed that Paes' illustrations improved it with the \"tongue-in-cheek homage to classic Baroque painting\". The reviewer found that in contrast to the grand images, the story appeared simple and the accented edge on Lotsa's words were \"uncharacteristic of a rich gentleman\". Delgiannakis complimented the \"beautifully illustrated\" images in the book but found it to be littered with \"preachy factoids\" like \"Just because something is expensive, doesn\u2019t mean it's worth it\". Boyd Tonkin from The Independent panned the release, calling it \"howlingly egotistical\" and a vehicle of \"personal gratification\" for Madonna, \"rather than a virtue in itself\". Ilene Cooper of Booklist said that like many other celebrities-turned-authors, Madonna mistakenly thought that she could write books for children.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image is associated with the person to whom the book \"Lotsa de Casha\" was dedicated?\nChoice list: \nA.

The department store chain had a 99-year lease agreement with Rice University since 1945, and RMC bought the company out of the lease in 2017. RMC led the expansion and renovation of the store, which closed in 2018. SHoP Architects, Gensler, James Carpenter Design Associates, and Walter P Moore designed the new structure.  \nIn July 2019, Houston mayor Sylvester Turner, Rice University president David Leebron, and representatives of the city attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the Ion's redevelopment. Master plans for the district were revealed in November 2019. Jan Odegard, the former executive director of Rice University's Ken Kennedy Institute, became the Ion's executive director in June 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ion hosted online programming, including \"Family Tech Night\" and events for startups.  \nIn mid 2020, Greentown Labs announced plans to open a second incubator in Houston, having considered the city since 2019. In September 2020, the firm confirmed plans to retrofit a former Fiesta Mart store, which the operator had closed two months prior because of declining sales. Additionally, Greentown Labs revealed plans to raise $10 million for the renovation project and three years of working capital. The firm had raised approximately $8 million by September 2020, and building construction began the following month.  \nIn February 2021, Turner hosted a \"reveal\" ceremony for the incubator, which had approximately 20 corporate partners and 16 inaugural startups at the time. Companies that contributed to the project included BHP, CenterPoint Energy, Chevron, Gexa Energy, Shell, Vinson & Elkins, Wells Fargo, and Williams. In April 2021, Greentown Labs received a certificate of occupancy and 30 companies began moving into the space. The incubator opened on Earth Day 2021. The grand opening ceremony was livestreamed and had limited in-person attendance because of the pandemic, which also forced Greentown Labs Houston to scale back programming temporarily.  \n#### Tenants and property management  \nChevron Technology Ventures was named the first tenant and program partner for the Ion in August 2020. Microsoft, which also became a program partner, announced in August 2020 it would invest $1 million into social entrepreneurship programs as part of its participation, and was confirmed as a tenant, along with Common Desk, in late 2020. Houston-based Transwestern became the property manager in November 2020.  \nThe Austin-based innovation and mentorship provider Capital Factory has Houston headquarters in the Ion, as of 2021. In October 2021, the musical theatre production company Theatre Under The Stars (TUTS) announced plans to establish an education and arts center as an anchor tenant in the next phase of the district's development. TXRX Labs has operated the Ion Prototyping Lab since January 2022. In addition to the tenant restaurants in the Ion building, Stuff'd Wings has been a district tenant since April 2022. Established in 2019, the restaurants previously operated as a food truck.  \n#### Partnerships and accelerators  \nThe Ion district announced its first academic partnership in January 2020; Rice University's Susanne M. Glasscock School of Continuing Studies offered courses on computer and data science, financial services, human resources, leadership development, and project management to Ion members. In March 2020, the Ion and the Austin-based nonprofit organization DivInc announced a partnership to develop programs for women and minority entrepreneurs. The Latinx Startup Alliance partnered with the Ion to support Latino entrepreneurs and began hosting virtual programming in October 2020. The Houston-based law firm Baker Botts joined Chevron Technology Ventures and Microsoft as a founding partner in March 2021. According to Community Impact Newspaper, the energy, life sciences, and technology-focused firm \"has supported The Ion since its inception and has provided programming over the last few years\". Aramco Americas also joined as a founding partner. In addition to being a tenant, Capital Factory formed a programming partnership with the Ion in October 2021 to offer events and resources on-site for startups.  \nThe Ion's Accelerator Hub includes the Ion Smart and Resilient Cities Accelerator (ISRCA), the Aerospace Innovation Accelerator for Minority Business Enterprises (AIA for MBEs), the Rice Alliance Clean Energy Accelerator, and DivInc Houston. The Ion team established the ISRCA in September 2019 to focus on disaster recovery. Community Impact Newspaper has said the ISRCA \"addresses the needs of Houston and cities across America by deploying technology into existing civic infrastructure\", and participating startups \"have the chance to build relationships with mentors, corporate networks, municipality decision-makers, and stakeholder partners, and gain exposure in the Greater Houston region\". The AIA for MBEs supports startups in their development of solutions for aerospace-related challenges, and the Rice Alliance Clean Energy Accelerator focuses on sustainable energy projects.  \nIn September 2020, the district received $1.5 million from the Economic Development Administration's Build to Scale program to support the Accelerator Hub's creation. The district received a $1.4 million federal grant from the Minority Business Development Agency in October 2020 to establish an aerospace engineering accelerator in partnership with NASA's Johnson Space Center and DivInc. The ISRCA's third cohort began a 12-week program at the Ion in March 2021. The AIA for MBEs launched in April 2021, with four BIPOC-owned companies selected to participate in the first 12-week program.  \n### Community benefits agreement  \nIn January 2020, Turner announced that the City of Houston would negotiate a community benefits agreement (CBA) with RMC in response to concerns about community impact raised by individuals representing a variety of organizations largely concentrated in the nearby Third Ward, a neighborhood to the east of the Ion. The Ion's groundbreaking ceremony in July 2019 had also attracted students from Rice, Texas Southern University, the University of Houston and local high schools, who had formed the Student Coalition for a Just and Equitable Innovation Corridor to advocate for community benefits.  \nIn January 2020, representatives of 17 student groups wrote a letter to university president Leebron asking RMC to guarantee community benefits to local residents. Students asked Rice to collaborate with the Houston Coalition for Equitable Development Without Displacement (HCEDD), a group of community organizations, residents, and students concerned about the potential gentrification of the Third Ward, a historically and predominantly African-American community. The group tried to develop an exclusive and separate CBA with RMC which would not include the City of Houston as the counterparty.  \nAfter Turner and Rice agreed to negotiate a CBA, RMC and the City of Houston organized a workshop series which included a presentation of the district, a panel discussion of community experts, and breakout sessions for public input. Following the series, RMC convened a working group of civic and community stakeholders to help identify commitments to be documented in the CBA between Rice and the City of Houston. Stakeholders included representatives from Houston's Black and Hispanic chambers of commerce as well as residents of communities surrounding the district. RMC invited HCEDD to participate in the working group. After several months, the working group produced a report that recommended commitments for both Rice and the City of Houston in three focus areas of economic opportunity: housing affordability, inclusive contracting, and hiring. HCEDD, which did not participate in the working group after being offered four positions, criticized the working group's report and process saying the \"recommendations did not go far enough\".  \nHCEDD proposed an alternative set of commitments that included demands for RMC to construct affordable housing for \"existing and long-time\" Third Ward residents, support cultural preservation and sponsor of Juneteenth and Kwanzaa celebrations hosted by local groups. HCEDD also continued to demand an exclusive agreement with RMC which would not include the City of Houston. After the working group released its report, the City of Houston and Rice began negotiations and presented a proposed CBA to the City Council for approval that included $15.3 million dollars in direct community investments to affordable housing, community capacity building, and support for underrepresented entrepreneurs as well as project-based contracting and investment opportunities for minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) and underrepresented individuals.  \nThe proposed CBA was introduced to City Council for approval on November 3, 2021. The mayor was not present for the City Council meeting and six councilmembers initiated a procedural delay of the vote for a week. The following week, the Houston City Council approved the agreement by a vote of 14 to 3. According to the Houston Chronicle, the agreement includes a \"$5 million investment fund for minorities and women in tech, $4.5 million for affordable housing developers, and $2 million in technology sector job training\", among other community-focused initiatives. District K Councilmember and Vice Mayor Pro-Tem Martha Castex Tatum said the agreement sets a new precedent for community members and developers to work together in Houston and that it was \"more than any developer has ever done in the history of development agreements.\"  \n### Houston Coalition for Equitable Development Without Displacement (HCEDD)  \nThe Houston Coalition for Equitable Development without Displacement, also known as HCEDD, formed in October and held its first community meeting in November 2019 in pursuit of a community benefits agreement with Rice Management Company. The Ion's executive director at the time, Gaby Rowe, was invited to give a presentation on the innovation district and field questions before the public forums held by Rice and the City of Houston in September 2020. In addition to a CBA, student members of the coalition seek a Racial Equity Impact Assessment, as well as public transparency about Rice's community engagement efforts and neighborhood survey. Over the course of several months of public meetings, the coalition came to make up over twenty organizations, formed working groups, and elected a negotiation team. HCEDD has also held public workshops about the research behind the CBA process with Dr. Murtaza Baxamusa, known for his research on community benefits agreements.  \n### City of Houston  \nShortly after a January 20 open letter from a Rice student coalition demanding a CBA with the Houston Coalition for Equitable Development without Displacement and the introduction of a January 27 Student Association resolution, Mayor Turner on January 29 wrote to the president of Rice's Student Association that he has told Andy Icken, the city's chief development officer, to negotiate a \"CBA\" with Rice Management Company and coordinate community input. Such an agreement between a municipality and a developer is traditionally described as a development agreement rather than a community benefits agreement, which by definition must include a community coalition. The City of Houston facilitated online informational webinars alongside RMC in September and October 2020 on job-training, housing affordability, and hiring opportunities.  \n### Rice Student Association Senate Resolution #8  \nThe Rice University Student Association Senate passed a resolution on February 17, 2020, in support of a community benefits agreement process for the Innovation District. The resolution states that a CBA is \"project\u2010specific contract between developers or cities and community coalitions. CBAs are legally binding, enforceable agreements that call for a range of benefits to be produced by the development project. They allow community groups to have a voice in shaping a project, to press for community benefits that are tailored to their particular needs, and to enforce the developer's promises,\" and asks that RMC make HCEDD an equal party in the CBA negotiation process, as well as create processes for public openness and transparency. Allison Thacker and Ryan LeVasseur, RMC's president and director of real estate respectively, argued against the resolution, stating that HCEDD does not have legal authority to enter into a CBA contract and that the large coalition represents a substantive portion, but not the entire community. Students also shared that RMC \"threatened to disown the Student Association as a legitimate campus body if the SA Senate passed a resolution supporting the HCEDD as a signatory party in the CBA.\"  \n## Funding  \nRice Management Company has announced plans to invest $100 million in renovation for The Ion. The Ion falls within Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) #2, and RMC is seeking $75M in cost reimbursement from City of Houston taxes that are expected as a result of development on properties within the innovation district. The Ion falls within a Texas Census block group that is both a Texas Enterprise Zone and an Opportunity zone, qualifying it for certain financial incentives at the local, state, and federal levels. These can also result in tens of millions of dollars in cost savings for the developer through taxpayer subsidies over the course of a decade.  \n### Texas Enterprise Zone  \nEnterprise Zones are census block groups in Texas with a poverty rate at or above 20%. They are a way to collect various local and state incentives together to spur innovation in order to revitalize an area that is considered distressed. Local benefits may include but aren't limited to tax abatement, permitting fee waivers, publicly-owned buildings transferred below market cost, and low-interest loans. State benefits may include state sales and use tax refunds, depending on the level of investment and the number of jobs created.  \n### Opportunity Zone  \nThis federal program is also for areas that are considered distressed, providing tax benefits such as tax abatement to private investors in hopes of creating economic development and jobs in those areas. These census tracts were nominated by Governor Greg Abbott, seeking to address issues including risk of economic disrupters such as hurricanes, relatively low population density, and persistent unemployment. A 2020 report found that many opportunity zone beneficiaries are real estate investors who were likely to still do the development even without taxpayer subsidies, rather than companies that are creating jobs.  \n### Midtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) #2  \nOn August 26, 2021, the board of the Midtown TIRZ voted to approve an economic development agreement between the TIRZ and Rice Management Company. In exchange for leading construction and repair projects within the Innovation District, the TIRZ will provide $65 million in cost reimbursements for RMC's investment. Despite months of critical feedback requesting that the TIRZ require RMC to enter into a Community Benefits Agreement with a community coalition before approving the deal, six of the seven board members voted for the agreement. Board member Caton Fenz, CEO of ConnectGen, noted that the development may incidentally result in some affordable housing, however the agreement does not include any mention of affordable housing or any measures to address gentrification, particularly in the Third Ward community neighboring Midtown. The Midtown TIRZ has bought an estimated $72 million worth of land in Third Ward covering 4 million square feet.  \n### Academics  \nRice University's Glasscock School of Continuing Studies was the first school to announce coursework at the Ion, including data science and financial services.  \n### Tenants  \n* Aerospace Innovation Hub (NASA partnership)  \n* Baker Botts  \n* Chevron Technology Ventures  \n* Greentown Labs  \n* Microsoft  \n* Schlumberger  \n* Common Desk  \n### Recreation  \n#### Restaurants  \nThe district has the following restaurants either open or in development:  \n* Common Bond  \n* Late August  \n* Shipley Do-Nuts  \n* Stuff\u2019d Wings\n\nQuestion: Which former department store was renovated and transformed into the Ion, a central hub for coworking and office spaces, business incubators, and other facilities?\nChoice list: \nA.

It was a favourable depiction specifically of the English soldier, somewhat contrary to the official line that tried to emphasise that this was a British war rather than an English one. A review in The Times Literary Supplement noted that Thomas  \nIn 1918, Northcliffe asked Thomas to travel to the US. According to Thomas, the rationale for the trip was that \"he didn't know what the Americans were doing, and they did not know what we were thinking\". He met with influential people such as Henry Ford, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson during this visit.ps=none  \nWilliam Beach Thomas sometimes accompanied King George V and the Prince of Wales on their visits to France, noting on one occasion a situation he considered reminiscent of Henry II and Thomas Becket:  \nThomas's war work led to official recognition, as it did for many of the correspondents and newspaper owners; France made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920.ODNB In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE, which he too received: \"I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so much that I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency.\" This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.ps=none\n\n## Later years  \nAfter the war, Thomas stayed in Germany until 1919 and returned there in 1923 at the time of the Occupation of the Ruhr. He also undertook a tour of the world for the Daily Mail and The Times in 1922. His main focus returned to his lifelong interest in matters of the countryside, notably in his writings for The Observer from 1923 to 1956.ODNB Thomas was also a regular contributor of notes on nature, gardening and country life to The Spectator for almost thirty years, with some short breaks between 1935 and 1941, when H. E. Bates took over responsibility.ps=noneSpectator1957 In 1928 Thomas produced a history of the magazine under the title of The Story of the 'Spectator, in commemoration of its centenary.Times1957 He wrote many more books and articles in his later years, as well as two autobiographical books: A Traveller in News (1925) and The Way of a Countryman (1944).ODNB Fond of peppering quotations throughout his writing,Musty1985 his style was considered to be clear but his hand was poor; a profile of him in The Observer said \"perhaps he gave less pleasure to those who had to decipher his handwriting. Rarely has more limpid English been conveyed in a script more obscure.\"Observer1956  \nGeorge Orwell wrote in the Manchester Evening News:  \nEven as traditional English village life was in collapse, Thomas saw the romanticised paternalism and general life of the village as the epitome of English society and equivalent to anything that might be found elsewhere in the world. He said that one of the aspects of village life he admired was that \"comparative wealth there is admired, not envied\".ps=none He also viewed the natural world as something to be wondered at rather than scientifically examined. In his last column for The Spectator, written in September 1950, he wrote:  \nIn his desire to encourage a love of the countryside, especially during the Second World War, William Beach Thomas was similar to other writers on rural matters, such as G. M. Trevelyan and H. J. Massingham.ps=none He described Massingham as \"perhaps the best of all present writers on Rural England\" and considered him among those writers who were \"so fond of the past that they seem sometimes almost to despair of the future\".Musty1985 Malcolm Chase, a historian, says that these authors, including Thomas himself, advocated an ultra-conservative, socially reactionary and idealistic philosophy that formed an important part of a national debate about the future of the land and agriculture. This attitude was coupled with an increasing public interest in pastimes such as cycling, motoring and walking; it was supported by the publication of popular, fairly cheap and colourful articles, books and maps that catered both to those pursuing such interests and those who were concerned about conservation and the effects of the influx of urban and suburban visitors.ps=none John Musty, in his comparative literary review of the works of Thomas and Massingham, believes that Thomas had a more \"gentle touch\" than Massingham, whose writings have \"frequently been judged as narrow and reactionary\"; he quotes Thomas as saying of the likes of Massingham that they \"preach an impossible creed, albeit an attractive one\".Musty1985  \n<ImageHere>alt=Colour photograph\nMuch of one of Thomas's books, The English Landscape (1938), had previously appeared in various issues of Country Life magazine, and in part echoed concerns raised by Clough Williams-Ellis in works such as his England and the Octopus (1928). Williams-Ellis believed that building on greenfield land was too great a price to pay for socio-economic progress. Thomas argued in favour of protecting open spaces by creating national parks, for which he thought that the coastline would be the most suitable candidate. He stressed the relationship between the people and the land and saw a need for planning control to manage human ingress into areas that remained mostly untouched.ps=none  In 1934 he supported the Nature Lovers Association in its appeal to make the mountainous Snowdonia region, near the coast of North Wales, such an entity.NEP1934 He also supported the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society.WDP1934  \nIn 1931 Thomas lamented the inability of the National Farmers Union of England and Wales to hold up what he saw as the decline of the farming industry.WG1933 In A Countryman's Creed (1946) he harked back to a lost world, perhaps even a world that was more of his imagination than it was ever real. As F. R. Leavis had done before him, Thomas sought a rural revival to curtail what he saw as the rapid changes to traditional ways of life that had been evident in particular in the aftermath of the First World War and which were now ideologically challenged following the substantial victory of the socialist Labour Party in the 1945 general election. The new government was a threat to Thomas's view of the world because, in the words of the literary critic Robert Hemmings, it saw the countryside \"as merely a giant dairy and granary for the city\".ps=none  \nThomas was opposed to the use of the toothed steel trap for catching rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals, such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.NDJ1933\n\n## Personal life and death  \nWilliam Beach Thomas married Helen Dorothea Harcourt, a daughter of Augustus George Vernon Harcourt, in April 1900, and with her had three sons and a daughter. Their second son, Michael Beach Thomas, was killed in 1941 while serving as a naval officer during the Second World War.ODNB Helen survived her husband, who died on 12 May 1957 at their home, \"High Trees\", Gustardwood, Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire.ODNB He was buried in the village churchyard at St Helen's Church.ps=none Among the obituaries of William Beach Thomas were those published in NaturePitt1957 and The Times.Times1957  \n## Books  \nAside from his journalism, Thomas wrote and contributed to many books, all published in London and some also in New York.

Union of India & Another\n\n<ImageHere>Building of the Supreme Court of India\nIn 2017, the supreme court heard arguments for fifteen\u00a0days, beginning on 2 November2017 and finishing on 5 December2017. On 6 December2017, the court reserved its verdict on the matter.  \nThe Government of India (GoI) was represented by additional solicitor general Maninder Singh and former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) was represented by Indian National Congress member, former union minister and senior advocate P. Chidambaram, former solicitor general and senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, senior advocate Satya Mitra, former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Indira Jaising, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade.  \nFor GNCTD, Chidambaram argued that Delhi's lieutenant governor was not like a viceroy but just the president's representative and that his or her powers were dependent on the president's pleasure. Chidambaram also argued that per the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, the LG was \"required to act on the aid and advice\" of the council of ministers of the Delhi government. Subramanium argued that the Delhi government was not debating the parliament's supremacy but said the legislative assembly also had \"elbow room\" in Delhi's governance, adding that the LG was misusing the powers assigned to his or her office to refer differences of opinion to the president. He also said the LG's extraordinary discretion was to be used in exceptional circumstances and not in day-to-day governance of Delhi and that the chief secretary and other officers did not exercise volition on the government's welfare schemes and proposals but simply used them to mechanically defer matters for the lieutenant governor's disposition.  \nFor the GoI, Singh argued that the Delhi government's role was limited to that of municipal governance, backing his argument up by saying the Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Service and the Delhi Fire Service came under the GoI's jurisdiction rather than that of the Delhi government's. Singh also said that because Delhi did not have its own public service commission, it was not a state. Singh also argued that the GNCTD's executive powers were not binding on the lieutenant governor. Singh also said that because the Article239AA of the Constitution of India came under the section for union territories, Delhi was a union territory.  \nWhile hearing the case, the supreme court said Delhi's lieutenant governor had more powers than state governors, who were supposed to generally follow the aid and advice of the state chief minister-led council of ministers.\n\n## Judgment  \nThe supreme court ruled that according to the Article239AA of the Indian constitution, although the government had to keep him or her informed of its decisions, Delhi's lieutenant governor had no independent decision-making powers and had to follow the aid and advice of the chief-minister-led council of ministers of the Government of Delhi on matters the Delhi Legislative Assembly could legislate on, viz., all items on the State List (items on which only state legislatures can legislate) and the Concurrent List (items on which both the Parliament of India and the state legislatures can legislate) barring police, public order and land. The court added that on matters referred to him/her, the LG was bound to follow the orders of the president.  \nAlthough the court ruled that the lieutenant governor still had the right to seek the president's opinion in case of a disagreement between him/her and the government, the president\u2014who is bound by the aid and advice of the prime minister-headed Union Council of Ministers\u2014would be the final authority in case of a conflict, with his or her opinion being binding on both the LG and the Delhi government, it cautioned the LG to use this power only in exceptional circumstances and not in a \"routine or mechanical manner\". The court, however, did not define what \"trivial\" differences in opinion meant.  \nThe court also ruled that \"there is no room for absolutism and there is no room for anarchism also\" in the governance of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.  \nAt the same time, the supreme court\u2014citing the report of the Balkrishnan Committeeof1987\u2014ruled that although having a special status, Delhi was not a state; hence, unlike state governors, Delhi's lieutenant governor was not a mere constitutional figurehead but also bore the title of administrator.  \n## Reactions  \n<ImageHere>Delhi's chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, called the judgment a \"big victory\" for the people of Delhi and democracy\n\n<ImageHere>Naxalite type people\".\nThree-time Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, a member of  the Indian National Congress (INC), the largest constituent party of the United Progressive Alliance, said, \"if the Delhi government and the lieutenant governor (LG) don't work together then Delhi will face problems\". An INC spokesperson and a senior advocate, Abhishek Singhvi said the supreme court ruling was good \"in principle\", adding that there was no reason for the lieutenant governor to exercise discretion beyond his or her three reserved powers.  \nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary and politburo member Sitaram Yechury said there was no reason for governors and lieutenant governors to \"usurp the rights of elected\" governments, and that powerful governors and lieutenant governors appointed by the centre were in contravention with the constitution's federal structure. Former attorney general and a supreme court advocate Soli Sorabjee said the supreme court judgment was \"good\" and that the lieutenant governor and the Delhi government had to \"work harmoniously\", adding that regular confrontation between the two was \"not good for democracy\".\n\n\nQuestion: Which individual was involved in setting up a commission of inquiry to investigate an alleged scam in the Delhi & District Cricket Association?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Assess the delivered context and associated images, draw conclusions from the joint data, and respond to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Miniature painting depicting Pesaro in 1578\nWith the critical exception of John Palaiologos, the existence of other ancestors claimed by the later members of the Paleologus family can be verified through records at Pesaro. John's supposed son, Theodore, and grandson, Prosper, have been proven to be real historical figures. Prosper is documented as one of Pesaro's most prominent nobles in 1537 and is recorded as having been alive as late as 1580. Both Theodore and Prosper served Pesaro's ruling family, the Della Rovere family, in a military capacity. The records at Pesaro also prove the existence of a younger brother of Prosper, Guidobaldo Paleologus, who served as Capitan dei Porto in Pesaro, attested as such in 1578.  \nProsper had three known sons; Camilio (of which next to nothing is known), Leonidas and Scipione. In 1578, Leonidas and Scipione lived together with Camilio's young son, Theodore, and found themselves embroiled in a scandal as they were convicted for the attempted murder of Leone Ramusciatti, a man who was also originally of Greek descent. Having failed to kill Leone, the three Paleologi had barricaded themselves in a church in an attempt to avoid arrest. Documentation from Pesaro refer to the three as a something akin to a gang and allude to a previous (successful) murder conducted by them. The fate of Scipione is unknown, but Leonidas was executed. Theodore, who is referred to as a minor (he was probably 16\u201318 years old) was spared the death penalty and instead banished not only from Pesaro, but from the entire Duchy of Urbino.\n\n### In England and elsewhere  \n<ImageHere>left\nAfter being exiled, Theodore is next attested upon his arrival to England in 1597, there to kill a man named Alessandro Antelminelli, wanted by the authorities of the Republic of Lucca. At this point, Theodore had established himself as an assassin, and seems to have had an impressive reputation. Ultimately, Theodore failed to kill Antelminelli, and perhaps because he wanted a safer and more stable profession (he was around 40 years old), he stayed in England for the rest of his life, first entering into the service of Henry Clinton, the Earl of Lincoln. Clinton was almost sixty years old and one of the most brutal, feared and hated feudal lords in Britain. Clinton is frequently described as waging war on his neighbors and is often credited with rioting, abduction, arson, sabotage, extortion and perjury. At one point, Clinton even expanded his castle walls into the nearby churchyard.  \nWhile in Clinton's service, Theodore met his wife, Mary Balls, with whom he had six, possibly seven, children. When Clinton died in 1616, the fate of the family is unknown, but they were no longer present at the Earl's seat in Tattershall. Three years later, Theodore, Mary and some of the children lived in Plymouth, where Theodore in 1628 attempted to enter into the service of George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, who was almost as hated in England as the Earl of Lincoln had been. Villiers was assassinated soon thereafter, however, and Theodore was instead invited to stay with Sir Nicholas Lower, a rich Cornish squire, at his home in Landulph, Cornwall, called Clifton Hall. Clifton Hall was divided as to give place to two families, and Theodore was joined by his wife and some of his children.  \nWhen Theodore died in 1636, the family seemed to be well-off. He was survived by five of his children; the two daughters Dorothy and Mary and the three sons Theodore Junior, John and Ferdinand. Of the two daughters, only Dorothy married and she probably never had children. The fates of the three brothers were caught up in the English Civil War of 1642\u20131651. Theodore Junior supported the Roundheads, who meant to end absolute monarchy in Britain, and did not survive the war, probably dying of camp fever during the early stages of the long Siege of Oxford. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his grave still remains. The other two brothers were Cavaliers, or royalists, and fled the country during the war.  \nBoth Ferdinand and John were in Barbados, among the first colonists on the island, in 1644. John disappears from history soon thereafter, but Ferdinand stayed on the island for the rest of his life, becoming known there as the \"Greek prince from Cornwall\". He quickly became one of the elite on the island, cultivating cotton or sugar and possibly pineapples and was highly influential in the affairs of the local St. John's Parish Church. He constructed a great mansion called Clifton Hall, named after the family's home in Cornwall, which stands on the island to this day, recognized as one of the oldest and grandest great houses in Barbados.  \nFerdinand had only one known child, his son Theodore, who soon left Barbados, returning to England and becoming a privateer. He lived in Stepney, London and died at sea near A Coru\u00f1a, Spain in 1693. The only surviving child of Theodore, and the last known member of the family overall, was Theodore's posthumous daughter Godscall Paleologue, born on 12 January 1694. There are no sources on Godscall beyond her baptismal records and her subsequent fate is unknown.1995\n\n## Heraldry  \n<ImageHere>Coat of arms of Theodore Paleologus, as presented on his tombstone\nHeraldry in a West-European sense, permanent motifs transmitted through hereditary right, was never adopted in the Byzantine Empire. During the last few centuries of the empire's existence, a double-headed eagle symbol was increasingly associated with imperial power, with senior members of the Palaiologos dynasty typically using it as a personal symbol. The only preserved illustration of a coat of arms of the Paleologi of Pesaro is the depiction of one on the tombstone of Theodore Paleologus in Landulph, Cornwall. Theodore's coat of arms prominently displays a double-headed eagle, harkening back to the old emperors, but also incorporates two towers, the meaning of which is unknown. John Hall believes the towers to represent the gates of Rome and Constantinople. Above the double-headed eagle is an imperial crown.  \nThe arms on the tombstone also features a small crescent at the bottom. In English heraldry, such a crescent denotes someone as a second son, meaning that it is possible that Theodore had an older brother, but no older son of Camilio Paleologus is known. It is possible that the crescent was mistakenly added by Nicholas Lower, who commissioned the tombstone after Theodore's death.  \nThe shield on the tombstone is divided into two sections by a line behind the double-headed eagle, which indicates that it would have had two background colors. Since the tombstone itself is colorless, what these colors were is unknown. Hall believes that the colors may have been red and white, since these colors were prominently used by the Palaiologoi emperors.\n\n## Family tree  \nFollows Hall (2015).\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the Paleologus family and their claims of descent from the Byzantine imperial dynasty?\nChoice list: \nA.

In 1989 the business of Barton Transport was purchased.  \nIn 1998 Wellglade purchased the Kinchbus business in Loughborough. In January 2010 TM Travel of Sheffield was purchased. In January 2012 Wellglade took over the bus operations of Felix Bus Services.  \nIn December 2011 Tramlink Nottingham took over the running of the Nottingham Express Transit tram network. In April 2012 Centrebus Bowers Coaches operation and services operated from the Dove Holes depot of Wellglade's Trent Barton were combined to form High Peak Buses.  \nDuring September 2022, it was announced that current managing director Jeff Counsell will retire in February 2023 and will be succeeded by Tom Morgan who is the current commercial director for Wellglade Group.\n\n## Active Subsidiaries and Interests  \n### Trent Barton  \nTrent Barton operates services from Bakewell in the north to Coalville in the south as well as Ashbourne, Burton upon Trent, Chesterfield, Derby, Ilkeston, Mansfield, and Nottingham. It was formed when the Trent Buses and Barton Transport operations were merged.  \n### First Leicester  \nThrough their Trent Barton operations, Wellglade Group acquired a 6% shareholding of First Leicester in 1993, First Bus UK are the majority shareholder in the operations.  \n### Kinchbus  \nKinchbus is a bus operator based in Loughborough. It was originally an independent company established by Gilbert and Janet Kinch.  \nKinchbus operate some local services around Loughborough along with their Kinchbus2 route between Barrow-upon-Soar and Loughborough, Skylink from Leicester to Derby via Loughborough and East Midlands Airport.  \nKinchbus use the slogan 'Loughborough's Finest' which is advertised across their fleet of buses. Following the collapse of Nottingham based Premiere Travel on 24 January 2013, Kinchbus reinstated their service 9 between Loughborough and Nottingham which was the first route to have the new refreshed version of the current livery and logo which have been in place since 2007.  \n### Notts and Derby  \nNotts + Derby operates a small number of local bus services, school buses and contract and private hire work in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. They operate a fleet of vehicles, most of which previously operated with Trentbarton and Nottingham City Transport.  \n### TM Travel  \nTM Travel is a bus operator based in Halfway, Sheffield, operating bus services in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire. It was founded in 1995 as a family-owned operation with one bus.  School bus services and National Express services were later introduced.  The company moved into scheduled bus service operation in 1999, winning a contract from Derbyshire County Council.  A local route in Bolsover was launched a year later.  In 2004 TM Travel took over a route between Sheffield and Chesterfield previously run by Thompson Travel.  A number of South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive contracts were won over the following few years and the fleet increased in size to over 100 vehicles, prompting a move from Chesterfield to Halfway.  As of March 2008, TM Travel was the largest independent coach and bus operator in Derbyshire, employing 120 staff, with all operations (including maintaining the fleet of vehicles) handled in-house.  As of September 2017, the TM fleet consists of 66 buses.  The company was acquired by WG in January 2010.  \n### Nottingham Express Transit  \nIn March 2011 the Tramlink Nottingham consortium which Wellglade holds a 12.5% shareholding in, was awarded the Nottingham Express Transit 2 contract by Nottingham City Council. In December 2011 Tramlink Nottingham took over the running of the tram network.  \n### High Peak Buses  \nIn April 2012 Centrebus and Trent Barton entered a 50/50 joint venture. This saw Centrebus owned Bowers Coaches and Trent Barton's Buxton area services combined to form High Peak Buses based at the latter's Dove Holes depot.  \n### Kleanline  \nWellglade also owns cleaning service provider Kleanline.  \n## Inactive Subsidiaries and Interests  \n### Midland General  \nThe Midland General Omnibus Company was incorporated in 1920 as a company in the Balfour Beatty group with a depot at Langley Mill. In 1972 the company's operations were merged with those of Trent and the Midland General fleetname ceased to be used.  \nThe name was resurrected when Bargain Bus routes BB2 to Cotgrave and BB4 to Long Eaton were started in Nottingham in competition with Premiere Travel's services. These were withdrawn after Premiere Travel decided to withdraw their services.  \nThe Black Cat and Ilkeston Flyer services acquired from Felix in January 2012 were to be operated by Midland General. In practice buses of the Notts + Derby fleet operated both services and the Midland General name has disappeared from the timetables.  \n### Felix Bus Services  \nIn January 2012 Wellglade purchased some assets from Felix Bus Services. Felix already shared two routes with Trent Barton, these being Black Cat and Ilkeston Flyer.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\n<ImageHere>Steam Elephant (replica)\nTrevithick's first high-pressure engines from 1801 onwards, including his locomotives, used the return connecting rod layout in both horizontal and vertical arrangements. The cylinders were embedded within the boiler, to avoid heat loss, and the short boiler also formed the frame of the engine. This made the return connecting rod a natural layout, with the crankshaft at the opposite end of the boiler from the  crosshead. The paired connecting rods were relatively simple components, even though two were required. As they also allowed the crankshaft to use two simple overhung cranks on the ends of the shaft, rather than a complex forged crankshaft with an internal crank, this was also a valuable simplification.  \nOther early steam locomotives such as Murray's Salamanca (1812) and George Stephenson's Bl\u00fccher (1815) and Locomotion (1825) also used return connecting rod engines. These all had heavy vertical cylinders set in tandem within the boiler barrel, driving through transverse crossheads above the locomotive, supported by swinging links. The complexity of this motion led to it being named  'the knitting'  by drivers. The swinging link was simpler than Watt's earlier parallel motion and did not constrain the crosshead to move in such an accurate straight line. However the additional length of the connecting rods for a return connecting rod engine, relative to the piston stroke, made this angulation effect less serious. The Steam Elephant used a rudimentary set of slidebars to support the crosshead instead.  \nThe use of a return connecting rod to a shaft beneath the boiler with overhung cranks also avoided the need for an internal crank. For Stephenson's designs, this crank axle would also have carried the locomotive's weight, not being merely a crankshaft, and so this avoided a particularly difficult piece of forging work.  \nOne of the last locomotives to use return connecting rods was Ericsson and Braithwaite's Novelty at the Rainhill trials.  \nAbandonment of return connecting rod designs  \nHedley's Puffing Billy, a contemporary of Bl\u00fccher, avoided the return connecting rod in favour of a grasshopper beam. The cylinders were now mounted side by side, but were still large, heavy and mounted as an integral part of the boiler. Although a beam engine has a similar layout to a return connecting rod engine, in that the piston rod points in one direction and the connecting rod runs backwards from this, beam engines are not considered as return connecting rod engines. Stephenson's manager Hackworth's locomotive Royal George inverted the design to having the cylinders, still vertical, face downwards directly onto the crankshaft. By the time of Stephenson's Rocket, particularly as the new fire-tube boiler locomotives became lighter and faster, it was recognised that vertical cylinders caused hammer blow on the flimsy fishbelly rails of the time. Rocket was built with cylinders inclined at 45\u00b0 but was soon rebuilt to place them near-horizontally. Since then, almost all steam locomotives have had their cylinders placed close to horizontal.\n\n## Marine steam engines  \n### Paddle ships  \nCrosshead (\"square\") engine of the Hudson River steamboat PS Belle  \nThe first marine steam engines drove paddlewheels. Paddles require a relatively high axle, that often also forms the crankshaft. For stability the main weight of the engine, i.e. its cylinder, is mounted low down. Later engines drove single screw propellers. These now required a low-mounted drive, but still benefited from the stability effect of a low-set engine. Such early engines, constrained by the technology of the time, worked at low boiler pressures and slow piston speeds. Together with the short piston stroke constrained by lack of space for the engine,efn-lr|American sternwheel paddlesteamers used longitudinal horizontal engines that allowed a long stroke. These developed as long, small diameter engines of a distinctly different pattern from any other marine engines. In contrast, American sidewheel paddlesteamers favoured particularly tall upright steeple or walking beam engines. these early engines required large diameter pistons in order to develop enough power.  \n#### Crosshead engines  \nCrosshead, 'double crosshead' or 'square' engines were vertical engines analogous in layout to the table engine, with their cylinder above the crankshaft. The crosshead needed to be very wide, to allow the connecting rods to pass either side of the large cylinder, which in turn required a large supporting frame for the slidebars. They were popular for early American riverboats and their large wooden A frame crosshead supports were a distinctive feature. Larger engines became top-heavy and so the design was replaced by steeple or walking beam engines.  \n#### Steeple engines  \nEuropean practice, particularly on the Clyde, favoured Napier's steeple engine instead of the square engine. These were more complicated to construct and used more ironwork, but they placed the cylinder beneath the crankshaft and so were more stable in a narrow hull. Neither form was popular for sea-going vessels.  \n### Screw propulsion  \nIn marine practice, the return connecting rod engine for screw propulsion was termed the back-acting(US parlance)  \nor double piston rod engine.  \n#### Trunk engines  \nJohn Penn patented the trunk engine in 1848. This was a design to allow a particularly short engine (measured in the direction of its piston rod), that was also able to support a large diameter piston.A prevalent theory at the time was concerned about the effects of wear on the pistons of horizontal engines, owing to the weight of the piston. Pistons were thus provided with extensive support from their piston and tail rods, rather than allowing any weight to rest directly on the cylinder wall. They were mounted transversely, usually as two cylinder engines, and used for naval ships with relatively high installed power. A trunk engine achieves its short length by having a large diameter, hollow piston rod or 'trunk'. The gudgeon pin of the connecting rod is mounted inside this trunk, allowing the overall length of the two man components, the piston rod and connecting rod, to be telescoped together. As the trunk must be large enough to allow for the angulation of the connecting rod as the crank rotates, this design is limited to large diameter engines. It was also found that as boiler pressure increased, the large diameter seal around the trunk was increasingly prone to leaking.  \n#### Double piston rod engines  \n<ImageHere>Double piston rod engine of screw-driven 1865Cylinder and piston are to the right, condenser and air pump to the left.\nThe trunk engine was largely replaced by the double piston-rod engine.  This was a return connecting rod engine, with the crankshaft between the crosshead and cylinder. Four piston rods were used to pass around the crankshaft, both above and below, and also to each side of the crank, as the crank throw was wider than the vertical spacing of the piston rods. As most of these engines were parallel compounds, two piston rods would be taken from each of the HP and LP pistons. In some engines, double rods were used from the large LP cylinder and a single rod from the HP cylinder, with a yoke to pass around the crankshaft. Double piston rods could also be used from a simple engine, but these required an overhung gudgeon pin on the crosshead, so tended to be limited to smaller engines. An advantage of the double piston rod engine over the trunk was that both ends of the connecting rod were accessible for maintenance. One factor learned from naval use of horizontal cylinders was that, despite previous fears, there was little additional wear owing to the piston's weight resting on the cylinder.  \nAn Admiralty committee of 1858 recommended strongly that older engine designs be abandoned in favour of rationalisation on only three designs: the single piston rod engine (the most recognisable type today), the trunk engine and the double piston rod.  \nA later variant of the trunk engine re-visited the return connecting rod layout as the vibrating lever or half-trunk engine. This was a paired engine with two short-stroke trunk engines facing outwards. Their connecting rods from the pistons led to upright 'vibrating levers' that could rock back and forth. These levers rotated a short axle shaft with further levers on it that in turn drove another pair of connecting rods and a shared central crankshaft. These complex engines were the invention of the Swedish-American engineer John Ericsson and were little used outside these two countries.\n\n#### Maudslay's siamese engine  \nOther compact alternatives to the return connecting rod or trunk engines were Maudslay's siamese enginepage=96 and the rare annular piston engine. Like the trunk engine, these placed the gudgeon pin within the length of the piston stroke by having a pair of pistons and a T-shaped crosshead that could relocate the gudgeon pin behind its usual position.  \n### Builders  \n* Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes (later named Humphrys, Tenant & Co)  \n* Maudslay  \n* Penn  \n## Directly coupled pumps and blowing engines  \n<ImageHere>Vertical blowing engine\nA blowing engine is a large stationary steam engine directly coupled to air pumping cylinders. They are used to provide the air blast for blast furnaces and other forms of smelter. As the working cylinder and the driven load are both reciprocating pistons, they may be directly coupled by their piston rod. The connecting rod is only used to drive a flywheel whose inertia balances load through the cycle of the engine, not as an output shaft. These engines were some of the last new return connecting rod designs to be built.  \nThe large vertical blowing engine illustrated was built in the 1890s by E. P. Allis Co. of Milwaukee (later to form part of Allis-Chalmers). The air pumping cylinder is above the steam power cylinder and crosshead. The main force of the piston is transmitted to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth the action of the engine. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards.  \nSimilar pumping engines were also used in waterworks. Inverted vertical engines had their cylinder at the top and water ram pumps at their base, or in a borehole below them. A crankshaft and flywheels were provided in the space between these, for smoother running rather than rotary power output. These were driven from the lower (pump) yoke, by short return connecting rods. Two Worth McKenzie engines of this type; a triple-expansion engine on 1895 and a duplex simple of 1906 were installed at the Waterworks Museum, Hereford, Hereford and are preserved in steam there.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following images shows a steam engine layout where the cylinder is placed directly atop the boiler, as was the original layout for atmospheric and steam engines?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Review the provided context and related images, make deductions from the integrated information, and deliver answers to the questions asked.\nSydney Technical College in Ultimo c. 1890\nAs early as 1865 Selfe gave regular classes in mechanical drawing to tradesmen at the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts in Pitt Street. Selfe's class in mechanical drawing was the first technical, vocational offering at the School of Arts, and its popularity led to the introduction of other practical subjects.  \nDue to the colony's rapidly expanding population and demand for skilled labour, there were increasing calls in the 1870s for a formal system of technical education. In 1870, Selfe helped found the Engineering Association of New South Wales which amalgamated into Engineers Australia in 1919. He was its president from 1877 to 1879 and Engineers Australia annually awards the \"Norman Selfe Medal\" to a student at the Australian Maritime College. In 1878, the association joined forces with the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council and the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts to form the Technical and Working Men's College. The college initially operated as an agency of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts. The college occupied premises in Pitt, Sussex and Castlereagh Streets, and rooms in the Royal Arcade, before it moved to Ultimo in 1889. The college later became the Sydney Technical College out of which grew the University of New South Wales, the University of Technology, Sydney, and the National Art School. The Ultimo buildings still serve their original purpose, now as the main campus of the Sydney Institute of TAFE.  \nIn 1880, Selfe became vice president of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead for the establishment of a proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.\n\n### Critic  \nOn 1 August 1883 the New South Wales government made a proclamation which transferred control of the Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds to fit out workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.  \nMany of the board's initiatives were based on observations made abroad by Selfe and board president Edward Combes, or recommendations made by the British Royal Commission into Technical Education of 1881\u201384. However, most of the board's schemes were frustrated by an unresponsive colonial government. Norm Neill, historian of the early years of the Sydney Technical College, argues that the Board caused many of its own problems:  \nThere was a marked lack of unity\u00a0... Members either resigned or became inactive and the Board failed to accept that its autonomy was more nominal than real. Any expansion of technical education was dependent on government funding and governments were unlikely to allocate resources to an organisation unwilling or unable to cooperate.  \nSelfe was president of the Board from January 1887 until it was disbanded in 1889. During this time the relationship between the board and the government deteriorated with Selfe being overtly critical of two powerful institutions: the newly formed Department of Public Instruction and the University of Sydney. Selfe strongly opposed the government's taking control of technical education, which had been underway since the government first declared its interest in doing so at a special meeting of the Sydney Mechanics School of Arts in September 1883. He also did not support an alternative proposal that the University of Sydney should take over. In an address at the annual presentation of prizes at Sydney Technical College in 1887, Selfe alienated the Minister of Public Instruction and others by being openly contemptuous of the traditional pursuits of schools and universities:  \nThe whole experience of the past goes to show that the learning of the schools has had little, if anything, to do with the material advancement of the world, and that while it may have produced intellectual giants, subjective teaching has not brought forth those men who have been inventors and manufacturers that have entirely changed the character of our civilisation.  \nSelfe criticised the classical liberal arts education offered at the University of Sydney as elitist. In his 1888 address to Sydney Technical College students on prize night, he again caused affront to the establishment when he called for greater diversity of educational opportunities in the colony:  \nIt is not\u00a0... easy\u00a0... to see why the general public should pay so many thousands a year to make our future professional men in medicine and law in the colony, to form part of the so-called upper classes, when our \"principles\" will not allow us to pay just a little more in order to have, say, our locomotives made here, and when we are doing so very little, proportionately, to train and educate the artisans who make these locomotives, and who belong to a much less wealthy and influential level in society.  \nIn 1889 the colonial government, already in financial control, assumed direct operational control by abolishing the Board and placing the college within the Technical Education Branch of the Department of Public Instruction (now the New South Wales Department of Education).  \n### Reformer  \nIn the early years of the 20th century, education remained a major political issue in New South Wales. While Selfe would not be drawn again into the centre of the fray, he supported the efforts of his sister Maybanke and her second husband Francis Anderson towards education reform. Following the Knibbs-Turner Royal Commission into New South Wales Education in 1902, and the appointment of Peter Board as Director of Education in 1905, many of Selfe's ideas for technical education were implemented. Ultimately, in 1949, a separate Department of Technical Education was created, and the New South Wales University of Technology (later the University of New South Wales) was established at Kensington.  \nLes Mandelson, historian of Australia's education systems, categorises Selfe as \"a nineteenth century protagonist for the New Education\", who helped pave the way for the extensive reforms of the twentieth century. \"Without him\", he adds, \"education in the late nineteenth century would have been decidedly more mundane\". However, Mandelson sounds a critical note:  \nSelfe's contempt for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented\u00a0... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos\u00a0\u2013 indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion\u00a0... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised is that in the vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.  \nBiographer Stephen Murray-Smith is more generous in his assessment of Selfe's contribution to education debates around the turn of the twentieth century: \"Selfe went beyond the concept of helping the working man to achieve a share of the good things hitherto reserved for others, towards the concept of leading him to create good things for himself.\"  \nSelfe was a noted activist for the Federation of Australia being a member of the Central Federation League. Edward Dowling, his colleague on the inaugural board of the Australian Historical Society, was also the Secretary of the Central League of the Australasian Federation League and his former articled engineer John Jacob Cohen would later be elected at the 1898 New South Wales election in the seat of Petersham representing the National Federal Party.  \n## Personal life  \nWhen Selfe obtained a steady job after his apprenticeship, he brought his family with him from The Rocks to live at Balmain. Selfe bought waterfront land and built twin terraced houses called Normanton and Maybank, which are still at 21 and 23 Wharf Road, Birchgrove. It is likely that Selfe shared Normanton with his widowed mother. Next door lived his brother Harry, his sister Maybanke and his brother-in-law Edmund Wolstenholme.  \nSelfe was a supportive brother, both emotionally and materially. His sister Maybanke bore seven children to her first husband Edmund, four of whom died as infants from tuberculosis. He also provided financial support after Maybanke's marriage came to an end. Maybanke earned fame in her own right as a prominent suffragist and pioneer of education for women and girls. In the 1890s brother and sister campaigned together for education reform.  \nAmesbury, designed by Selfe and built in 1888  \nOn 10 October 1872 at St Mary's Church, Balmain Selfe married Emily Ann Booth, the daughter of John Booth, a well-known shipbuilder and Balmain's first mayor (and formerly the member for East Macquarie in the colonial parliament). They lived for many years at Rockleigh in Donnelly Street, Balmain, a house that has since been demolished. In 1884 their first daughter Rhoda Jane was born, followed by a stillborn daughter in 1886, and then Norma Catherine in 1888. In 1885 Selfe bought land in Ashfield and designed a grand house called Amesbury. Described at the time as having \"more novelties both externally and internally than any other house in the colony\" including terracotta lyrebird reliefs by artist Lucien Henry on the front wall, and a tower purpose-built for Selfe to pursue his hobby of astronomy. Built around 1888 to honour the centenary of the colony, Amesbury still stands at 78 Alt Street and was used by Brahma Kumaris from 1986 as its Australian headquarters until 2014 when it was auctioned for over $3.5 million. As children, Rhoda and Norma attended their Aunt Maybanke's school in Dulwich Hill. As adults, they trained in Italy with educator Maria Montessori and returned to Sydney to open a Montessori school of their own in the building known as Warwick on Bland Street, Ashfield.  \nAround 1894, the family moved, this time to Hornsby Shire, where a new Selfe-designed house, Gilligaloola, was built on ha purchased by Selfe ten years earlier. Situated at what is now 82 Pennant Hills Road, the house is still a local landmark, notable for its distinctive tower and twin chimneys. Selfe was a committed citizen and a natural spokesman for the local community, to the extent that when the railways needed a name for the locality, the community chose Normanhurst (though Selfe himself felt that St Normans would have been \"much more elegant and suggestive\").  \nOn 12 May 1906, four years after the death of his first wife, Selfe married Marion Bolton at St Philip's Church, Sydney.  \n### Death  \n<ImageHere>The Selfe-designed house Gilligaloola in which he lived from 1894 until his death\nSelfe died suddenly on 15 October 1911. His death certificate states the cause of death as \"heart failure brought on by exertion\". His daughter Norma offered some context to a journalist in 1957. She said:  \n\"On the day of his death he climbed trees in the church grounds to lop branches, as the gardener was too nervous to climb so high. That night he died in his sleep.\"  \nNorma reported that her father had been sanguine to the end, playful with his nephews and learning to play the oboe. However, other reports suggest that Selfe was concealing a bitter sense of disappointment at the end of his life, most particularly over the Harbour Bridge affair. His obituary in the journal Building concluded:  \n...\u00a0There is none today who can replace the noble personality, that keen energetic brain ever ready to give of its wonderful store of knowledge, and that happy spirit ever bright, ever optimistic, even though crushed beneath the cruel and unjust blow of the non-acceptance of his prize design for the North Shore bridge. \"It will crown my life\" he said. We will always remember the bright gleam in his eyes as they peered beyond the anxiety of today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called \"God's noblest waterway\".  \nSelfe's funeral was held at St Paul's Church, Wahroonga, where he had been a churchwarden. He was buried in Gore Hill cemetery in the presence of a large gathering of businessmen and representatives of the organisations he had been involved with. He was survived by his two daughters from his first marriage, Rhoda and Norma, and his second wife, Marion. His estate was valued for probate at nearly \u00a35000. Twenty-one years later, on 11 March 1932 Marion's charred body was found in her new house, also in Normanhurst where she lived alone, having reportedly set fire to her clothes when lighting a candle. Marion was buried alongside Norman in plot CE I:7. Rhoda's ashes were also placed nearby when she died aged 69 in 1954, still living in Gilligaloola.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following contributions is Norman Selfe known for, as depicted in the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\n<ImageHere>The 1933 Reichstag fire\nIn 1933 Bakker-Nort accepted an invitation from German communist leader Willi M\u00fcnzenberg to travel to London and join an international commission of foreign legal experts participating in a counter-trial of the arson case of the Reichstag fire. Five men, all communists, were about to go on trial in Leipzig, but it was feared the Nazis would not give them a fair trial. So, for one week, Bakker-Nort and the other acting judges went through the evidence and concluded that the defendants were innocent and the Nazis were behind the fire.  \nWhen the Leipzig judge invited committee members to the proceedings in Germany, Bakker-Nort declined. She denied allegations of bias by critics of the counter-trial and explained that she had taken part because the defendants lacked legal support in Germany, as many lawyers who had defended communists had been imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, deterring others. After the Leipzig trial found one of the defendants, the Dutchman Marinus van der Lubbe, guilty, and the Nazis executed him, Bakker-Nort lamented the unfair trial, particularly the unlawfulness of applying the death penalty based on a law adopted only after the Reichstag fire. She urged the Dutch people to value the freedom and justice that democracy provided and to fight all who aimed to curtail them.\n\n### 1934\u20131936  \nAs the economic crisis continued, the government intervened in the labour market. Where city councils previously had been allowed to fire female teachers who married, they were now required to do so. This erosion of women's rights was particularly painful for Bakker-Nort because it happened during the Second Colijn cabinet, of which the VDB was one of the coalition parties. She had tried to make the firing of married teachers temporary, but her amendment failed. According to Klijnsma, the VDB had made a mistake in not negotiating the protection of women's rights during the formation of the coalition.  \nAt a parliamentary budget review in 1935, Bakker-Nort condemned Germany's new marriage law, called the German Blood Protection Law, which banned Aryans, a now-obsolete historical race concept describing people of Proto-Indo-European heritage as a racial grouping, from marrying Jews. Both the Netherlands and Germany had signed the 1902 Hague Marriage Convention, which laid out the rules for recognising the validity of international marriages. The new German law caused the Dutch parliament to debate how to apply the rules of the convention to marriages involving German nationals. Bakker-Nort argued that because it was impossible to determine who was Jewish and who was Aryan, the rules of the treaty did not apply, and the Dutch would not have to revoke the convention's agreement. However, she asked Minister Josef van Schaik to revoke it anyway as a sign of protest. Van Schaik agreed with her that the German law would not apply to Dutch Jews but decided not to revoke the agreement.  \n### 1937\u20131940  \nBakker-Nort c. 1937  \nIn 1937 Bakker-Nort wrote a piece about fascism in the election issue of the VDB's monthly magazine entitled \"Democracy or Dictatorship\", in which she attacked the fascist party the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) in an unusually sarcastic way. For the 1937 election, the NSB used the image of its leader Anton Mussert and the slogan, \"Without this man, the Netherlands does not have a future.\" Bakker-Nort argued it should say, \"With this man, the Netherlands does not have a future, especially the women.\" The NSB won four seats in parliament, fewer than expected; the VDB retained its six seats and did not return to the new coalition government, the Fourth Colijn cabinet. The election results did not disappoint Bakker-Nort; she said voters had not punished the VDB and had understood why the party had to allow some women's rights to erode. In early 1938 Minister Carl Romme prepared a bill to ban paid work for married women altogether. This rejuvenated the feminists inside the VDB, both in parliament and in the local chapters. They were spurred on by the activities of the VVGS, whose youth committee's president Tendeloo and other feminists such as Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot organised protests across the country. Bakker-Nort said Romme pretended to base his exclusion of married women from the workforce on principle grounds that the husband was the breadwinner and the wife had to look after the family, but illogically did not apply this principle when companies needed the women. The feminists' efforts did not go unrewarded: Romme never introduced his bill. In a later debate on labour issues, Bakker-Nort asked the government to address the widespread sexual harassment to which female factory workers were subjected. In 1939 her husband Gerrid died.2013  \nThe late 1930s saw a rise in antisemitism in the Netherlands. The VDB attacked the NSB for condoning the Nazis' aggression toward German Jews during and following the Kristallnacht. They did, however, argue against the formal banning of the NSB, admitting that in a true democracy, even despicable voices should be allowed to be heard. Bakker-Nort said in 1938, \"We can not allow democracy to be murdered by its adversaries.\" When in early 1940, fear of a German invasion increased, parliament debated a possible new law for treason. According to her, Bakker-Nort argued against the death penalty; traitors should be deported. In May 1940, just days before the German invasion of the Netherlands, Bakker-Nort announced she would not stand again in the 1941 election, leaving it to the next generation. Party members suggested Tendeloo would be a good candidate. Her last day in parliament was 9 May 1940, when she debated the bill for the punishment of treason and espionage. The next day Germany invaded the Netherlands. Within a week, the Dutch were defeated, and the German occupation began. The House and Senate no longer sat, and the occupiers dissolved parliament officially on 25 June 1940.2013 Bakker-Nort had spent eighteen years in the House, addressing parliament mainly on the issues of justice, education, and labour, and for the majority of her stay, was on the Standing Committee for Private and Criminal Law.  \n## Imprisonment  \n<ImageHere>\"Work is liberating\" sign in the Theresienstadt concentration camp\nAs the German occupiers started to arrest and deport some Jewish Dutch citizens in the summer of 1940, Bakker-Nort must have felt threatened, according to Klijnsma. She had never belonged to a Jewish denomination and had renounced her Jewishness, but she did value Jewish traditions. In 1942, she was one of the few members of parliament who accepted an offer to resign and take their pension. However, this did not prevent her from being arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in the Westerbork transit camp in the northeast of the Netherlands in December 1942.  \nFollowing an intervention, possibly by VDB leader Dolf Joekes, Bakker-Nort was made part of Plan Frederiks and moved to Camp Barneveld in February 1943; Plan Frederiks was an agreement civil servant Karel Frederiks had made with the occupiers to keep a small group of Dutch Jews in the Netherlands and exclude them from deportation to the concentration camps. However, in April 1944, the Germans moved all Jews from Barneveld back to Westerbork and then in September 1944 onwards to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Bohemia in what is now the Czech Republic. After the defeat of the Germans, Bakker-Nort was found alive at the camp in June 1945 by a Dutch repatriation mission, together with 400 other Dutch survivors. She moved to Utrecht and did not return to parliament. Her seat for the VDB was taken by Tendeloo.\n\n## Death and legacy  \nSilent clip of Betsy Bakker-Nort in 1923  \nBakker-Nort died in Utrecht on 23 May 1946, aged 72. While the national newspaper Algemeen Handelsblad published only a short notice of her death, Tendeloo and former VDB chairman Pieter Oud wrote obituaries. According to Oud, Bakker-Nort had successfully accomplished the task Jacobs had given her: of leading the women's movement. He praised her drive to get women the vote, without the militant aspects of the English suffragettes, and her tireless efforts to reform marital law and labour laws. He urged the country's young women to realise how much they owed to the pioneers of the women's movement, of whom Bakker-Nort was one of the most prominent. In his 1968 memoirs, Oud wrote that her dedication to public office was equal to none and that although he did not consider her oratory skills the best, she quickly became a competent parliamentarian through her high work rate. Her successor Tendeloo was instrumental in ending married women's incompetency to act.  \nBraun wrote in 2013 that in the 21st century, Bakker-Nort is seen as a transition figure who was part of the first wave of feminism in the Netherlands that got women the vote but continued the fight for more rights. Once women's suffrage was achieved, the strength of activism had significantly reduced: member numbers for groups such as the VVS dwindled. The newly acquired right to study at university quickly became standard, and the fight was almost forgotten. Despite the political climate in the 1920s and 1930s being dominated by Christian parties that aimed to reduce women's rights based on their interpretation of the Bible, Bakker-Nort's efforts, in and outside parliament, were relentless.2013  \nIn 2003, many lost papers, notes, photos, pamphlets, and lectures that Bakker-Nort had kept resurfaced. At some point in the 1930s, she donated her documents to the International Archives for the Women's Movement in Amsterdam. The archives also housed personal documents of, among others, Jacobs and Rosa Manus and documents of women's organizations and journal issues. In July 1940, the Germans transported the entire archives to Germany. After the Soviet Red Army took Berlin in 1945, they moved all these stolen materials to Moscow. In 1992, the feminists' materials were identified in the Russian Military State Archives and recorded on microfilm, and ten years later returned to the International Archives of the Women's Movement. A lack of archives or access to them impacts how history is presented and whether women's stories can be uncovered. For example, the retrieval of the IAV records led to new biographies of Jacobs and Manus.2005a  \n## Publications\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects an event or action related to Bakker-Nort's career as described in the accompanying text for the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nAnt\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa (pictured in 2012) led for 15 laps until he and his teammate Alexander Sims made contact on the 26th lap, which he took responsibility for.\nWehrlein's suspension, diffuser, rear tyre bearing and rims were damaged when di Grassi misjudged his braking point for the first turn and rammed into him. An attempt  to continue driving proved impossible and he entered the pit lane to retire. Additionally, Paffett and his HWA teammate Vandoorne were unsighted because of smoke emitted from Vergne's spin, and the two made contact with each other's sidepods in the same area, causing Vandoorne to retire with a broken suspension at the end of the first lap and Paffett to sustain a slow rear-left puncture. Turvey moved from 16th to seventh by the end of the first lap while Vergne's spin dropped him to 19th and Buemi fell to 14th. At the start of lap two, Buemi passed Evans on the inside into turn one for 13th. Lotterer passed Evans soon after and then overtook Buemi into the turn-five and six chicane. On the third lap, a brief yellow flag was waved as Paffett spun exiting the chicane as the slow puncture deteriorated, causing him to retire. F\u00e9lix da Costa passed his teammate Sims on the inside line at turn three for the second position on the following lap. On lap seven, G\u00fcnther activated the attack mode, passing Dillmann, Vergne and Massa over the next four laps.  \nGunther's act confirmed to the field that the attack mode was a huge advantage without losing a large amount of time during activation, and a steady trickle of drivers activated the system over the following few laps. On lap ten, L\u00f3pez overtook Turvey on the inside for seventh before turn one. That lap, F\u00e9lix da Costa attempted to pass Bird for the lead on the inside into turn eleven, which Bird blocked and F\u00e9lix da Costa's right-rear corner hit Bird's left-rear quarter; both continued without any car damage. F\u00e9lix da Costa tried again going into the turn-four and five chicane on lap 11, and moved past Bird on the inside as the latter cut the corner under braking. Sims got an advantage to overtake Bird and took second on the straight entering turn eight. Abt used the attack mode to pass L\u00f3pez on the entry to turn one on lap 12 but L\u00f3pez responded by doing the same two laps later. On lap 14, d'Ambrosio went to the inside to pass di Grassi into turn seven for fifth. That prompted Virgin to allow Frijns to take third from his teammate Bird entering turn seven on lap 15. Bird blocked d'Ambrosio from overtaking him for fourth on the outside into turn eleven.  \nOn lap 16, di Grassi activated the attack mode, as d'Ambrosio successfully overtook Bird to move into fourth going into turn eleven, before the latter lost fifth to di Grassi on the start/finish straight. During the 17th lap, d'Ambrosio and d'Grassi got ahead of Frijns at turns seven and on the straight linking turns 10 and 11 to demote him to fifth. Di Grassi began to pressure d'Ambrosio as Bird activated the attack mode, falling to seventh behind L\u00f3pez on the next lap. Bird however immediately retook sixth from L\u00f3pez entering the turn four and five chicane. As the pack began to close up to the BMWs, F\u00e9lix da Costa and Sims activated their first attack modes on the 19th lap in an attempt to increase their lead. Frijns and Bird used their second attack mode activation on lap 23, with the two passing di Grassi at the end of the lap, motivated by Vergne moving to sixth. Furthermore, as he caught the battle for third, they were gaining on the BMWs, resulting in a lead change with ten minutes left.\n<ImageHere>Jerome d'Ambrosio (pictured in 2011) took the third victory of his career and his first on the track after his previous wins came as a result of driver disqualifications.\nAround this time, BMW Andretti team principal Roger Griffiths liaised with its senior engineering team to consider allowing Sims to pass his teammate F\u00e9lix da Costa for the lead because he was the faster driver and had better electrical energy management. Despite his team's liaison, Sims, approaching turn seven on the 26th lap, challenged his teammate F\u00e9lix da Costa for first on the outside as both drivers locked their brakes. This caused F\u00e9lix da Costa to slide wide and hit the front-left quarter of Sims's car, who had regained control; he could not avoid the former and their front wings interlocked. F\u00e9lix da Costa careened into a right-side tyre wall and retired. Sims made it through the corner, but fell from second to fourth. D'Ambrosio moved into first with Frijns second. To recover F\u00e9lix da Costa's car, the race director Scot Elkins ordered the safety car's deployment with seven minutes remaining. The safety car stayed on the track until only 20 seconds were left to run and Sims used their second attack modes beforehand to challenge Bird for third place.  \nOn the final lap, d'Ambrosio locked his tyres at the final corner and held off Frijns to win the race. It was d'Ambrosio's third career victory, his first since the 2016 Mexico City ePrix, and his first on-track win; his previous two came via technical disqualifications involving di Grassi. Frijns was 0.147 seconds behind in second and took the best finish of his career at the time, besting prior third-place finish in the 2015 Putrajaya ePrix. His teammate Bird finished third. Off the podium, Sims took fourth, Vergne completed his recovery to finish fifth and his teammate Lotterer sixth. Di Grassi finished seventh and earned one extra point for setting the race's fastest lap on the final lap, at 1-minute and 20.296 seconds. Buemi, Evans, and Abt rounded out the top ten. The final finishers were L\u00f3pez, G\u00fcnther, Mortara, Piquet, Rowland, Turvey, Dillmann and Massa.\n\n### Post-race  \nThe top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. D'Ambrosio was euphoric over taking his third career victory, \"This is a real win, I fought hard for it and I'm really happy. I've been here since the start of the series and I've been fighting to be in this position. Last year we had some tough moments and I'm happy I can pay the team back like this.\" Frijns said he regretted not challenging d'Ambrosio harder on the final lap. He commented on the importance of his second-place finish for the Virgin team, \"At one point, I was like, 'Shall I go for it at Turn 10?' and then I was like, 'Yeah, but we are P2, team-mate Sam Bird is P3 and I'm not going to be a bully that drives over Jerome and doesn't finish at all'. I think it's smart to not do it at the beginning of the season - just to score the points.\" Third-placed Bird said the camera from Vergne's car lodged in his vehicle possibly affected its handling, \"I didn\u2019t know too much about the move from Vergne at the start and from there on I suspect it may have caused a slight issue with the car as we didn\u2019t have the pace we had seen earlier. Nevertheless, it was an amazing result for the team and we did a great job in qualifying.\"  \n<ImageHere>Alexander Sims (pictured in 2009) attributed the clash with his teammate Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa to an inter-team communication breakdown.\nBMW Andretti personnel convened immediately after the race to discuss the collision with F\u00e9lix da Costa and Sims. F\u00e9lix da Costa apologised to the team, expressed contrition to the press, and conceded Sims was faster than him: \"I'm sorry - that's a mistake and a mistake coming from me only. It's terribly frustrating in this story because we lost a win, we lost a one-two, and even if it was just me, Alex could have won the race. But because of that, I denied him the win, denied the team a one-two. I'm feeling very bad for myself.\" Sims attributed the contact to an intra-team communication breakdown and refused to apportion blame. He additionally stated to the media he did not wish to challenge F\u00e9lix da Costa because he was conserving electrical energy and was attempting to maintain the gap over the rest of the field. Jens Marquardt, director of BMW Motorsport, said that any similar incidents would not re-occur in the future and the team would learn over the rest of the season. Griffiths later emphasised a priority scenario was non-existent over favouring one driver over the other and praised F\u00e9lix da Costa for accepting responsibility for the accident.  \nVergne called himself an \"idiot\" for clattering into Bird on the first lap, and stated any similar mistakes would not re-occur in the future: \"I didn't stop the car and I obviously didn't want to crash into Sam, I didn't want to ruin his race, ruin my race and have a penalty for the next race. So I went completely on the inside and obviously I spun because there was no other way. I either spin or take us both out - so I chose that option. It was unnecessary because I clearly had the pace to win today.\" Wehrlein said he was certain he could have finished on the podium had di Grassi not hit him at the start; he enjoyed the weekend as a whole, \"You know, I got to experience Formula E, apart from the race, but I like the formula and again the race was very interesting. It\u2019s a busy day with a lot of driving so I really like that as well but it starts early, I don\u2019t like it so much but you cannot have everything!\"  \nAfter the race, d'Ambrosio on 40 points took the Drivers' Championship lead from F\u00e9lix da Costa, who now tied with Vergne for second with 28. Lotterer moved to fourth place with 19 points and Frijns moved from twelfth to fifth. In the Teams' Championship, Techeetah continued to lead with 47 points; Mahindra moved from third to second, displacing BMW Andretti, which tied Mahindra with 40 points. Virgin's results progressed the team to fourth while e.Dams-Nissan fell to fifth with eleven races left in the season.\n\n### Race classification  \nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold.  \n* 2\u00a0\u2014 Pole position.  \n* 3\u00a0\u2014 Fastest lap.  \n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nTeams' Championship standings  \n* Notes: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.\n\nQuestion: Which driver made his Formula E debut for Mahindra and spent the week before the race at Mahindra's simulator in Banbury as part of his preparation?\nChoice list: \nA.

Differential diagnosis against influenza, chickenpox, Eczema herpeticum, Eczema vaccinatum and drug eruptions/erythema multiforme is necessary. The last smallpox case in Birmingham, UK, caused by a lab infection in 1978, was initially misdiagnosed by 3 physicians, leading to a significant delay in treatment and containment measures. This fact underlines the importance of an appropriate education and training of physicians to diagnose disease caused by bioterroristic agents as part of the preparedness plans.  \nWith smallpox in the media again after 2001, and noting that Parker had previously received two smallpox vaccinations, he became interested in how long immunity lasts in those who have previously been immunised. It led him to study and publish in 2005 an article on the Edinburgh smallpox outbreak of 1942, where six of the 36 cases of smallpox had received previous vaccination. The following year he published \"The history of smallpox\".  \nIn 2015, after 10 years in the post, he retired from his position as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.  \n## Awards and honours  \nGeddes is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. From 1996 to 1998 he was president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. The following year, the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy awarded him the Garrod Medal, following which he delivered its accompanying lecture. In 2009, he received Honorary Membership of the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. He received the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases award for excellence in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases in 2014. Subsequently, in 2015 he received the Hamao Umezawa Memorial Award (HUMA) Award.  \nHis recollections of 1978 inspired Mark Pallen to write The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham, published in 2018.  \n## Selected publications  \n* (Joint author)  \n* |volume=11|issue=2|pages=291\u2013297|doi=10.3201/eid1102.040609|issn=1080-6040|pmc=3320452|pmid=15752449|last1=Kerrod|first1=Emma|last2=Geddes|first2=Alasdair M.|last3=Regan|first3=Martyn|last4=Leach|first4=Steve (Joint author)  \n* (Joint author)\n\nQuestion: In which image did Geddes diagnose smallpox in 1978?\nChoice list: \nA.

Residents had to queue, sometimes for hours, in the sun to obtain necessities. None of the banks functioned for several days afterwards, and the Territory became a purely cash economy for a period of weeks.\n\n### Homeless  \nOnly 279 people were recorded as being provided emergency accommodation by the Government in the immediate aftermath. Although some unofficial estimates were higher, it was still a relatively small fraction of the overall population. Many of the surviving private dwellings were used to accommodate multiple families, which may have assisted the pressure on providing emergency accommodation.  \n### Balsam Ghut prison  \nFollowing the hurricane there was extensive damage to the prison, 90% of the buildings were damaged, most had lost their roofs and the perimeter fence was breached at several points. Prisoners eventually forced their way out, some returning that day. Although exact numbers were never provided, the authorities indicated that a number of the prisoners surrendered themselves voluntarily after checking on their families. All except two of the remaining prisoners were subsequently recaptured over the following days. Joint operations by both UK and local police assisted by the Royal Marines secured the prison and returned the vast majority of prisoners within seven days.  \n### High school  \nIrma damaged the Elmore Stoutt High School building, so students had to move to the former Clarence Thomas Ltd building in Pasea Estate. The students were divided into two shifts as the temporary building is not big enough to accommodate the students at the same time. Students in the morning shift are to go to after school programmes to keep themselves occupied.  \n### Department of Disaster Management  \nThe building which housed the Department of Disaster Management was almost totally destroyed in the storm. Accordingly, the relief and recovery efforts had to be coordinated from a conference room in Peebles Hospital.  \n### Looting  \nIn the days after the hurricane there were reports of looting of local businesses. This included not just food and medical supplies, but also non-essential consumer goods. The looting was brought under control when British troops arrived as part of the relief supplies.  \n## Subsequent weather events  \nFour days after Hurricane Irma passed, Hurricane Jose, a Category 4 hurricane, narrowly missed the islands.  \nEight days after Hurricane Irma passed, the Territory experienced torrential downpours of rain. Because the hills had been stripped of vegetation by the hurricane, this resulted almost immediately in extensive flooding of low-lying areas, including the capital, Road Town.  \n<ImageHere>The flooding of Road Town the week after Hurricane Irma.\nFourteen days after Hurricane Irma, the Territory was struck again by Hurricane Maria, also a Category 5 hurricane. However the eye of the storm passed to the south of Saint Croix, and the damage was minimal compared to Hurricane Irma.\n\n## Relief efforts  \nBy 8 September 2017, the UK government sent troops with medical supplies and other aid. The arrival of HMS Ocean, carrying more extensive assistance, was delayed and did not arrive for approximately two weeks.  \n<ImageHere>Royal Marines delivering aid on Jost Van Dyke.\nAfter the hurricane passed, entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, a resident of Necker Island, called on the UK government to develop a massive disaster recovery plan for British islands that were damaged, including \"both through short-term aid and long-term infrastructure spending.\" Premier Orlando Smith also called for a comprehensive aid package to rebuild the BVI. On 10 September, British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged \u00a332 million to the Caribbean region generally for a Hurricane relief fund.  \nAid distribution centres were set up in Cane Garden Bay, East End and Hunthum's Ghut.\n\n### Evacuations  \nIt took several days before Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport reopened for non-military traffic after the passage of the hurricane. Although it was only lightly damaged, communications equipment was destroyed, and the runway needed to be inspected and secured before allowing flight operations. In the seven days after it was reopened, a total of 1,597 (or approximately 5% of the population) was evacuated by airlift. The number of persons who evacuated by helicopter from private sites or by boat is not recorded.  \n### Curfew  \nAlmost immediately after the passage of the hurricane a state of emergency was declared and the Governor imposed a curfew. After one month, rather than extend the state of emergency, the Government passed the Curfew Act, giving the elected Government power to impose a curfew, which they did immediately. That civilian curfew then ended after a period of three months (after being gradually relaxed by degrees) and so the Territory operated under curfew for a period of three-months.  \nThere are no reliable records of a curfew having been imposed in the Territory in modern times, and there was no legal basis upon which one could have been imposed (absent either legislation or a state of emergency). Therefore, this was likely the first curfew imposed in the British Virgin Islands since at least the colonial era.  \n## Recovery  \nThe estimated damage to property in the British Virgin Islands was initially calculated to be US$3.6 billion. Although there were widespread reports of economic distress and redundancies in the aftermath of the hurricane, no reliable statistics or projections have been published. In the Territory's 2018 annual budget address, the Minister of Finance reported a 46% decline in tourist arrivals, and projected a 9.3% decline in Government revenues, and a contraction of 2.6% in GDP.  \n### Depopulation  \n<ImageHere>A ruined house in Road Town, Tortola after Hurricane Irma.\nIn May 2018 the Immigration Department of the British Virgin Islands announced that the population of the Territory has dropped by approximately 11% since Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the previous year.\n\n### Insurance  \n<ImageHere>Soper's Hole, West End, Tortola after Hurricane Irma.\nRecovery and rebuilding efforts in the Territory were hampered by low levels of insurance coverage. The Government itself had a policy of \"self-insurance\", and other than the Central Administration Complex, virtually none of its buildings or vehicles were insured.  \nPrivate homeowners also have relatively low levels of hurricane insurance. In previous natural disasters the Government has provided emergency assistance to residents, providing funding for repairs to homes that are uninsured. This created a moral hazard in that only uninsured homes were eligible for Government assistance, and incentivised lower income property owners to be underinsured or completely uninsured.  \nTo assist insured homeowners, the Government formed a temporary dedicated Insurance Tribunal to hear and determine insurance claims.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows the aftermath of Hurricane Irma where the Royal Marines are delivering aid?\nChoice list: \nA.

While not a park, the conservancy is frequented by resident and migrating wildlife including elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard and the more common plains game. Rarely seen in the parks but a common resident on the Conservancy is the lesser kudu.Making Conservation Our Business  \n### Mau Forest Complex  \nWithin Kenya's Rift Valley, sits the Mau Forest Complex. It is the largest indigenous montane forest in East Africa and serves as a critical water catchment area for the country, providing a source of water for many of Kenya's wildlife and people. African Wildlife Foundation, together with the Kenya Forest Service, the Community Forest Association, and other stakeholders, is reforesting areas of the Mau Forest with indigenous trees.  \n### Parc W  \n<ImageHere>West African giraffes near Kour\u00e9, Niger\nThis sqmi region is located around the point where Niger, Burkina Faso and Benin meet.  \nIt consists of three national protected parks that form a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the trans-national W National Park, as well as several adjacent reserves and buffer zones.  \nThe complex includes savanna woodlands, gallery forests and flooded plains where the Mekrou and Niver rivers meet.  \nIt is home to large and diverse wildlife populations including the largest population of elephants in the region and the only remaining West African giraffes.Parc W Landscape  \nMitochondrial and nuclear DNA research shows that this is a distinct and genetically healthy subspecies that diverged from the Rothschild's giraffe about 350,000 years ago.World's rarest giraffe  \nIn Parc W, AWF and other International NGOs such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature, World Wide Fund for Nature and Africa 70 play a central role in communication, education and organization of local communities and their leaders, and help collect socio-economic and technical data.Strategie Nationale  \nAWF is helping fund tree nurseries in Niger and Burkino Faso for replantings to provide fodder for the giraffes.Parc W Landscape Conservation threats are human population growth and desertification. AWF partners in the region include the Association pour la Sauvegarde des Girafes du Niger, Centre National de Gestion des R\u00e9serves de Faune (CENAGREF), Benin and the Ministries of the Environment in Burkina Faso and Niger.Parc W Landscape\n\n### Ruaha  \nThe Ruaha area will intersect with an agriculture corridor that the Tanzanian government wants to develop in southern Tanzania. The proposed corridor will overlap many different ecosystems, possibly undermining their ecological integrity and impacting wildlife areas. AWF is scaling up social venture capital investments through its subsidiary, African Wildlife Capital (AWC), which invests in socially and environmentally responsible agricultural and other businesses\u2014such as the Rungwe Avocado Co.\u2014that must comply with conservation covenants to secure and maintain investment. These AWC-invested businesses not only aim to benefit wildlife, but also benefit small-farm holders.  \n### Samburu  \n<ImageHere>Grevy's zebras in Samburu National Reserve\nThe national parks, private ranches, and communal lands of the Samburu Landscape support some of Africa's most impressive wildlife. The Grevy's zebra and reticulated giraffe, species that are found only north of the Equator in Africa, roam in the Samburu Landscape among the acacia grasslands. The unique conservation challenges faced in Samburu are forest/habitat degradation due to logging and farming and cattle-carnivore conflict.  \nAWF has implemented solutions to address these challenges, including partnering with Starbucks Coffee Trading Co. to train coffee growers in sustainable and more productive practices, providing wildlife scouts with monitoring technology, and working with Samburu warriors to protect endangered predators.\n\n### Virunga  \n<ImageHere>Mountain gorillas in Virunga National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo\nThe Virunga landscape is an area of volcanic highlands around the point where Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo meet, Virunga is home to the last 700 mountain gorillas in the world.  \nIt includes the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda, where AWF opened a visitor center in July 2006.  \nThe Virunga ecosystem is highly diverse, and also shelters chimpanzees, golden monkeys, forest elephants, and many species of birds, reptiles and amphibians.  \nThe region is overpopulated, intensely poor and politically unstable, placing severe threats on the environment.Virunga Landscape  \nThe AWF helped Dian Fossey study Rwandan mountain gorillas in the 1960s.  \nAWF President Robinson McIlvaine later said that \"There would be no mountain gorillas in the Virungas today ... were it not for Dian Fossey's tireless efforts over many years\".Celebrating AWF's 40th  \nMcIlvaine initiated formation of a consortium to protect the threatened Rwandan mountain gorillas while he was president of the AWF between 1978 and 1982.Robinson McIlvaine  \nMore recently, the AWF coordinated fundraising and construction of a lodge overlooking the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, home of about half the world's population of mountain gorillas.Clouds Mountain Gorilla Lodge  \nAccording to Farley Mowat in his book Woman in the Mists, in the late 1970s Fossey asked McIlvaine to temporarily serve as secretary-treasurer of the Digit Fund while he was AWF President.  \nShe had created the fund to finance patrols against poachers seeking to kill mountain gorillas. McIlvaine partnered with the International Primate Protection League, the Digit Fund, and his own AWF asking for funds, to be made out to the AWF.  \nThe Digit Fund received none of the money. When McIlvaine suggested to Fossey that the Digit Fund could be folded into AWF, Fossey declined and McIlvaine resigned as secretary-treasurer of the fund.  \nThe AWF is a co-sponsor of the International Gorilla Conservation Program (IGCP) in Virunga, the others being Fauna & Flora International (FFI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Among other activities, the IGCP works with Virunga Artisans, which markets handmade products of artisans who live near the Volcanoes, Mgahinga and Bwindi National Parks.About Virunga Artisans  \nA census of mountain gorillas in the Virunga Massif in March and April 2010 showed that there had been a 26.3% increase in the population over the past seven years, an encouraging sign that conservation efforts were succeeding.2010\n\n### Save Valley  \nThe Save Valley landscape was once dominated by a large livestock operation that pushed out native wildlife and degraded much of the ecosystem. During recent decades, cattle fences and livestock have been removed, and the landscape has seen a resurgence of wildlife and a recovery of the wild habitats.  \nThe Save Valley Conservancy, in Zimbabwe's southern lowveld area, forms part of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Lions, buffalo, leopard, elephant, and other game, including black and white rhinos, live in this area. AWF supports Save Valley Conservancy's anti-poaching efforts and works with government partners to ensure the protection of Save's wildlife, namely its rhino populations.  \n## Organization  \nThe African Wildlife Foundation headquarters are in Nairobi, Kenya with offices in South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Washington, DC.  \nThe organization is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  \nAs of 2009 there were 36 members of the Board and 132 paid staff.  \nFunds are raised through direct mail, grant proposals, Internet appeals, planned giving, cause-related marketing, and membership appeals.BBB Wise Giving...  \nThe executive heads of the foundation have been:AWF's History  \nThe AWF is a member of International Conservation Caucus Foundation's Conservation Council.Conservation Council It is also a member of EarthShare, a national federation that supports leading American environmental and conservation charities.Who We Support  \n## Citations  \n## General and cited references  \n* fix-attempted=yes\n\nQuestion: Which of the following African wildlife conservation areas is known for being the last refuge for the endangered mountain gorillas?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\n<ImageHere>Al-Burhan with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in October 2019\n\n<ImageHere>Al-Burhan with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Russia\u2013Africa Summit in Sochi on 23 October 2019\n\n<ImageHere>Al-Burhan with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in August 2020\nShortly after his appointment, al-Burhan ordered the release of all jailed prisoners who had been arrested by his predecessor, Omar al-Bashir, in a televised address.\n\n### Khartoum massacre  \nIn early June 2019, following al-Burhan's and Hemedti's visits to the Egyptian, UAE and Saudi leaders, the Sudanese Security Forces and Rapid Support Forces, including Janjaweed militias, led by al-Burhan and his deputy cracked down on peaceful protests in Sudan, starting with the 3 June Khartoum massacre. Human rights groups said that peaceful protesters were killed and about forty of the bodies were thrown in the river Nile, hundreds were tortured, violated and raped in the streets of Khartoum.  \nAl-Burhan's talks with the opposition on forming a combined government were then cancelled. During the days that followed, the TMC arrested several of the opposition leaders.  \nIyad el-Baghdadi interpreted the decision-making by the TMC under al-Burhan's leadership as being strongly influenced by the general context of the Saudi, UAE and Egyptian leaders being afraid of democratic movements. Mahmoud Elmutasim, a political activist and doctor who graduated from the University of Khartoum, similarly stated that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are opposed to the existence of democracies in the Middle East, since if \"the idea of democracy itself should ever take root, or become widespread in the Middle East,\" then it would constitute a threat to the governmental systems of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  \n### Internet shutdown  \nSeveral human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the al-Burhan-led TMC for shutting down the internet in June 2019. A spokesperson, Shamseldin Kabbashi, stated that the internet would be shut down for a long time because it represented a threat to national security. The move was described by HRW as a \"gross violation of human rights\". International media saw this as a sign of dictatorship and condemned the act. Many see it as an attempt to hide what al-Burhan's allied militia, known as the Janjaweed, were doing in Khartoum and  \nto delay uploading evidence of the violations that took place on 3 June 2019 and in the days that followed.  \n### Civilian government negotiations  \nIn May 2019, al-Burhan's first international trip was to Egypt to meet Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. His second visit was to the United Arab Emirates, where he met with the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Iyad el-Baghdadi, a human rights activist who became famous during the Arab Spring, later interpreted these visits (together with a visit by TMC deputy leader Hemedti to Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia) as encouragements for the TMC to cancel negotiations with the opposition. This comment by Iyad el-Baghdadi and recent developments and his ties to the Egyptian brotherhood which he established long ago when he studied in Egypt has led to the popular belief that al-Burhan has no interest to lead Sudan to a democratic and civilian state. Despite his promise to establish a civilian government by February 2021 as demanded by numerous protesters, his group seems to consistently isolate the civilian government led by Hamdok in key government decisions.  \nNumerous protesters asked for a civilian government. On Saturday 13 April 2019, al-Burhan announced that a civilian government would soon be established. Al-Burhan promised that the transitional period would take a maximum of two years. Negotiations started to take place with the opposition leaders to achieve this.  \n## Chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council (2021-present)  \n<ImageHere>Al-Burhan with Israel's Minister of Intelligence, Eli Cohen, in January 2021\nOn 25 October 2021, al-Burhan led the October 2021 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat to overthrow the civilian government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. On 21 November 2021, all political prisoners were freed and Abdalla Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister as part of an agreement with the civilian political parties. Hamdok was also allowed to return leading the transitional government.  \nOn 4 December 2021, al-Burhan told Reuters in an interview that the Sudanese military will \"exit politics\" following the elections scheduled for July 2023, stating, \"When a government is elected, I don't think the army, the armed forces, or any of the security forces will participate in politics. This is what we agreed on and this is the natural situation.\"  \nOn 9 December 2021, al-Burhan warned of possible measures against foreign diplomatic missions for their alleged incitement against the Sudanese army. He also reiterated his commitment to the political agreement struck with Prime Minister Hamdok in November 2021. On December 20 2021, al-Burhan voiced his support for Hamdok, adding that recent appointments had been made as the result of co-ordination between him and the prime minister and in line with the November 21st 2021 political agreement.  \nOn 31 December 2021, in a speech, al-Burhan said he was committed to \"building all the institutions of transitional government and holding free, fair, and transparent elections at their scheduled time\", in July 2023.  \nBoth al-Burhan and Hemedti had ties to Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia. According to Business Insider, \"The two generals helped Russian President Vladimir Putin exploit Sudan's gold resources to help buttress Russian finances against Western sanctions and fund his war in Ukraine.\" On 9 February 2023, al-Burhan met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.  \nOn 2 January 2022 Abdalla Hamdok resigned from his post of prime minister and Osman Hussein was sworn in as acting prime minister.  \nOn 4 July 2022, it was reported that al-Burhan mentioned the army will withdraw from the ongoing political talks and will allow political and revolutionary groups to form a transitional civilian government. This statement followed recent pro-democracy protests where 117 people were killed.\n\n### 2023 Sudan conflict  \nOn April 15, 2023, the country's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched attacks against al-Burhan's government, claiming to capture key government sites. Al-Burhan has claimed these sites are still under the control of his forces, and fighting is ongoing. As of 21 April, the clashes have continued, although with occasional ceasefires.  \nThe Sudanese military received support from Egypt. Egypt had sent soldiers and warplanes to Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The other rival, Rapid Support Forces had received support from Libya and United Arab Emirates as well as Russia's Wagner Group. The foreign involvement in the regional war could have a devastating effect on Sudan.\n\nQuestion: Which image shows Al-Burhan meeting with a US official?\nChoice list: \nA.

Formerly based at Elm Park, the club plays at the 24,161 capacity Madejski Stadium, named after chairman Sir John Madejski. After winning the 2005\u201306 Football League Championship with a record of 106 points, Reading F.C. spent two seasons in the Premier League before being relegated to The Championship. During their Premier League first season, they fractionally missed-out on UEFA Cup qualification.  \nReading Town Football Club, formed in 1966, played at Scours Lane and were playing in the Hellenic League Premier Division prior to folding in June 2016.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\n<ImageHere>Jan Charouz, Dominik Kraihamer and Thomas Holzer were selected to drive the No. 32 car by Lotus.\nDuring the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans weekend, Lotus publicly announced its T128 programme. The first picture of the car was made public on 1 August. Lotus planned to test the T128 in the first week of December 2012, but due to late part fitting, those plans were postponed to the third week of January 2013. That month, the team announced their intention to compete in the World Endurance Championship. Lotus also confirmed the return of Thomas Holzer and Kevin Weeda from the previous season. Less than a month later, the team re-signed James Rossiter and Vitantonio Liuzzi to drive one of the two T128s alongside Weeda. Lotus entered just one T128 for the pre-season test session at the Circuit Paul Ricard on March 28. Christophe Bouchut would share the No. 31 car with Liuzzi and Rossiter, and Dominik Kraihamer would share the No. 32 car with Weeda and 2009 Le Mans Series LMP1 champion Jan Charouz. During the various sessions, a ruptured oil tank limited the sole car's running for several hours before a replacement arrived and Rossiter drove some installation laps.\n\n## Racing history  \n### Season-opening European leg  \n<ImageHere>The No. 31 Lotus T128  being driven at the 6 Hours of Silverstone.\nLotus were expected to bring two T128s to the season-opening 6 Hours of Silverstone and changed the driver lineups of both cars. Weeda, Bouchut (in for Rossiter who was racing in the Japanese Super Formula Championship) and Liuzzi drove the No. 31 T128 and Holzer, Kraihamer and Charouz raced the No. 32 vehicle. Due to variable weather conditions, Kraihamer and Charouz qualified fifth on the grid in class, while Liuzzi and Bouchut qualified sixth. During the first hour, the No. 31 car was forced into the pit lane due to electrical issues, while Charouz and Nicolas Minassian's No. 49 Pecom Racing Nissan Oreca 03 entry collided.  \nLater, the No. 31 car's steering issues prevented it from finishing, and the No. 32 car's electrical problems prevented it from completing enough laps to be classified in the final results. Rossiter returned to Lotus for the season's second race, the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, and replaced Bouchut as one of the three drivers of the No. 32 car. Both cars started from the fourth row of the grid with Liuzzi and Rossiter's No. 31 T128 seventh and Holter and Kraihamer's sister No. 32 vehicle eighth. Due to alternator issues, both vehicles were slowed down in the race but were still able to finish in their respective class positions (albeit switched with the No. 32 in seventh and the No. 31 in eighth).\n<ImageHere>The No. 31 Lotus T128 at the 24 Hours of Le Mans showing the damage on its left-hand side and with the open left door.\nBouchut set the fastest time for the No. 31 car in the first qualifying session for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, placing him 15th in class, while Holzer secured 16th for the No. 32 car in the third (and final) qualifying session. Soon after, the No. 32 was relegated to the back of the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) grid for failing to have all three of their drivers set qualifying lap times within 110 per cent of the class leader's pole time. Weeda spun entering the second Mulsanne Chicane and beached the No. 31 car across the kerbs in the second hour due to the changing weather. The car pulled over at the side of the track after 17 laps and was declared retired four hours later with electrical problems. The No. 32 crew were impeded by the left door becoming loose twice and it later lost its rear body cover. Furthermore, the trio's lack of experience due to their young combined age and reoccurring engine overheating issues dropped the car down the order. In the 17th hour, a bell housing failure in the No. 32 car damaged its fitted auxiliaries, curtailing Lotus's race prematurely.\n\n#### Legal issues  \nLotus filed a lawsuit against Chosse, ADESS, and SCE Solutions on June 17 after learning that the team's owners, Romulus and Colin Kolles, were in debt. Choose filed a complaint in a French court, claiming that the owners of Kolles owed them \"a seven-figure amount\" in unpaid invoices. On June 18, Chosse responded, and at 17:00 local time, a bailiff seized the two Lotus T128s. Lotus presented fictitious invoices from ADESS, and on the afternoon of June 19, the Le Mans court decided in favour of Lotus. The court mandated that Lotus receive both vehicles back. 2018, the legal battle is ongoing,  \n### Podium in the Americas  \nFor the 6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rossiter was absent because of a Super GT commitment in Japan and Liuzzi was committed to racing in the Superstars Series, leaving Weeda and Bouchut to operate the No. 31 car as a two-person entry. Kraihamer and Holzer were among the top five in their class, while the second Lotus of Weeda and Bouchut were two places further back on the grid due to slower traffic. When Kraihamer lost control of the rear of the No. 32 car and hit the left-hand side of St\u00e9phane Sarrazin's faster No. 8 Toyota TS030 Hybrid, the No. 32 car's race ended early. As a result, both vehicles ploughed into the turn three outside tyre barrier. Both drivers were unhurt. Bouchut's No. 31 vehicle had gearbox problems from the start of the race and was forced into the pit lane. Bouchut was able to return to the track but the car was not classified in the final results.  \nLotus mechanics changed the No. 31 car's engine after practice for the inaugural 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas, the fourth since the start of the season, resulting in a three-minute stop-and-go penalty for the team. The No. 31 car set the sixth-fastest average LMP2 lap time in qualifying, and Charouz went into the rear of Sarrazin's No. 8 Toyota TS030 Hybrid as they approached the first corner, sending the latter car into a spin. Rossiter collided with Pierre Kaffer's No. 49 Pecom Racing Nissan Oreca 03 at the first turn of the race. Due to extensive damage to the suspension of the T128, Rossiter was forced to withdraw the car from the race. But Kraihamer, Charouz, and Holzer's No. 32 car finished third to earn the team's only podium result of the season.  \n### Season-ending races in Asia  \nAs the team concentrated on finding the ideal setup for the 6 Hours of Fuji, both Lotus T128s qualified for the race in dry and sunny conditions, starting in eighth and ninth places (the No. 31 car ahead of the No. 32 vehicle). Typhoon Wipha's passing brought heavy rain to the area, preventing any competitive action and limiting the overall race winner to only 16 laps behind the safety car. Hence, both Lotus cars finished the race eighth and tenth. Bouchut replaced Rossiter, who was unavailable due to a Super Formula commitment at the Suzuka Circuit, for the 6 Hours of Shanghai. The No. 31 car qualified seventh, while the No. 32 car started eighth. In the first hour, Holzer and Niclas J\u00f6nsson's No. 57 AF Corse Ferrari 458 Italia collided, damaging the No. 32 car's left-rear corner and forcing it into the garage. The other T128 retired due to engine failure while the No. 31 recovered to seventh in class.  \nWhile Rossiter was announced as returning to co-drive the No. 31 for the season-ending 6 Hours of Bahrain, he was unable to attend, and thus Lucas Auer, the Formula Three European Championship fourth-place finisher and nephew of former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger, filled his place for his debut sports car endurance race. On the LMP2 grid, the two Lotus T128s qualified seventh and eighth. In the first hour, Liuzzi collided with the No. 35 OAK Racing Nissan Morgan LMP2, sending the No. 31 car into the gravel trap. A few minutes later, Kraihamer made an error and collided with Richard Lietz's No. 92 Porsche 911 RSR left-rear corner. The Lotus stopped for 20 laps at turn ten before being declared a non-finisher due to heavy damage. Competing with the T128, the Lotus team accumulated 37 and 11 points for both cars, placing them seventh and eighth respectively in the FIA Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Teams. After the season, Lotus switched to the LMP1 class and replaced the T128s with the new CLM P1/01 car.  \n## Results summary  \n(key) Races in bold indicates pole position.

        "question": "Peruse the submitted text and corresponding images, infer from the cumulated information, and address the questions posed.\nalt=An adult Indian male wearing a black and white striped shirt.\nThe event opened with a tag team match between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) and the team of Alex Shelley and Michael Shane, who were accompanied by Traci. The duration of the bout was 11 minutes and 47 seconds. At one point, Storm lifted up Shane, so Harris could dive off the top rope and bash him in the chest with his forearm. Later, Storm was thrown out of the ring but held on to the top rope. He attempted to pull himself back in, however, Shelley dropkicked him from inside the ring, knocking him to the outside. AMW won the match after Storm pinned Shelley following a kick to the chin.  \nTNA held a Four Way match for the last spot in the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament between Elix Skipper, Mikey Batts, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. The competition lasted 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Elix Skipper performed his signature maneuver the Sudden Death on Batts near the end. He attempted a cover but was stopped by Shark Boy. Shark Boy then went for a cover, who was stopped by Dutt. Dutt then performed his signature aerial maneuver the Hindu Press, landing on Batts to gain the victory and enter the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament.  \nDavid Young and Simon Diamond fought Apolo and Sonny Siaki in the third encounter. It lasted 5 minutes and 32 seconds. Close to the end, Davidlifted up and slammed Siaki back-first into the mat with a Spinebuster. The referee refused to count the pin, deeming that David was not the eligible man. This allowed Apolo to lift up and slam David face-first into the mat to win the match.  \nIn the fourth match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris Sabin. Joe performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then placed Sabin in his signature submission hold the Coquina Clutch. Instead of submitting, Sabin instead passed out in storyline, with the referee lifting and raising his arm three times before giving the victory to Joe at 14 minutes and 2 seconds.  \nA Six Man Tag Team match between Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) and the team of Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were accompanied by Jimmy Hart, was next. The match duration was 14 minutes and 44 seconds. Douglas scored a near-fall after Hoyt slammed Eric back-first to the mat. The Naturals set up for their Natural Disaster tag team maneuver on Eric, however, Roode entered and bashed Douglas and Stevens with a megaphone. Eric then covered Douglas for the win.\n\n### Main event matches  \n<ImageHere>alt=An adult white male wearing black standing in a wrestling ring.\nThe sixth contest was a Tag Team Street Fight pitting the team of Monty Brown and The Outlaw against the 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings). A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification rules, which is won either by a pinfall or submission. The Outlaw requested to be called by a new name before the contest, Kip James. The Outlaw was busted open during the bout. Multiple referees had to be replaced for the match, due to reoccurring attacks on them by The Outlaw. Brown won the encounter after performing his signature Pounce maneuver on Killings, knocking him across the ring onto the mat, at 5 minutes and 20 seconds. After the contest, B.G. James entered the ring where The Outlaw offered James a chair to hit Konnan with, which James declined.  \nJerry Lynn was Special Guest Referee for the next encounter between A.J. Styles and Sean Waltman. Styles bleed from the nose during the match. Styles gained a near-fall on Waltman after performing his signature Styles Clash maneuver and slamming Waltman face-first into the mat. Waltman also gained a near-fall following his signature X-Factor maneuver and forcing Styles face-first into the mat. Later, Styles jumped from the ring apron over the top rope and Waltman in a sunset flip. Waltman held onto the ropes, trying to prevent a pin attempt, until Lynn kicked his hands off the top rope. Styles then rolled through and lifted Waltman up to perform the Styles Clash at 14 minutes and 37 seconds to win the competition.  \nThe TNA X Division Championship was defended by Christopher Daniels against Petey Williams, who was accompanied by A-1. The duration was 16 minutes and 24 seconds. During the match, Williams put Daniels in his Sharpshooter submission hold, which Williams was forced to release when Daniels grabbed the bottom rope. A-1 tossed Williams a chain to bash Daniels with. However, Daniels had his own chain which he used to punch Williams with and followed by performing his signature Best Moonsault Ever maneuver, splashing onto Williams, to retain the championship.  \nThe main event was a No Surrender Dog Collar match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the challenger Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that is attached to a dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat and ripped Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.\n\n## Reception  \nA total of 775 people attended No Surrender. Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett rated the entire event an 8 out of 10, which was equal with the 8 of 10 given to the 2006 No Surrender by Clevett. No Surrender's rating was higher than TNA's previous event Slammiversary, which was given a 7 out of 10 by Clevett. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's The Great American Bash PPV event held on July\u00a024, No Surrender was rated higher, as Bob Kapur gave The Great American Bash a 5 out of 10. Clevett felt that No Surrender proved that \"when everything clicks they TNA can put on a fantastic show that gives fans their money's worth.\" A.J. Styles versus Sean Waltman, Samoa Joe versus Chris Sabin, and the X Division Championship match were signaled out by Clevett as three \"fantastic matches on a solid undercard.\" Clevett gave his highest match rating of 9 out of 10 in his review to the Joe versus Sabin bout. He gave his lowest rating of 3 out of 10 to the Tag Team Street Fight. The main event, Styles versus Waltman, and the X Division Championship matches were all given an 8 out of 10 by Clevett. Regarding the Dog Collar match, Clevett thought it was a \"bloody and violent encounter, as one would expect with those two in the ring.\" When commenting on the Styles versus Waltman encounter, Clevett thought it \"was undoubtable Waltman's best match in years\".  \nWade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch rated the main event, Styles versus Waltman, and Joe versus Sabin all 3 and a half stars out of 5. However, the X Division Championship match received a 3 and a three-fourths stars out of 5, his highest rating of the review. He gave the lowest ranking to the Tag Team Street Fight, at a half of a star. Keller commented on the main event as being \"what you'd expect, and that's not a bad thing\". Keller thought the Styles versus Waltman bout was a \"very good match, the best from Waltman in years\". James Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch, published a review of the show. In his review he stated that the main event was a \"good car wreck match\", which \"told a good story based on the storyline entering the match\". Regarding the X Division Championship bout, Caldwell thought that \"both men worked a solid match\". \"A good wrestling match that showed Waltman still has it.\", said Caldwell as he commented on the Styles versus Waltman encounter. Caldwell believed that Joe versus Sabin was a \"damn good match\". TNA released a DVD counting down the top 50 moments in their history in 2007, with Rhino's debut listed at number 36.  \n## Aftermath  \n<ImageHere>alt=An adult Samoan male posing while wearing orange and black wrestling trunks.\nFollowing No Surrender, Raven went on to feud with Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Jarrett and Rhino attacked Raven on the July 22 episode of Impact!, claiming he had no allies to help him. On the July 29 episode of Impact!, Jarrett and Rhino attacked Cassidy Riley as well, until Raven announced he had chosen a partner to team with him in a Tag Team match to face Jarrett and Rhino at TNA's next PPV event Sacrifice on August 14. Sabu then appeared attacking Jarrett and Rhino with Raven. At Sacrifice, NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko added a stipulation to the encounter, in which if Jarrett pinned Raven he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, however, if Raven pinned Jarrett then he would not garner one for an entire year. The team of Jarrett and Rhino won the contest at the event, with Rhino gaining the pinfall victory.  \nAbyss began a feud with Lance Hoyt after No Surrender, when Abyss attacked Hoyt on the July 22 episode of Impact!. In return Hoyt attacked Abyss on the August 5 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Sacrifice. Abyss won the match at the event.  \nTNA held the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament in the weeks following No Surrender leading up to Sacrifice. It was a single-elimination tournament which involved eight men, A.J. Styles, Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Michael Shane, Petey Williams, Samoa Joe, Shocker, and Sonjay Dutt. The winner of the tournament would become number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship held by Christopher Daniels. Daniels provided commentary to each of the encounters on the July 22, July 29, August 5, and August 10 episodes of Impact!, as well as the Finals at Sacrifice. Daniels unofficially named the tournament the Christopher Daniels Invitational. The tournament came down to Joe and Styles in the Finals at Sacrifice, which Joe won after interference from Daniels.  \nSean Waltman and Jerry Lynn sparked a rivalry after No Surrender due to Lynn's interference in Waltman's bout against Styles, with the two facing at Sacrifice. The storyline revolving around this match began on the July 22 episode of Impact!, where Waltman accused Lynn of trying to steal his spotlight in a backstage segment, while Lynn took credit for Waltman's success in the industry for helping Waltman get his start. Lynn defeated Waltman at the event.  \nThe 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings) and the team of Monty Brown and The Outlaw fought at Sacrifice, this time with B.G. James as Special Guest Referee. Due to The Outlaw attacking several referees during the Street Fight at No Surrender, TNA officials refused to referee a rematch between the two teams at Sacrifice. As such, this forced Zbyszko to name B.G. as the Special Guest Referee on the July 29 episode of Impact!. The 3Live Kru were the victors at Sacrifice.\n\n## Results\n\nQuestion: Which wrestler was involved in a No Surrender Dog Collar match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the No Surrender event and successfully retained the title?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\n<ImageHere>J. Rand Capron rainband spectrum published in the second (1882) edition of How to Work With the Spectroscope\nJohn Browning was perhaps best known as the leading manufacturer of spectroscopes. His were considered to be of the highest quality in England. In 1865, he supplied photographer William Henry Fox Talbot (1800\u20131877) with a custom-made spectroscope. His crafting of fine spectroscopes strengthened his connection to the field of chemistry. In April 1872, Browning exhibited one of his spectroscopes at the Royal Society, more formally known as the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge. In his 1878 book How to Work With the Spectroscope: A Manual of Practical Manipulation With Spectroscopes of All Kinds, John Browning provided an overview of the field of spectroscopy, and the book became well known among spectroscopists. It has been published in a number of editions, most recently on 3 June 2010 by Cambridge University Press.  \nWhile the first edition of 1878 contained only black and white images, the second edition of How to Work With the Spectroscope included one notable colour illustration (pictured). It was of the rainband spectrum by lawyer and scientist John Rand Capron. It first appeared as a black and while image in Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine. However, the second, 1882 edition of John Browning's handbook reproduced the plate in colour. It demonstrated Joseph von Fraunhofer's solar lines A-F, with the rainband adjacent to the D lines. In the late 19th century, scientists were interested in the rainband for its potential in the detection of atmospheric water vapour and, therefore, the prediction of rain. Evaluation of the rainband represented the first attempt to use spectroscopy in the field of meteorology. Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth supported the contention that water vapour bands could be used to predict rainfall in the 22 July 1875 issue of Nature. While the topic of the rainband and its use in meteorology was controversial, John Browning (and his competitors) manufactured pocket spectroscopes designed to show the rainband and marketed them as meteorological tools.\n\n## Royal Astronomical Society  \n<ImageHere>Solar automatic spectroscope of John Browning, to be used with telescopes\nAn astronomer, Browning was also Optical and Physical Instrument Maker to Her Majesty's Government. As such, he supplied telescopes to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Browning also attached spectroscopes to telescopic equipment, garnering the attention of astronomical physicists J. Norman Lockyer and William Huggins. He was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1865. Browning was a pioneer in the manufacture of reflecting telescopes and bringing them to the attention of astronomers. As the popularity of astronomy grew during the 19th century, his business in telescopes flourished. An advocate of the Newtonian reflector, he was the author of A Plea for Reflectors, Being a Description of the New Astronomical Telescopes With Silvered-glass Specula, first published in 1867. By 1876, the book was in its sixth printing. Browning wrote many articles for the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, including a series on Jupiter's equatorial belt about 1870. Browning was a perfectionist, a trait that in at least one instance had unfortunate consequences. When he delayed in providing Lockyer with a spectroscope until it performed to his high standards, Lockyer missed the opportunity of being the first astronomer to observe a prominence on the uneclipsed sun. While the delay was only partially responsible for Lockyer's missed opportunity, there is evidence that Browning long regretted his reluctance to part with the spectroscope in question. Browning made a number of instruments for Lockyer, among them an 8-inch reflecting telescope that was delivered to Lockyer in 1871 and now greets visitors near the main door of the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth, Devon. Toward the late 1860s, in his quest to produce telescopes for a growing market, Browning collaborated with George Henry With (1827\u20131904), former schoolmaster at the Blue Coat School in Hereford. With was talented at producing high quality, large reflecting mirrors.\n\n## British Optical Association  \nDiagram of the eye in Our Eyes (1883)  \nBy the early 1870s, practical optics had become John Browning's primary interest, and he listed his occupation as optician on the census records from 1871 to 1901. He was well known among London's ophthalmic surgeons for his various ophthalmic instruments. Browning had a large part in reforming the art of crafting spectacles. Employees of his company tested people's eyesight and made eyeglasses for them. John Browning was the author of the book, How to Use Our Eyes and How to Preserve them by the Aid of Spectacles. Published in 1883, the book included thirty-seven illustrations, including a diagram demonstrating the anatomy of the eye (pictured). In 1895, he was one of the founders of the British Optical Association, the first professional and examining organisation for optometry. He was not only its first president, but also registered as its first member, so that many consider him to be the first professional optometrist.  \n## Other professional organisations  \nBrowning was also a member of The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain. In 1871, he constructed the first wind tunnel, located in Greenwich at Penn's Marine Engineering Works. It had been designed by another member of the Aeronautical Society, British engineer Francis Herbert Wenham. He was also a member of other scientific organisations, such as the Microscopical Society of London, the Meteorological Society, and the Royal Institution.  \n## Marriage and family  \nSt Mary the Virgin Church in Lewisham, Kent, c. 1811  \n<ImageHere>Church of Holy Trinity, Clapham\nBased on census and marriage records, John Browning married at least three times. In 1871, Browning lived in Richmond, Surrey with three unmarried sisters. Browning is identified as married, but no wife or child is recorded. His occupation is identified as \"optician, master (employing 61 workpeople).\" On 18 February 1874, a widowed Browning married widow Charlotte Hotten, n\u00e9e Stringer, at St Mary's Church in Lewisham, Kent. His wife Charlotte, a resident of Lewisham, was the daughter of William Stringer. Browning's father was recorded as William Browning (deceased). Both his occupation and that of his father were listed as optician. In 1881, John Browning was in residence at Croydon in Surrey. He lived with his wife Charlotte, sister Emma, and daughter Maria Browning, as well as stepdaughters Florence and Gertrude Hotten. John Browning's profession was listed as \"master optician employing 20 men.\" He was widowed in 1888, his wife Charlotte dying on 13 March 1888 in Croydon.  \nWidower John Browning remarried on 24 July 1890 at the Holy Trinity Church, Clapham, on Clapham Common London, at the time recorded as Surrey. He married Annie Woolley, a spinster whose place of birth and residence at the time of their marriage was Chapel Hill in Monmouthshire, Wales. She was the daughter of Josiah Woolley, a licensed victualler, and his wife Harriet Woolley. Her age was listed as 25 years old, thirty years younger than that recorded for her husband. Their marriage record and John Browning's death record are most probably responsible for the difference in dates of birth cited for John Browning in a variety of publications. The marriage record suggests that he was born around 1835, with a given age of 55 at marriage, while his death record suggests that his birth occurred about 1831. Browning's father was listed as William Browning (deceased), with his profession that of optician. John Browning's occupation was also listed as optician. In 1891, the year following their marriage, John and Annie Browning resided in Clapham, with his profession again recorded as optician. The Church of Holy Trinity, Clapham was added to the National Heritage List for England on 14 July 1955 as a Grade II* listed building.\n\n## Retirement and death  \nThe company of W. Watson & Son, opticians and camera makers, was founded in London in 1837. In 1900, that company took over John Browning & Co. From 1908, the latter company was known as Watson & Sons Ltd. By 1901, John Browning and his wife had moved to Bournemouth in Hampshire, and a one-year-old daughter Minnie was now part of the family. John Browning's occupation was listed as \"refractionist and optician (retired)\".  John Browning retired from his profession by 1905, and moved to Chislehurst on the outskirts of London, by some accounts. However, his obituary by the Royal Astronomical Society indicates that he retired to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He died in the registration district of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1925, with his death registered in the fourth quarter of the year. He was survived by his wife and his daughter, who was chief librarian at Bradford Library. Browning's widow Annie died on 18 February 1932 in Cheltenham.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about John Browning is supported by the provided images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

Their habits and affinities vary in many ways, but all practise parental care of their larvae in that they capture prey, usually insects, to feed their larvae. Whether solitary or social, most species construct some form of protection or nest in which they hide the prey and in which the larvae can feed and pupate in reasonable security.  \nMost solitary hunting wasps sting their prey in such a manner as to paralyse it without killing it. As a result it remains fresh for the young to eat. In contrast carnivorous social wasps generally feed prey piecemeal to the larvae as soon as they bring it back to the colony, so there is no need for preservation of the material. A minority of solitary hunting wasps, such as certain Bembicinae, also butcher their prey before feeding it to the larvae.\n\n## Overview  \nHunting wasp is not a biological taxon, but rather describes certain ecological strategies that occur within the Hymenoptera. All hunting wasps are members of the Aculeata, within the Apocrita, but not all Aculeata are hunting wasps.  Nor are the hunting wasps a single clade within the Aculeata; they almost certainly have evolved independently several times, sometimes probably several times within the same family.  Some superfamilies of the Hymenoptera (e.g. Chrysidoidea) include a few taxa that might fairly be called hunting wasps, but no superfamily includes only hunting wasps.  \n### Distinction between hunting wasps and \"solitary wasps\"  \nIn searching literature for \"hunting wasps\" it is prudent to include \"solitary wasps\" in the index terms. The two expressions have been used largely indiscriminately, especially in the very early days of modern entomology. Very few references to \"hunting wasps\" occur before about 1850, whereas references to \"solitary wasps\", though not plentiful, are not unusual.  \nCritically viewed, the terms are not strictly interchangeable. Not all solitary wasps are hunting wasps, nor are all hunting wasps solitary. The term \"solitary wasps\" simply describes those Hymenoptera (especially aculeate Hymenoptera) that are not social, particularly not eusocial. However, it never has been common practice to refer to parasitic Hymenoptera as \"solitary\", even though they definitely are nothing like eusocial, and secondly, some obligately social, even eusocial, Hymenoptera are hunting wasps in the sense of being predominantly predatory (e.g. Vespa and Polistes species). Thirdly, some solitary wasps, such as the Masarinae, are in no sense \"hunting wasps\". (But to avert confusion, consult the article on Euparagia.)  \n### Taxonomy and biology  \nThe taxa considered here are no more than a subset of those detailed in the article on the Apocrita. Nor are they listed here in the same sequence as in that article, but have been rearranged for convenience in discussing hunting wasp biology.  \nIn comparing the various hunting wasp taxa listed here, it is of fundamental importance to bear the following point in mind: supposing that members of one taxon exhibit adaptations to a given life history or biological strategy, and that another taxon has similar adaptations apparently more sophisticated, that need not in itself imply that either is descended from, or relevantly related to, the other. The reason for mentioning such taxa in close context is purely for suggestive illustration. Where the ancestral record of the more sophisticated strategy is unavailable, it often may be reasonable to observe that intermediate stages resembling the mechanisms of extant forms could be perfectly viable. For example, it seems plausible that a digger wasp such as a member of the Sphecidae might have had an ancestor that simply hid prey in available tunnels in much the same way that some Bethylidae still do, but it does not follow that the extant digger Sphecidae are descendants of the Bethylidae.  \nBearing this in mind, and that each of the superfamilies under discussion includes families other than those listed here, families that are in no way hunting wasps, consider the following, consulting the links and references for detailed discussion of the biology:  \n* Superfamily Chrysidoidea  \n* *Family Bethylidae  \n:The Chrysidoidea are not normally regarded as other than parasitoids, parasites, and kleptoparasites. Nor are they seriously considered as hunting wasps in this article, but some members of the family Bethylidae do have very suggestive patterns of reproductive biology. Though the details vary, these members of largely parasitoidal wasp taxa hunt their prey, paralyse them in various ways, including malaxation, drag them off, and conceal them before laying eggs on them. Many variations on the theme occur in the family.  Observation of such members of the Bethylidae provides material of great evolutionary interest. It strongly suggests that various forms of parasitoidal behaviour within the Hymenoptera independently provided preadaptation for the development of typical hunting wasp behaviour.  \n* Superfamily Apoidea  \nAlthough it had long been realised that bees were in essence a natural grouping of wasps that fed primarily on nectar and pollen, it took the development of molecular biology to demonstrate the actual grouping of true bees with the following families of definitive hunting wasps.  \n* *Family Ampulicidae  \nThese cockroach wasps are a popular example of a primitive mode of hunting wasp behaviour; they do not build a secure nest for their prey plus its egg, but conceal it in the most convenient crack or burrow, in which respect their behaviour resembles that of some of the Bethylidae.  \n* *Family Crabronidae  \nA very large family with varied habits and a wide range of prey species. Crabronid species in some taxa concentrate on flies, others on bees, others on cicadas, but the overwhelming majority build tunnels, whether single or branched, with one or more larvae inside.  \n* *Family Sphecidae  \nThese are a widely varied family, including the digger wasps and mud daubers  \n* Superfamily Vespoidea  \n* *Family Pompilidae (spider wasps)  \n* *Family Tiphiidae  \nThese are generally large wasps that hunt subterranean insects, usually beetle larvae. Commonly they do little to conceal the paralysed prey, but lay the egg on it underground.  \n* *Family Vespidae  \nAnother large and varied family. They include the social wasps such as paper wasps and hornets. These are hunting wasps in the sense that they hunt animal food, generally insects, but they do not subtly paralyse them; instead they more or less butcher them and carry the most nutritious portions back to the colony to feed the young progressively. Other Vespidae include the solitary potter wasps, that are classical examples of hunting wasps of the kind that build their nests out of mud. The Masarinae or pollen wasps are the major exception in the family in that they do not hunt at all, but instead feed their larvae pollen and nectar, as many members of the superfamily Apoidea do.  \n## History in literature  \nThe hunting wasps have long been known and have attracted the attention of generations of naturalists, but the term \"hunting wasp\" hardly appeared in literature published before the mid 19th century. Authors more often used the term \"solitary wasp\".  \nProbably the most notable early books on the subject were the French collections of essays by Jean Henri Fabre, which later were translated into English by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos in the early 20th century. There were earlier publications, usually informal, including some by deservedly prominent authors, such as the Peckhams, whose working lives overlapped that of Fabre.  \nHowever, most works before the late 19th century tended to be isolated observations and now require cautious interpretation of the species concerned, partly because most authors were amateurs, and partly because very little work had yet been accomplished along the lines of modern taxonomy. This is no reason to disrespect the authors of the time; even a century later, advances in molecular biology have led to an upheaval in Hymenopteran taxonomy that, however necessary, is a source of cognitive dissonance in workers brought up in the 20th century tradition, and who, for example, never would have thought of classifying hunting wasp taxa among the Apoidea.\n\nQuestion: Which image shows an example of a social wasp, rather than a solitary hunting wasp, engaging with its prey?\nChoice list: \nA.

Since Australia had lost to Canada by 7 points and defeated the Netherlands by 9, and the Netherlands had defeated Canada by 11 points, a tiebreaker on points differential gave Australia 9 \u2013 7 = +2, Netherlands 11 \u2013 9 = +2, and Canada 7 \u2013 11 = -4.  Canada therefore finished third, while Australia, tied with the Netherlands, was placed ahead of them based on defeating them in their match. As a result, the Gliders topped their pool, and received a quarterfinal berth against Mexico, which had managed to qualify despite only winning one game. Triscari was confident, but was not taking the match lightly. He cautioned the media: No game's easy, you know. We finished on top, so the crossover with the other side is in our favour. But they are by no means easy. We only beat Brazil by two points and Brazil only beat Mexico by two in the PanAm (Parapan championships) play-offs for third and fourth, so it's going to be tough.  \nThe Gliders planned to dominate Mexico early, playing as aggressively against them as they had played against the Netherlands. Australia's first shots at goal were taken by Kean from the free-throw line, but she missed both. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo then opened the scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, which turned out to be their biggest of the game. Gauci then put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders. Mexico turned the ball over, and Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Gauci, which was repeated on the next play, with Stewart providing the assist this time. Mexico scored, but the Gliders responded with another shot from Crispin. On the next play, Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Nott then took a defensive rebound, leading to Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled, but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Stewart drew another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14\u20134.  \nAmanda Carter in the match against Mexico  \nThe Gliders put Mexico under intense defensive pressure. Mexico had six team turnovers to the Gliders' one, and wound up with 19 turnovers in total to Australia's 6. Australia scored 18 points from turnovers, compared to 6 for Mexico. Gauci, a two-point player, took a three-pointer to take the score to 17\u20138. Mexico was unable to recover from Australia's high scoring from  Merritt, who ultimately scored 14 points with 70 per cent shooting, and Crispin, who scored twelve points with 67 per cent shooting. The teams went into the quarter-time break with the score 21 points to 10. Mexico fell further behind in the second quarter. Amanda Carter immediately stole the ball from Mexico, which let Merritt score two points. A few minutes later, Carter, assisted by Chaplin, scored a basket from the paint, and was fouled in the process. A successful free throw made the score 36\u201316. Another steal by Merritt led to a fast break, bringing her contribution to ten points, and the score to 38\u201316. At the halftime break, the score was 44\u201320.  \nIn the third quarter, a team turnover and a series of missed shots by Hill, Kean and Crispin allowed Mexico to outscore Australia by one point, leaving the score at 50\u201327 at the end of the quarter. The final quarter saw Australia's Del Toso miss a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal miss one at the other. Stewart also missed, before a Mexican turnover led to the first score of the quarter, by Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response. Another shot by Stewart missed, but Carter took an offensive rebound, and scored. Turnovers by Kean and Del Toso allowed Mexico to put four points on the board, but successive fouls sent Kean to the free-throw line to score three points in response.  \nMerritt brought the score to 59\u201335 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game drew to a close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to capitalise on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62\u201337.  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball \u2013 Quarterfinal \u2013 Australia vs Mexico \u2013 Statistics  \n### Semifinal \u2013 United States  \nReport:  \n<ImageHere>Match against USA. Amber Merritt takes a shot. Team USA's Rose Hollermann attempts to block.\nIn the semifinal, the Gliders had to beat the reigning champions, Team USA, in front of a small crowd of 4,428 at the North Greenwich Arena. Team USA had first possession and earned the first points of the game, but both teams' shooting was poor, and the score was only 10\u201312 at quarter time. The second quarter started with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14\u201312. Team USA turned the ball over to the Gliders several times, but they were unable to capitalise on their strong defence, leaving the score tied at 26\u201326 at half time. In the third quarter, an early goal by Gauci from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots, most of which they missed, but Team USA gave up a series of turnovers, and their shooting was worse than their rivals', resulting in a 10\u20130 run by the Gliders. Team USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Hill saw the Gliders leading 38\u201328. Team USA would ultimately post 28 turnovers to Australia's 17, and the Gliders would score 12 points from turnovers to Team USA's three. Triscari warned his players, \"They will come back! We have to stop them!\"  \nIn the final quarter, the Australian defence remained strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, who played the entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with four out of five attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40\u201339. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40\u201337 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, in the face of the Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball \u2013 Semifinal \u2013 Australia vs United States \u2013 Statistics\n\n### Gold medal match \u2013 Germany  \nReport:  \nThe Gliders would have to defeat Germany in front of a capacity crowd of 12,985 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal. Australia had narrowly defeated the German team 48\u201346 in the Gliders World Challenge in Sydney a few months earlier, and at that point had beaten them three of the previous four times they had played.  \n<ImageHere>Match against Germany. Sarah Stewart takes possession, watched by Germany's Annika Zeyen, Marina Mohnen, Gesche Sch\u00fcnemann, Edina M\u00fcller and Maria K\u00fchn, and Australia's Clare Nott.\nOnce again, Stewart took the opening tip. A defensive rebound by Kean after Germany missed two free throws resulted in the Gliders scoring first, with Gauci assisting Crispin. The Gliders used the same game plan that had defeated the United States, employing a strong defence against a normally high-scoring team.  At first, they were successful; with three minutes to go in the quarter, despite several missed shots, Australia was ahead 10\u20134. In the last minutes, Germany scored ten points that gave them a 10\u201314 lead at quarter time.  \nIn the second quarter, Germany extended their lead to ten points, but Kean scored a point from a free throw, and then, with seconds left on the clock, stole the ball, enabling Crispin to score, so the Gliders were only seven points behind at half time. The Gliders won the third quarter, but only by 9\u20138. They still had six points to make up, with strong defences from both teams. Gauci scored the most in this game, with 15 points, including a three-pointer, with five assists and four rebounds. In the end, the Gliders lost by fourteen points, 44\u201358.  \nTriscari felt that the Gliders did not put enough pressure on the Germans, and that their shooting was not accurate enough. In particular, they scored a dismal one point from twelve attempts from the free throw line. Basketball Australia CEO Kristina Keneally praised the Gliders' efforts. \"The Gliders have been nothing short of brilliant at the Paralympic Games,\" she said, \"and this Silver Medal is just reward for their outstanding performance. This is the Gliders' fourth consecutive Paralympic Medal\u00a0\u2013 a remarkable achievement. All of the players, coaches and support staff have done a fantastic job and we can\u2019t wait to greet them on their return home.\"  \nAmanda Carter and Shelley Chaplin with their medals  \nIn 2013, Keneally announced a four-year development program for the Gliders that included the appointment of a full-time head coach for the first time, based at the National Wheelchair Centre of Excellence at the New South Wales Institute of Sport in Homebush, New South Wales. In May 2013, Tom Kyle was appointed the Gliders' new head coach.  \n\"We have had the opportunity to play Germany a fair bit in our preparation so our game plan was to have strong defensive pressure and take it from there\", Kean told the media. \"It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more.\"  \nIt was not to be. The Gliders did not qualify for the 2016 Rio Paralympics after finishing second to China at the 2015 Asia Oceania Qualifying Tournament.  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball \u2013 Gold Medal Game \u2013 Statistics  \nSource: Women's Wheelchair Basketball \u2013 Statistics\n\n\nQuestion: In which image is the Australian wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders, playing against the Netherlands?\nChoice list: \nA.

Officials at Newark International Airport canceled all flights after 4\u00a0pm on October\u00a029, and flights out of New York's two major airports were delayed by up to five hours. Some flights bound for New York were diverted to Hartford. Several JetBlue flights departing from Bradley International Airport there were stranded on the tarmac for up to seven hours due to the hazardous conditions.  \nSome roads were also affected. Along the Jersey Shore, the nor'easter produced coastal flooding that left Ventnor Heights isolated. Officials closed a portion of the Black Horse Pike in West Atlantic City due to flooding. Further north, the flooding closed five New Jersey state highways in Monmouth and Ocean counties.\n\n### Sports  \nSporting events on Saturday, mostly college and high school football games, were also impacted. Penn State officials limited parking at its home game in State College to 1,500\u00a0spaces due to the inclement weather. It was the first Nittany Lions home October football game with measurable snow since record-keeping began in 1896. At West Point, New York, Army defeated Fordham 55\u20130 in its first home game played in snow since 1985. On Long Island where a windswept mixture of heavy snow and rain fell, a match between Plainview \u2013 Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School and Valley Stream Central High School was cancelled after 15 players were treated for hypothermia, prompting the former school district to reconsider game cancellation policies. At another football game on Long Island 10 players were checked and some treated for the condition.  Several players at Farmingdale High School reported extreme fatigue for several weeks following playing in the storm.  \n### Halloween  \nMany traditional Halloween activities were affected by the storm. In communities without electricity, where tree limbs and wires were down, trick-or-treating was delayed until days when it was expected to be back and repairs had made the streets safer. This also occurred in communities where electricity was still fully or partially on but the streets still may have been unsafe. In Sleepy Hollow, New York, a popular destination for the holiday since Washington Irving's classic short story, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is set there, Halloween events were canceled due to the storm and its aftermath. On the other hand, another popular Halloween destination, Salem, Massachusetts, location of the 1692 witch trials, was unaffected due to its minimal snowfall.  \n<ImageHere>alt=Children receiving small treats from a table with a shiny orange covering and two small pumpkins on it. One child to the right is in costume as a green turtle. There are adults behind them wearing heavy coats and hats. In the rear is a large brick building with snow on the roof\nSome families were able to compensate for the lost Halloween. They took their children to trick-or-treat in other communities that still had electricity. Residents of Glen Rock, New Jersey, organized a \"trunk-or-treat\" party at the local high school's football field, where children went around to parked sport-utility vehicles. Since many schools had snow days, and there was little to distract children without electricity, many parents insisted on going ahead with the holiday. \"You can't cancel Halloween,\" said a woman in Fairfield, New Jersey. \"The kids are all hyped up. They had no school because there's no electricity and this and that.\" A boy in Lexington, Massachusetts said he now planned to \"buy some candy and eat it myself.\"  \nAt UMass Amherst, the storm caused a power outage over a traditional party weekend at the college that lasted throughout most of the night on Saturday, October 29. While power was largely restored by Sunday, October 30, the campus canceled classes on October 31, and the UMass Campus Center served as a rest location for students and area residents who were still without power. Amherst College saw similar conditions, with the university newspaper reporting that students were taking refuge from power outages in Valentine Dining Hall, with one student describing the response as similar to hurricanes in her home state of Florida.  \nProposals in some communities to hold Halloween the following weekend, or whenever conditions returned to normal, met with protest from some parents. Some considered the October 31 date to be immutable and non-negotiable, so children would have to wait for 2012. \"I don't have control over the calendar, so Halloween is on Halloween, which is the 31st\", said Pat Murphy, mayor of New Milford, Connecticut. She noted the town had managed to celebrate the holiday that day on its village green despite considerable storm damage and continued power outages. Others had already allowed their children some trick-or-treating, and did not want them to indulge in candy a second time within the week.  \nMany school districts were forced by the storm to use up their remaining allotted snow days for the school year, after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee had required some be used near the beginning of the year. The Weston, Connecticut, public schools had already used nine snow days as of November 2, five more than its schedule allowed. Since more snow days would inevitably be used during the upcoming winter, they predicted that  vacation periods planned for later in the year would have to be shortened or canceled, or the school year would have to be extended.  \nThe storm came at a critical time for high school seniors preparing college applications for early decision, and 76 colleges and universities moved those deadlines back to compensate. In Connecticut, Weston High School, which had power, opened its library for students wishing to study or work on their applications; movies were shown in the auditorium.  \nalt=A satellite image of the northeastern United State. A swath of snow covers the ground from the Appalachians in western Virginia through Pennsylvania, northern and central New Jersey, the New York City metropolitan area and Hudson Valley into New England. There are patches of cloud on either side.\n\n### Electrical outages  \nApproximately 1.7 million customers in the Northeast were still without electricity three days after the storm. Temperatures in the region warmed up to above F during the day, but went down to near freezing at night. As powerless houses grew cold, residents bundled up and kept under blankets, went to stay or visit with others who had electricity, or used their car heaters to temporarily warm-up. Some, frustrated by long blackouts after other recent storms, considered leaving the region or moving to cities where power lines were underground.  \nAbout half a million households in New Jersey lost electricity, prompting a state of emergency declaration from governor Chris Christie. He had himself suffered outages both at his personal residence in Mendham and the governor's mansion, Drumthwacket, in Princeton.  \nIn Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy declared a state of emergency late on October\u00a029, after 830,000\u00a0people lost power, breaking the record set after Hurricane Irene. In the Danbury area, outages were so prolonged that seven school districts had to cancel classes for the following week. A state of emergency was also declared in Massachusetts, which allowed for the activation of the state's National Guard as well as other emergency measures. Due to the power outages and downed trees shortly before Halloween, at least three towns in the state advised delaying trick-or-treating. In New Hampshire, officials opened seven shelters for people who lost heating during the storm. The early snowfall allowed for the opening of ski resorts in Vermont and Maine.  \n<ImageHere>alt=A snow-covered road with one small tree down across it, in early morning light. On either side are trees, many still in leaf, heavy and bent with snow.\nAt a November 1 press conference, Governor Malloy estimated that damages in Connecticut would exceed $3 billion. Two days later, close to 700,000 homes and businesses remained without power. A week after the storm, almost 150,000 customers of the state's two utilities had not yet had power restored. Customers still suffering outages continued to cope as best they could, by sleeping at the homes of friends who had already had their electricity restored, taking showers at work and storing perishable foods outside. Power was not restored to all the customers who had lost it in the storm until November 9.  \nMany Connecticut residents were angry with the state's electric utilities, particularly Connecticut Light & Power (CL&P), which serves most of the state, for the long delays in restoring service. By the weekend after the storm, in comparison, most customers in other affected states had already gotten their electricity back. Malloy said they had \"missed their own target\" and ordered an investigation into their preparation and restoration efforts to be led by James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Clinton Administration. An Avon man complained he had not seen any crews in his area since the storm. Some commentators felt Malloy was being too lenient with CL&P, noting that the company had cut its maintenance budget in the preceding year and that smaller public utilities, such as that serving the city of Norwich, had experienced far less power loss and for far less time despite CL&P's customers paying the highest rates in the contiguous United States. Similar complaints had been made after the company had taken a long time to restore service after Hurricane Irene, and three weeks after the nor'easter, Jeff Butler, the company's CEO, resigned.  \nalt=An image showing a large bluish cloud over the Northeastern United States, with the deeper shades of blue representing the greatest snowfall  \nA month after the storm, Malloy released Witt's report, which concluded that \"CL&P was not prepared for an event of this size\". The utility had planned for a worst-case scenario in which 100,000 customers lost power, only one-eighth of those actually affected by the nor'easter. While the report noted that such a storm had not hit in 25 years when the company's emergency plan was drawn up in June, it nevertheless faulted CL&P for merely telling its emergency crews to be on call that weekend, instead of having them wait at predetermined locations. As a result, it was harder to mobilize them when the effects turned out to be far worse than they anticipated despite warnings from the NWS using terms such as \"historic\" and \"catastrophic\" prior to the storm.  \nThe report also said that CL&P did not ask for crews from neighboring states until after the storm, at which point other New England utilities were also seeking help from them. \"Because of that poor preparation, it's not surprising that they didn't, or that they couldn't, respond with enough boots on the ground when the worst-case scenario was compounded by a factor of eight\", said Malloy. The report did praise some aspects of CL&P's response, such as its short call wait times, speedy repairs by crews once they reached their job sites and the absence of death or serious injury among responding utility crews.\n\n\nQuestion: Which image shows an activity that some families used as a substitute for traditional trick-or-treating during a storm that disrupted Halloween celebrations?\nChoice list: \nA.

It is located at about 5\u00a0km from Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk and as the name says at the foot of a bigger mountain, the tuya of Geitahl\u00ed\u00f0.\n\n## Volcanism  \n### Eruption fissures of the Brennisteinsfj\u00f6ll volcanic system  \nDespite its location, just some 5\u00a0km from the high temperature area of Selt\u00fan, the volcano and its counterparts, the crater rows, fissures, as well as the tuya Geitahl\u00ed\u00f0  (385 m) with the crater \u00c6sub\u00fa\u00f0ir  on its top, are not part of the Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk volcanic system, but of the volcanic system of Brennisteinsfj\u00f6ll as its southernmost outpost.  \nEldborgir erupted about 2400 BP. The crater row also includes some lava channels. The lava at time of eruption run 2,5\u00a0km to the sea.  \n### The pyroclastic cones  \nSt\u00f3ra-Eldborg undir Geitahl\u00ed\u00f0 is a pyroclastic cone, built up mostly from spatter and scoria it forms part of a crater row.  \nAnother such eruption fissure is to be found nearby, therefore Icelanders prefer the plural Eldborgir undir Geitahl\u00ed\u00f0. One of the eruption fissures dissects the older tuya Geitahl\u00ed\u00f0.  \nThe Litla-Eldborg crater is part of the parallel crater row and eruption fissure. The eruption products of both fissures are petrologically different when compared. For this reason, it has been thought, that the fissures are not from the same eruption series.  \nLitla-Eldborg regrettablydate=July 2021 is rather damaged by quarrying.  \n### Tuya Geitahl\u00ed\u00f0  \nThe pyroclastic cones bear their name, because they are located very near to the tuya Geitahl\u00ed\u00f0 (386 m), and one of the fissures even can be seen dissecting the side of the older volcano. The tuya has its origin in subglacial eruptions under a Pleistocene glacier during a cold spell of the Ice Age. A Holocene crater is located up on summit plateau of the tuya which produced the lava field Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edkurhraun. It entered the sea to the south and formed the upper layers at Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edkurbjarg.  \n## F\u00f3lk tales  \nThe location is connected to the f\u00f3lk tale about the cousins Kr\u00fdsa and Herd\u00eds. The old women, who could use witchcraft, had a hefty discussion about the borders of their respective lands. One wanted to cast a spell so that all the fish in a nearby lake would be hairy, the other intended to bring up a storm and let all fishermen die. But this did not happen. Instead, the dispute ended with the death of both of them. The f\u00f3lk tale says that they were buried side by side and the place of the graves is still known to locals.  \n## Nature protection  \nThe crater and its surroundings were placed under nature protection in 1987  as a natural monument inside of Reykjanesf\u00f3lkvangur.  \n## Hiking  \nThere are some \u2013 partially marked - hiking trails on the eruption fissure, up to the rim of the St\u00f3ra-Eldborg-Crater and in the vicinity. Reynir Ingibjartsson  also proposes a tour up on the tuya through a small valley behind St\u00f3ra-Eldborg to visit the crater up on the tuya and because of the view over all of the south coast of Reykjanes as well as over other parts of Iceland's south coast up to Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.\n\nQuestion: Which image shows the scoria from the Eldborgir?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Evaluate the shared context and linked images, conclude from the collated details, and provide answers to the questions put forward.\n<ImageHere>Booker speaking with the media after delivering a speech to the California Democratic Party State Convention in 2019.\nIn May 2012, Booker defended Bain Capital's record and criticized Obama's attack on private equity. In response, the Republican National Committee created a petition called \"I Stand With Cory Booker\".  \nBooker is in favor of creating so-called \"baby bonds\", whereby newborns would be given low-risk savings accounts (managed by the Treasury) that would be worth tens of thousands of dollars by the age of 18. According to an analysis by Naomi Zwede of the Center on Social Policy and poverty at Columbia University, the baby bonds would almost entirely close the racial wealth gap among young people.\n\n#### Labor rights  \nBooker supports an increase of the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Speaking to Newark airport workers in May 2017 he said, \"It is un-American to be in this country, to work a full-time job and still live in poverty. That is unacceptable. The minimum wage working at a lot of these contract companies only affords them about $22,000 a year ... You cannot live and raise a family on $22,000 a year. You can't afford housing, you can't afford child care and since your company isn't helping you with retirement, you can't save for retirement.\"  \nIn June 2018, Booker was 1 of 8 senators to sponsor a bill amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to include a mandate forcing farmers to pay workers time and a half for each hour worked past the standard 40-hour work week.  \n#### Tech  \nBooker wants to see the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. \"We're being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars ...\" Booker said, \"and we cannot get left behind\".  \nIn stark contrast to Warren and Sanders, Booker invites Amazon to set up a major office (nicknamed \"HQ2\") in Newark, New Jersey.  \n### Environment  \nBooker has the most pro-animal welfare Senate-voting record according to the Humane Society. He is vegan and says that planet Earth cannot sustain First World meat-eating habits as prosperity spreads worldwide.  \nBooker backs the scientific consensus on global warming that it is man-made and is in favor of cap-and-trade or a carbon tax for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He backs the Green New Deal:  \nIn September 2018, Booker was 1 of 8 senators (along with Harris) to cosponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by Warren as using \"market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy \u2014 reducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\"  \nIn November 2018, Booker was 1 of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change.  \n### Foreign policy  \nBooker supports scaling down U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and is against intervention in Syria. After the US strike on Syria in April 2017, he criticized military action \"without a clear plan\" or authorization from Congress. He supports a two-state solution to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. On Iran, he has supported the Iran nuclear deal framework and has drawn criticism.  \n<ImageHere>Sign at the Women's March on Portland 2017, held the day after the Inauguration of Donald Trump.\n\n\n### Human rights  \nRegarding abortion, Booker opposes overturning Roe v. Wade.  \nBooker termed the President's military transgender ban \"deplorable and despicable\".  \n#### Discrimination  \nBooker advocates same-sex marriage and claimed New Jersey's civil union law was not only bigoted, but also discriminated against New Jersey's same-sex couples who were denied 1,100 federal rights, privileges and benefits afforded to married couples. After Governor Chris Christie vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in New Jersey and said the issue should be left to a public referendum of the people of New Jersey, Booker criticized him and said that civil rights are guaranteed by the US Constitution and should not be allowed on the ballot. As Newark Mayor, Booker refused to perform any weddings until same-sex couples were legally allowed. On October 21, 2013, the date when same-sex marriage became legal, Booker began performing same-sex and opposite-sex weddings.  \nIn November 2013, Booker co-sponsored and voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In January 2014, he co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act.  \nIn October 2018, Booker was 1 of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBT diplomats who had unions which were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBT individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that the US refusing to let LGBT diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of America upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"  \nRegarding racism, Booker tweeted that \"Black women are nearly 4 times more likely than white women to die as a result of childbirth\".  \n### Immigration  \nAmong Booker's stances on immigration, he believes immigrant detention should be eliminated to the extent possible. He has written that America needs to guarantee hormone therapy for transgender asylum seekers that have been detained.  \nRegarding immigration detention, a joint  letter dated June 2015 by 33 senators (including Gillibrand, Warren, and Sanders) criticized that as \"unacceptable and goes against our most fundamental values\".  \nIn July 2018, Booker was among 11 senators to sign a letter requesting the agencies responsible for reuniting families provide weekly updates, until every separated child was returned to their parents, in the form of a list of separated children, a list of their parents and other adult members of their families in addition to a list connecting the lists of children and parents and a briefing for the lawmakers on the strategies used to reunite families, and was 1 of 22 senators to sponsor the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act, which if enacted would prohibit immigration officers from detaining pregnant women in a majority of circumstances and improve conditions of care for individuals in custody.  \nIn January 2019, Booker was 1 of 21 senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill imposing a ban on the DHS from passing information collected on DACA recipients to ICE, CBP, the DOJ, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated.  \nIn a TV interview, he was asked what the people should do,  \nBooker opined that the federal government's inability to construct the Trump wall, for which president Trump declared a national emergency situation, is not an emergency.<ImageHere>Booker at a rally opposing the American Health Care Act of 2017\n\n\n### Health care  \nBooker supports holding pharmaceutical companies accountable when they \"gouge folks.\" He co-sponsored a bill that would take away patents if a company raises prices above what other countries are raising, allowing generic drugs to make the drug cheaper. In 2018 that introduced a bill that would \"shine a light into drug company payments to individuals with influence over the types of drugs preferred by states\u2019 Medicaid programs.\" He has been criticized for taking money from pharmaceutical executives and PAC's, accruing almost a half million in donations since 2013.  \n## Endorsements\n\nQuestion: Which policy proposal is associated with the individual in the provided images?\nChoice list: \nA.

In 1960, five different songs topped the chart, which at the time was published under the title Hot C&W Sides, C&W being an abbreviation for country and western.  Chart placings were based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores.  \nIn the issue of Billboard dated January 4, the song at number one was \"El Paso\" by Marty Robbins, the track's third week in the top spot.  It held the peak position for the first five weeks of 1960, during which time it also topped the all-genre Hot 100 chart for two weeks.  During the remainder of the year, only four other songs reached the top of the Hot C&W Sides listing, three of which each spent twelve or more consecutive weeks at number one.  In the issue of Billboard dated February 8, Jim Reeves began a 14-week unbroken run at the top of the chart with \"He'll Have to Go\", which was immediately followed by a run of the same length by Hank Locklin's \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\".  Both songs were produced by Chet Atkins, widely seen as the originator of the \"Nashville Sound\", a new style of country music which eschewed elements of the earlier honky-tonk style in favour of smooth productions which had a broader appeal.  Cowboy Copas next spent 12 weeks at number one with \"Alabam\". Several singles peaked at number two during these songs' extended runs at the top of the chart, including \"One More Time\" by Ray Price, which spent eight consecutive weeks in second place behind Locklin's song.  \n\"Alabam\" was the first chart-topping single for Copas and marked a comeback in his career, as prior to its success he had not entered the chart at all since 1952.  Nonetheless, it would be the only number one for the singer, who died in a plane crash in 1963.  \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" was Locklin's first number one since he topped the earlier Country and Western Most Played by Jockeys chart in January 1954, but like Copas he would not return to the top spot, even though he would remain an active recording artist into the 21st century.  The final country number one of 1960 was Ferlin Husky's \"Wings of a Dove\"; although he would continue to chart well into the 1970s, Husky would also not achieve another number one.  Marty Robbins, in contrast, would go on to achieve several more number ones, including 1976's \"El Paso City\", a sequel of sorts to his earlier song.\n\n## Chart history  \n<ImageHere>alt=A dark-haired man resting on a guitar\n\n<ImageHere>alt=A dark-haired man in a striped shirt holding a guitar\n\n<ImageHere>Jim Reeves spent 14 weeks at number one with \"He'll Have to Go\".\n}\n\n\nQuestion: Which artist had a 14-week unbroken run at the top of the Hot C&W Sides chart in 1960 with the song \"He'll Have to Go\"?\nChoice list: \nA.

It involves the preparation and drinking of sencha green tea, especially the high grade gyokuro type.\n\n## History  \n<ImageHere>The tea hall at Manpuku-ji in Uji, Kyoto\nTowards the end of the 17th century in the Edo period, Chinese merchants visiting Nagasaki showed how brewed tea should be drunk, as practised in the Ming dynasty court. This practise of the Chinese tea culture spread in the 18th century until the beginning of the Meiji era, particularly among literati merchants, in the form of friends meeting in a less formal atmosphere than the chanoyu. Appreciation of painting and literacy objects then took on particular importance. These meetings, often followed by genuine meals, were the opportunity to admire the host's collections, most often composed of objects imported from China or made in Japan in Chinese style called karamono.  \nIn difference to the preparation of matcha tea, which is powdered, sencha is prepared using small leaf tea.  \nSimilarly to the Chinese Gongfu tea ceremony, senchad\u014d has a codified form of preparation, presentation and enjoyment of tea.  \nIn spring 2020 the Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum in cooperation with Meiji-mura held a large sencha exhibition about Kimura Teizo, an outstanding art collector born in Nagoya. He was already collecting works by %E7%86%8A%E8%B0%B7%E5%AE%88%E4%B8%80 at the age of 25 and became patron of the arts.

She enabled the foundation of the first museums in her birthplace of Genoa, the Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Bianco as well as the lt=Galliera Hospital and the San Filippo children's hospital. A statue of her by Giulio Monteverde stands in the hospital gardens.\n\n## Life  \n### Family  \nBelonging by birth to the House of Brignole-Sale, one of the most prestigious aristocratic families in Genoa and one which had produced several doges, she was born in the city's Palazzo Rosso to Antonio Brignole Sale, 11th Marquess of Groppoli and his wife Artemisia Negrone. Antonio's mother Anna Pieri had been a lady-in-waiting to Napoleon's second wife Marie Louise, whilst his sister Maria Pellegrina had married duke Emmerich von Dalberg, second only to Talleyrand in the French diplomatic corps.  \nAntonio too became a diplomat, taking his daughter to several European capitals and bringing her into contact with major figures of the era. Her parents' fervent Catholicism also instilled strong moral values which emerged when she had to decide how to use her huge fortune, since she had no heir to pass it onto. Maria's younger sister Luigia married the Duke of Lodi, it.  \n### Marriage  \nAged 17 she married marquess Raffaele De Ferrari (namesake of the main square in Genoa, piazza De Ferrari), making her by marriage Duchess of Galliera (a dukedom granted by the Pope in 1837) and Princess of Lucedio (granted by the King of Italy in 1875) and gaining her many lands and their coats of arms. Their early married life was marked by Raffaele accidentally killing a servant whilst intent on cleaning a firearm. The inquest returned a verdict of accidental death but Raffaele was so disturbed by the event that he immersed himself in his work, which took them to Paris. There he made his fortune in banking and the early French railway industry, thus hugely increasing his and his wife's already large fortunes. He disliked Paris but remained there on his wife's encouragement, she having fallen in love with the city's social life.  \n### Paris  \nThe H\u00f4tel Matignon, now the official residence of the French Prime Minister.  \nFollowing the French Revolution of 1848 and Louis Philippe's death in 1850, the royal family sold off their properties to avoid bankruptcy. De Ferrari thus acquired the H\u00f4tel Matignon at 57 rue de Varenne from the Duke of Montpensier in 1852. Renamed the H\u00f4tel Galliera, this 18th century building had the largest private park in Paris and had been the residence of Maria's ancestor Maria Caterina Brignole-Sale (1737\u20131813), princess of Monaco. Maria herself called it \"comfortable so long as one did not have children\" and her husband little by little furnished it with the Brignole family art collection, starting with portraits by Anthony van Dyck and Hyacinthe Rigaud.  \nThe house's sumptuous parties and eminent guests are still noteworthy. As a personal friend of the former royal family of Bourbon-Orleans, Maria assigned some of them parts of the house during the difficult years of the Second French Republic and the Third French Republic until all the family members had left France. Maria left the house to the Austro-Hungarian Empire to house its French embassy before she left Paris for good \u2013 it was confiscated by France in 1922 as war reparations and since 1933 has been the official residence of the country's prime minister  \nThe couple's first child Livia died in 1829 before her first birthday, whilst their second child Andrea (1831\u20131847) died at a young age. Their third child Filippo (1850\u20131917) became an eccentric stamp-collector and found relations with his mother strained by her nostalgia for his two dead siblings and her sympathy for new socialist ideas. He chose to assume Austro-Hungarian citizenship and became an officer in that nation's army, renouncing most of his parents' wealth and titles and dying without issue.  \n### Philanthropy  \nPalazzo Rosso  \n<ImageHere>Villa Brignole Sale (Voltri). Photograph by Paolo Monti, 1964.\n\n<ImageHere>Mus\u00e9e Galliera, fashion museum in Paris\n\n<ImageHere>View of the orphanage in Meudon.\nRaffaele had in the meantime become senator of the Kingdom of Italy in 1858 and \u2013 now effectively without an heir thanks to Filippo's decisions \u2013 he decided to devote himself to public works and philanthropy, giving 20,000,000 lira to improve the Port of Genoa, money which also funded the construction of several other pieces of infrastructure, most notably the Galliera, Lucedio and Giano jetties. Raffaele died in 1876 and his widow continued his philanthropic activity as well as that begun by her father Antonio. As well as the \"Galliera\", \"S.Andrea\" and \"S.Filippo\" hospitals, sited around an old Franciscan nunnery, she founded a fourth, the \"San Raffaele\" in the city's Coronata district.  \nIn 1874 she donated Palazzo Rosso to the city and also left it Palazzo Bianco in her will \u2013 they became two of the three sites of the Strada Nuova Museums. In Paris she also built a palace to house her family art collection, but when the French government confiscated all the lands and buildings of the Orleans family, Maria decided to leave that palace to the city of Paris without the artworks, which she instead housed in Palazzo Rosso \u2013 the palace in Paris now houses a costume and fashion museum. She also built an old people's home and orphanage, both in Meudon near Paris, costing a total of 47,000,000 francs and both still in operation.  \nShe died in Paris and a special train took her body to Voltri for burial beside her husband in the crypt of the Sanctuary of Madonna delle Grazie, which he had acquired from the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1864 to return it to its original Capuchin owners, from whom it had been confiscated through the laws of that kingdom. The Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera in Voltri was left to a charitable \"opera pia\" \u2013 since 1931 it has been used and part-owned by the city council of Genoa. Since her son Filippo renounced his titles, the title of Duke of Galliera passed to the Duke of Montpensier, last surviving direct descendant of Louis Philippe, childhood friend of her son Andrea \u2013 it is still held by the Spanish Orleans branch. The dormant title of Marquess of Groppoli, which she inherited but never claimed, passed to her cousin Baron Acton.\n\n\nQuestion: Which of the following philanthropic contributions was made by Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Observe the assigned text and related visuals, deduce from the unified details, and reply to the queries presented.\nAt\nadjusts for the consumption of substrate over the course of the reaction, so only rate changes due to catalyst loading will be observed. A linear dependence on catalyst loading for a given conversion is indicative of a first order dependence on catalyst at that conversion, and one can similarly imagine the non-linear plots resulting from higher order dependence. Changes in the linearity or non-linearity from one set of conversion points to another are indicative of changes in the dependence on catalyst over the course of the reaction. Conversely, changes in the linearity or non-linearity of regions of the plot conserved over multiple conversion points (i.e. at 30, 50, and 70%) are indicative of a change in the dependence on catalyst based on the absolute catalyst concentration.  \nCatalyst interactions with multiple components of a reaction mixture can lead to a complex kinetic dependence. While off-cycle catalyst-substrate or catalyst-product interactions are generally considered \"poisonous\" to the system (certainly the case in the event of irreversible complexation) cases do exist in which the off-cycle species actually protects the catalyst from permanent deactivation.  \nIn either case, it is often essential to understand the role of the catalyst resting state.\n\n## Same-excess experiments  \nThe variable parameter of greatest interest in reaction progress kinetic analysis is the excess (e) of one substrate over another, given in units of molarity. The initial concentrations of two species in a reaction may be defined by:  \nB0 = A0 + e  \nand, assuming a one-to-one reaction stoichiometry, that excess of one substrate over the other is quantitatively preserved over the course of the entire reaction such that:  \nBt = At + e  \nA similar set can be constructed for reactions with higher order stoichiometry in which case the excess varies predictably over the course of the reaction. While e may be any value (positive, negative, or zero) generally positive or negative values smaller in magnitude than one equivalent of substrate are used in reaction progress kinetic analysis. (One might note that pseudo-zero-order kinetics uses excess values much much greater in magnitude than the one equivalent of substrate).  \nDefining the parameter of excess (e) allows for the construction of same-excess experiments in which two or more runs of a kinetic experiment with different initial concentrations, but the same-excess allow one to artificially enter the reaction at any point. These experiments are critical for RPKA of catalytic reactions, as they enable one to probe a number of mechanistic possibilities including catalyst activation (induction periods), catalyst deactivation, and product inhibition described in further detail below.  \n### Determining catalyst turnover frequency  \nPrior to further mechanistic investigation, it is important to determine the kinetic dependence of the reaction of interest on the catalyst. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst can be expressed as the reaction rate normalized to the concentration of catalyst:  \nTOF = sfrac|v|Cat  \nThis TOF is determined by running any two or more same-excess experiments in which the absolute catalyst concentration is varied. Because the catalyst concentration is constant over the course of the reaction, the resulting plots are normalized by an unchanging value. If the resulting plots overlay perfectly, then the reaction is, in fact, first-order in catalyst. If the reaction fails to overlay, higher-order processes are at work and require a more detailed analysis than described here. It is also worth noting that the normalization-overlay manipulation described here is only one approach for interpretation of the raw data. Equally valid results may be obtained by fitting the observed kinetic behavior to simulated rate laws.  \n### Exploring catalyst activation and deactivation  \n<ImageHere>a) According to the proposed mechanism for the palladium-catalyzed amination of aryl halides, an induction period will be present as the active catalyst is generated from an inactive pre-catalyst (where L = BINAP). b) This induction period may be observed at early conversion points, before the catalyzed reaction reaches its maximum rate. In same-excess experiments, this will manifest itself in the non-overlying portions of curves designed to intercept the original reaction at intermediate conversion points. Here, a same-excess (e\u00a0=\u00a00.60\u00a0M) of ArX relative to HNR2 and MOR is utilized for each of the curves.\nAs described above, same-excess experiments are conducted with two or more experiments holding the excess, (e) constant while changing the absolute concentrations of the substrates (in this case, the catalyst is also treated as a substrate.) Note that this construction causes the number of equivalents and therefore the mole percentage of each reagent/catalyst to differ between reactions. These experiments enable one to artificially \"enter\" the reaction at any point, as the initial concentrations of one experiment (the intercepting reaction) are chosen to map directly onto the anticipated concentrations at some intermediate time, t, in another (the parent reaction). One would expect the reaction progress, described by the rate vs. substrate concentration plots detailed above, to map directly onto each other from that interception point onward. This will hold true, however, only if the rate of the reaction is not altered by changes to the active substrate/catalyst concentration (such as by catalyst activation, catalyst deactivation, or product inhibition) before that interception.  \nA perfect overlay of multiple experiments with the same-excess but different initial substrate loadings suggests that no changes in the active substrate/catalyst concentration occur over the course of the reaction. The failure of the plots to overlay is generally indicative of catalyst activation, deactivation, or product inhibition under the reaction conditions. These cases may be distinguished by the position of the reaction progress curves relative to each other. Intercepting reactions lying below (slower rates at the same substrate concentration) the parent reactions on the rate vs. substrate concentration plot, are indicative of catalyst activation under reaction conditions. Intercepting reactions lying above (faster rates at the same substrate concentration) the parent reactions on the rate vs. substrate concentration plot, are indicative of catalyst deactivation under reaction conditions; further experimentation is necessary to distinguish product inhibition from other forms of catalyst death.  \nOne key difference between the intercepting reaction and the parent reaction described above is the presence of some amount of product in the parent reaction at the interception point. Product inhibition has long been known to influence catalyst efficiency of many systems, and in the case of same-excess experiments, it prevents the intercepting and parent reactions from overlaying. While same-excess experiments as described above cannot attribute catalyst deactivation to any particular cause, product inhibition can be probed by further experiments in which some initial amount of product is added to the intercepting reaction (designed to mimic the amount of product expected to be present in the parent reaction at the same substrate concentration). A perfect overlay of the rate vs. substrate concentration plots under same-excess-same product conditions indicates that product inhibition does occur under the reaction conditions used. While the failure of the rate vs. substrate concentration plots to overlay under same-excess-same product conditions does not preclude product inhibition, it does, at least, indicate that other catalyst deactivation paths must also be active.  \nReaction progress kinetic analysis can distinguish a) uninhibited catalysis b) irreversible catalyst death, and c) product inhibition by a series of same-excess experiments. Lack of overlay between rate vs. substrate concentration for multiple trials of the same reaction with the same-excess but different initial concentrations is indicative of product inhibition or catalyst death. The two may be distinguished where overlay of same-excess experiments with added product is indicative of product inhibition, where lack of overlay is indicative of an alternative form of catalyst death.  \nSame-excess experiments probing catalyst deactivation and product inhibition are among the most widely used applications of reaction progress kinetic analysis. Among the numerous examples in the literature, some include investigation of the amino alcohol-catalyzed zinc alkylation of aldehydes, the amido-thiourea catalyzed asymmetric Strecker synthesis of unnatural amino acids, and the SOMO-activation of organocatalysts.\n\n## Determining reaction stoichiometry  \n### Differential methods for extracting rate constants  \nWith the wealth of data available from monitoring reaction progress over time paired with the power of modern computing methods, it has become reasonably straightforward to numerically evaluate the rate law, mapping the integrated rate laws of simulated reactions paths onto a fit of reaction progress over time. Due to the principles of the propagation of error, rate constants and rate laws can be determined by these differential methods with significantly lower uncertainty than by the construction of graphical rate equations (above.)  \n### Different-excess experiments  \nWhile RPKA allows observation of rates over the course of the entire reaction, conducting only same-excess experiments does not provide sufficient information for determination of the corresponding rate constants. In order to construct enough independent relationships to solve for all of the unknown rate constants, it is necessary to examine systems with different-excess.  \n<ImageHere>Consider the simple example where the catalyst associates with substrate A, followed by reaction with B to form product, P and free catalyst. Regardless of the approximation applied, multiple independent parameters (k1, k\u22121, and k2 in the case of steady-state; k2 and K1 in the case of pre-equilibrium) are required to define the system. While one could imagine constructing multiple equations to describe the unknowns at different concentrations, when the data is obtained from a same-excess experiment A and B are not independent. Multiple experiments using different values of e are necessary to establish multiple independent equations defining the multiple independent rate constants in terms of experimental rates and concentrations. Non-linear least squares analysis may then be employed to obtain best fit values of the unknown rate constants to those equations.\nConsider again the simple example discussed above where the catalyst associates with substrate A, followed by reaction with B to form product P and free catalyst. Regardless of the approximation applied, multiple independent parameters (k2 and K1 in the case of pre-equilibrium; k1, k\u22121, and k2 in the case of steady-state) are required to define the system. While one could imagine constructing multiple equations to describe the unknowns at different concentrations, when the data is obtained from a same-excess experiment A and B are not independent:  \ne = B \u2212 A  \nMultiple experiments using different values of e are necessary to establish multiple independent equations defining the multiple independent rate constants in terms of experimental rates and concentrations. Non-linear least squares analysis may then be employed to obtain best fit values of the unknown rate constants to those equations.\n\n### Graphical rate laws  \nOne possible sequence for establishing kinetic order by reaction progress kinetic analysis. Adapted with modification from the process proposed by Donna Blackmond  \nKineticists have historically relied on linearization of rate data to extrapolate rate constants, perhaps best demonstrated by the widespread use of the standard Lineweaver\u2013Burk linearization of the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation. Linearization techniques were of particular importance before the advent of computing techniques capable of fitting complex curves, and they remain a staple in kinetics due to their intuitively simple presentation. It is important to note that linearization techniques should NOT be used to extract numerical rate constants as they introduce a large degree of error relative to alternative numerical techniques. Graphical rate laws do, however, maintain that intuitive presentation of linearized data, such that visual inspection of the plot can provide mechanistic insight regarding the reaction at hand. The basis for a graphical rate law rests on the rate (v) vs. substrate concentration (S) plots discussed above. For example, in the simple cycle discussed with regard to different-excess experiments a plot of sfrac|v|A vs. B and its twin sfrac|v|B vs. A can provide intuitive insight about the order of each of the reagents. If plots of sfrac|v|A vs. B overlay for multiple experiments with different-excess, the data are consistent with a first-order dependence on A. The same could be said for a plot of sfrac|v|B vs. A; overlay is consistent with a first-order dependence on B. Non-overlaying results of these graphical rate laws are possible and are indicative of higher order dependence on the substrates probed. Blackmond has proposed presenting the results of different-excess experiments with a series of graphical rate equations (that she presents in a flow-chart adapted here), but it is important to note that her proposed method is only one of many possible methods to display the kinetic relationship. Furthermore, while the presentation of graphical rate laws may at times be considered a visually simplified way to present complex kinetic data, fitting the raw kinetic data for analysis by differential or other rigorous numerical methods is necessary to extract accurate and quantitative rate constants and reaction orders.  \n### Reaction stoichiometry and mechanism  \nIt is important to note that even while kinetic analysis is a powerful tool for determining the stoichiometry of the turn-over limiting transition state relative to the ground state, it cannot answer all mechanistic questions. It is possible for two mechanisms to be kinetically indistinguishable, especially under catalytic conditions. For any thorough mechanistic evaluation it is necessary to conduct kinetic analysis of both the catalytic process and its individual steps (when possible) in concert with other forms of analysis such as evaluation of linear free energy relationships, isotope effect studies, computational analysis, or any number of alternative approaches. Finally, it is important to note that no mechanistic hypothesis can ever be proven; alternative mechanistic hypothesis can only be disproven. It is, therefore, essential to conduct any investigation in a hypothesis-driven manner. Only by experimentally disproving reasonable alternatives can the support for a given hypothesis be strengthened.\n\nQuestion: Which image describes an experimental setup that allows for the distinction between product inhibition and other forms of catalyst deactivation?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Investigate the given text and attached images, make inferences from the combined evidence, and answer the asked questions.\nNasser addressing the United Nations General Assembly, 1960\nEgypt's nationalisation of the British-owned Suez Canal was a great victory for Nasser who was celebrated as both an Egyptian hero and an Arab one, capable of 'defeating the nation's enemies' and 'representing Arab dignity'.\"  Chinese premier Zhou Enlai called Nasser 'the giant of the Middle East.'  \nNasser emerged as one of the architects of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was founded in 1961 as a bloc of 'independent nations' detached from both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Almost all African anti-colonialist freedom fighters came to him for guidance, moral support and funds.\n\n### Opposition to Baghdad Pact  \nA major reason why conservative Arab regimes felt threatened by Nasser during his first years in power was that his popularity had been demonstrated \u2013 even before the Suez crisis \u2013 when he became a leading critic of the 1955 Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact was initially an alliance between Iraq and Turkey, which Britain supported with the goal of strengthening its power within the Middle East. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact to be part of a British effort to split the Arab countries into differing groups, and to divide the region by escalating tension between them. The British later attempted to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact in late 1955 after Nasser agreed to purchase arms from Czechoslovakia in the Soviet bloc. The British were determined to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and to apply pressure to try to force Jordan to join. Nasser had opposed the Baghdad Pact, and his successful effort to prevent Jordan from joining the pact is an example of his pragmatic diplomatic strategy. Nasser's pragmatism towards Jordan meant that he aimed to force the Jordan regime to decline to join the pact, but he did not himself attempt to overthrow the regime. This stance was rewarded with Jordanian support for Egypt during the Suez Crisis the following year in 1956.  \nThe dispute over Jordanian membership in the Baghdad Pact lasted from November to December 1955. Nasser's goal was based on Egyptian national interests \u2013 he wanted to prevent Jordanian membership in the Baghdad Pact, which was more important to him than the fate of the Jordanian regime. He was thus prepared to offer the Jordanian regime a way out in which it could survive if it did not join the pact. Nasser's strategy during the debate over the Baghdad Pact was to apply rhetorical pressure using Egyptian propaganda to launch broadcasts attacking the British, and also warning the Jordanian regime that it could be overthrown if it agreed to join the pact.  The Egyptian propaganda led to riots occurring in Jordan in December 1955 during a visit of British Field Marshal Templer, who was serving as the British Defense Chief of Staff.  \nThe nature of the message that Egyptian propaganda conveyed during the crisis over Jordanian accession to the Baghdad pact is very significant. Its primary focus was on attacking the British rather than the Jordanian regime itself, and it did not itself call for the overthrow of King Hussein. In other words, this propaganda was intended to pressure the regime, and likely to implicitly convince King Hussein that his prospects for remaining in power would be greater if he declined to join the Baghdad Pact, and Jordan decided in December that it would not join the agreement. King Hussein remained in power, and sided with Egypt in future crises such as in the 1956 Suez Crisis or in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Egypt thus derived a direct reward from their pragmatic approach towards King Hussein's regime, and the example of the dispute over the Baghdad Pact may have convinced King Hussein that he needed to align with Egypt in future crisis situations. The power of Arab Nationalism also led King Hussein to dismiss the British General John Bagot Glubb as commander of the Arab Legion in 1956. The dismissal of Glubb took place while the British Foreign Secretary was in Egypt, and the British believed that represented a direct challenge by Nasser to their authority in the region.  \n### The Tripartite Aggression  \n<ImageHere>Nasser returns to cheering crowds in Cairo after announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company\n\n\n#### Background  \nEgypt had been seeking loans from the World Bank since late 1955 to finance the construction of the Aswan High Dam. A tentative agreement with the World Bank, the US and Britain indicated that US$70 million would be provided for the project. However, Nasser had recently (September 27, 1955) negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union which provided technical and military aid to the regime, thereby angering the United States which had up until the point been supportive of Nasser and his anti-British and anti-French colonialism.  Consequently, after pressure from the British government concerning the threat posed by Nasser, on 20 July 1956, the US and Britain withdrew their offers of funding, and the World Bank went back on the agreement. On 26 July, Nasser gave a historic speech announcing the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, under his \"Egyptianization\" policy, and whose revenues would be used to finance the construction of the High Dam, which was completed in January 1968.  The nationalisation escalated tension with Britain and France, which froze Egyptian assets and put their armies on alert.  \nOn 1 August, the USSR offered to fund the High Dam project. Relations with Britain and France which had deteriorated to a frosty cold war level by the summer, were framed anew when the United States withdrew much of its support in demonstration against Nasser's growing friendship with the Soviet Union.  Having at last convinced the United States of its error in supporting the Free Officers Movement and the special threat posed by Nasser, the British and French felt free to intrigue for his overthrow. These moves culminated in the Tripartite Anglo-French-Israeli aggression on Egypt in October.  \n#### Plan  \nIn a final replay of old European power politics, the British and French negotiated a plan with Israel which would result in the return of the Suez to the British and French, the overthrow of the Nasser regime, and restoration of European, Christian and Jewish property.  Although the later had suffered under the new regime, unlike the Europeans, most Jewish property survived the Egyptianization.  Consequently, Israel, which had previously been used as an interlocuteur for both Soviet and American support for the RCC still had substantial elements operating in Egypt.  Now the British and French decided to use this to their advantage once Israel saw the large threat Nasser posed to their continued existence.  Under their plan, Israeli elements in Egypt with launch false flag operations which would be used as a pretext for Israeli launching a surprise attack on Egypt across the Sinai and toward the Suez.  Using the terms of the Canal treaty which allowed the British and French to use military force in protection of the canal, an Anglo-French force would invade the canal area and subsequently invade Cairo.  \n#### Invasion  \nIsraeli troops invaded Gaza and advanced toward the Sinai on 29 October.  Accordingly, under the terms of the Canal Treaty, the British and French troops attacked the Canal Zone on 31 October using a combined force of air strikes, naval bombardment, and parachute drops.  Large amphibious and infantry units were steaming from Cyprus and Algeria toward the canal for the final occupation and push into Cairo. Whilst the operation had all the elements necessary for surprise and legerdemain, it lacked quickness of speed given the relative strategic weakness which the British and French found themselves in the post-war period.  \nFor although the British and French still had substantial force projection capabilities and were the overwhelming military power in the region, both countries were heavily dependent on American support for their economies through the purchase of British and French debt, American direct investment, and most importantly, through the support American oil companies provided for European consumption.  Consequently, by the time when the Anglo-French armada began its reinforcement of British and French positions on the Canal, the American government had already come under massive pressure from the United Nations, the Soviet Union, and most importantly from American oil companies which saw the British and French as impediments to their commercial expansion in the Middle East.  \nWhen the American anger at the British and French intervention was felt at Whitehall, the British government fractured between those who saw the futility of maintaining the British Empire, those who saw the potential threat the Americans posed to the overall British economy should they end financial support of the British economy, and those British interests which still saw a need, a necessity and a reason for maintaining the British Empire. Thus, when the Eisenhower Administration initiated an oil embargo on the British and French, there was immediate panic in the British government.  The French however were proving more resolute and flouted American demands stating matter of factly that America had no interest in the Middle East and were duplicitous in their support of Arab nationalism and anti-colonialism.  \nHowever, with the embargo, the British pound which as a reserve currency was used in the purchase of oil had its liquidity threatened.  While the British government debated this turn of events, the military campaign dithered and proved lacklustre in its execution, thereby buying crucial time for the Nasser regime to rally support from American liberals, the Soviet Union, and others in the United Nations.  Finally, when in a bid of solidarity with the Nasser regime, the US government said it would no longer price support the British pound through the purchasing of British debt, the appeasers within the British government gained the upper hand and forced a surrender to American demands. Consequently, British operations were halted on 7 November.  When negotiations between the British and Americans made clear that the US was in opposition to the continuation of the British and French Empires, the British government's position on its control of the Suez Canal collapsed.  Henceforth it was not military operations but the liquidation of what remained of British and French assets and prestige which allowed the Anglo-French armies to remain until finally, on 22 December they were removed.  As a result, all British and French banks and companies, 15,000 establishments in all, were nationalized, a process that was later extended to all foreign establishments and also to Egyptian firms. But more importantly, the event marked the abandonment of by the United States to an overt Western Civilizational identity especially of supremacy, as well as America's opposition to a European global commercial presence which it viewed as a competitor to its own global vision.  As a result, with the primary leader of the West opposed to the very raison d'\u00eatre of European colonialism, the Suez Crisis, initiated by the Free Officers Movement and the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 marked the end of European Civilization Supremacy.  \nAccording to the prominent historian Abd aI-\u2019Azim Ramadan, Nasser decision to nationalize the Suez Canal was his alone, made without political or military consultation. The events leading up to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, as other events during Nasser's rule, showed Nasser's inclination to solitary decision making. He considers Nasser to be far from a rational, responsible leader.  \n### Union with Syria  \nright  \nOn 22 February 1958, Egypt united with Syria, creating the United Arab Republic (UAR). The 1956 Constitution was abrogated following the union and a provisional one decreed. The Egyptian National Assembly was dissolved. On 2 April, Nasser issued a decree establishing the flag of the Republic as three horizontal bars of red, white and black with two stars. There was a crackdown on communists on 31 December for their allegedly lukewarm response to the Union with Syria.  \nFollowing Syrian secession in 1962, a Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of Popular Forces was convened in Cairo to prepare for a National Congress to lay down a Charter for National Action. The 1,750-member Congress of representatives from peasant, laborer, professional and occupational associations meets in May to debate the Draft National Charter presented by Nasser. On 30 June, the Congress approves the Charter, which sets up a new political organization, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) to replace the National Union.  50 per cent of the seats in the ASU are to be filled by farmers and workers.  Elected ASU units are set up in factories, firms, agricultural cooperatives, ministries and professional syndicates.  \n### Yemen War  \nIn 1962, Egypt became involved in the civil war in Yemen, supporting the revolutionary regime of Abdullah al-Sallal that had ousted the country's former ruler, Imam Badr, and declared a republic. This proved to be a considerable financial and military burden on Egypt and created antipathy toward Saudi Arabia, which supported the Yemeni loyalists.  \nNasser in 1962  \n### 1967 War  \nFrom 14 May 1967 Nasser poured his divisions into Sinai Peninsula, near the Israeli border. Under Arab pressure and as a result of rising popular expectations of Arab military might, on 18 May 1967, Nasser asks UN Secretary General U Thant to withdraw the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) stationed on Egypt's side of the border with Israel in Sinai. Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping although Israel repeatedly declared that closure of the Straits of Tiran would be an act of war. King Hussein of Jordan visited Cairo on 30 May, signing a Jordanian-Egyptian defense pact.  \nEgypt planned to attack Israel on 27 May but canceled it in the last minute.  \nOn 5 June, Israeli army forces dealt a crushing blow to Egypt. Seventeen Egyptian airfields were attacked, and most of the Egyptian air force destroyed on the ground leading to the Israeli occupation of the Sinai Peninsula and the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip. Jordan and Syria entered the war on Egypt's side, and Israel reacted and occupied the Jordanian territories of the West Bank and the Syrian Golan Heights. Egypt, Jordan and Syria accepted a UN Security Council ceasefire on 7 June to 10 June.  \nEgypt's defeat in the 1967 War compelled Nasser to resign on 9 June, naming Vice-President Zakaria Mohieddin as his successor. However, he relented following massive popular demonstrations of support. Seven high-ranking officers were tried in the wake of the defeat, including Minister of War Shams Badran. Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces Field-Marshal Abdel-Hakim Amer was arrested and is reported to have committed suicide while in custody in August.  \n## Society  \nPresident Nasser during a televised speech, 1968  \nAt the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor.  Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, and most of them being boys. Nearly 75% of the population over ten years of age, and over 90% of all females were illiterate. Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform, the major assets' confiscation programme, the dramatic growth in university education, the creation of a dominating public sector flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965\u201366, overall public school enrollments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.\n\nQuestion: Which event is depicted in Image 2?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Analyze the given context and associated images, draw inferences from the combination of both, and provide responses to posed questions.\n<ImageHere>Matt Kenseth (pictured in 2009) led after passing Ambrose early in the race and eventually finished third after leading 17 laps.\nThe race commenced at 3:05\u00a0p.m. local time. Ambrose broke free from the pack to lead on the approach to the first turn. The first caution came on the following lap when Kurt Busch spun on the backstretch. Ambrose maintained the lead at the lap five restart and held off a challenge from Biffle. On lap six, Biffle tried again, and was successful next time round, getting ahead of Ambrose to take over the lead. Josh Wise's engine failed on lap ten, necessitating the second caution as oil was laid on the track. During the caution, Earnhardt and Biffle made pit stops. The race restarted six laps later, with Biffle keeping his lead over Ambrose. After starting ninth, Logano had moved into the third position by the 21st lap. On the next lap, Kenseth passed Logano to move into third place. A competition caution was waved on lap 26 to mandate that teams made pit stops because of the new left-hand side tires, and the track's newer pavement. Ambrose led the field at the restart on the 31st lap. Kenseth overtook Ambrose to claim the lead on the next lap.  \nAfter starting 34th, Kyle Busch was running in seventh by lap 34. As Kenseth increased his lead over Ambrose, Martin overtook Logano for third place on the 39th lap. Four laps later, Logano lost the fourth position to Biffle. That same lap, Keselowski got ahead of Almirola for tenth. Upfront, Ambrose closed the gap to Kenseth, and he overtook him for the lead on lap 49 despite the presence of Ken Schrader's slower car. A second competition caution for drivers to make mandatory pit stops came out on lap 51. The caution was withdrawn five laps later, and Biffle led the field at the restart, followed by Ambrose and Martin. On lap 60, Ambrose attempted to challenge Biffle for the first position but he could not pass him. Keselowski moved into fifth four laps later. On the 69th lap, Ambrose passed Biffle for the lead, and Earnhardt got ahead of Biffle soon after. On the next lap, Earnhardt overtook Ambrose to become the new leader. While Earnhardt increased his advantage at the front of the pack, Martin got by Biffle to advance into third by the 79th lap.  \nIn the meantime, drivers elected to make green flag pit stops between the 78th to 81st laps. On lap 82, the fifth caution was prompted when foam from a SAFER barrier beside the circuit had to be cleared by series officials. Drivers continued to make pit stops under caution conditions. At the lap 87 restart, Earnhardt was passed by Stewart on the entry to the first turn for the first position. Newman and Logano got ahead of Ambrose to move into sixth and seventh places on lap 90. Ambrose lost a further four positions to Martin, Keselowski, Menard, and Montoya during lap 91. By the following lap, Gordon was in fourth place. Later, Stewart increased his lead over Earnhardt to seven-tenths of a second by lap 97. However, eight laps later, Earnhardt closed the gap to Stewart and passed him to get back the lead. Green flag pit stops were made from laps 115 and 120, before a sixth caution came out for Kurt Busch who spun for a second time in the second turn on the 121st lap. Gordon led at the lap 126 restart, but his teammate Earnhardt passed him around the outside in turn two soon after.\n<ImageHere>Dale Earnhardt Jr. (pictured in 2015) led a race-high 95 to end a 143-race winless streak and claim the 19th victory of his career.\nOn the lap, a seventh caution was prompted for a three-car accident, that began when Logano attempted to avoid hitting Gilliland (who made contact with the barrier), and lost control of his car. Logano turned back into the wall, collecting Gilliland and Kahne. Logano was transported out of the track via an ambulance as a precaution. The race restarted on the 133rd lap, with Earnhardt holding the lead over Gordon and Montoya through the first and second turns. Soon after, the eighth caution was waved; Hamlin and Newman made contact, sending Hamlin spinning on the exit to turn four, and into the grass. As Hamlin went down pit road with oil trailing from his car, its right-hand side caught fire, and he stopped in his pit box. Hamlin received assistance to exit his car by Newman's and Kyle Busch's pit crews, as safety officials extinguished the fire. Hamlin was unhurt. Earnhardt continued to maintain the lead through turn one at the lap 141 restart. Behind Earnhardt, Stewart kept second place from Gordon. Five laps later, Biffle passed Bowyer for fourth, and Ambrose was overtaken by Martin for tenth.  \nJohnson got past Montoya on the 147th lap. Twelve laps later, Bowyer was passed by Kenseth. Biffle overtook Gordon to move into third on lap 160. The final round of green flag pit stops began on lap 163, as Earnhardt made his stop. Biffle, Bowyer, McMurray, and Keselowski each led the pack over the next seven laps, until Earnhardt regained the lead after all pit stops had been completed. On lap 186, Biffle lost third place to Johnson. Six laps later, Johnson lost third to Kenseth, and fell to fifth as Biffle got ahead of him. In the meantime, Earnhardt opened his lead at the front of the field to more than five seconds, and he held it for the remainder of the race to win. It was his first victory in 143 races, his second at Michigan International Speedway, and the 19th of his career. Stewart finished second, Kenseth was third, Biffle took fourth, and Johnson fifth. Gordon, Bowyer, Montoya, Ambrose, and Harvick rounded out the top ten finishers. There were 23 lead changes among 14 different drivers during the race. Earnhardt's 95 laps led was the most of any competitor.\n\n### Post-race  \nEarnhardt appeared in Victory Lane to celebrate his first win since the 2008 LifeLock 400 in front of the crowd of 82,000 people; the win earned him $168,775. He dedicated the victory to his fanbase and thanked his team and pit crew for supporting him, \"I was so nervous in the last few laps of that race four years ago. Today, this is the worst feeling, riding around there with 15 laps to go wondering what's going to happen or how you were going to lose. I was just thinking, man, those laps could not go by fast enough. It feels good to win, But in a day or two, I'll be thirsty for the next one.\" Stewart conceded that Earnhardt had a faster car than his but insisted that the latter's victory was not designated as \"a national holiday\" due to its popularity, \"This morning they were celebrating his fourth anniversary of his last win, so I guess we're all in a state of mourning now, because he's broke that string now, so I don't know what we're all supposed to think.\" Third-placed Kenseth said of his race, \"It was kind of a long day. We were pretty good in the beginning of the race and got shuffled back and it was tough to work traffic today. They got the setup good on the last two runs and had good pit stops and we were able to stand on the gas and work our way up there to third.\"  \nEarnhardt received congratulations via text messages from various people and celebrities through Twitter, including former driver Mario Andretti, multi-instrumentalist Charlie Daniels and country music singer Brad Paisley. He also received a phone call from South Carolina Gamecocks football coach Steve Spurrier. Steve Letarte, Earnhardt's crew chief, commented his belief that the driver and team's focus helped him to win, \"I can't say enough about the group of guys we have here. They are a tremendous group. They deserve a tremendous amount of the credit. Dale deserves a tremendous amount of credit as well. He's not only a great driver, but he's a leader in the team. He does it in his own style and we love the style he brings. It was a fun day to finally get him to Victory Lane.\" Tori Petry of sports radio station WGGG opined the victory helped NASCAR receive better exposure, and Los Angeles Times writer Jim Peltz wrote he believed it would provide the series with an attendance and television ratings increase. Jeff Hammond of Speed said the victory was the result of Earnhardt's team having improved momentum and better focus. He wrote of his expectation for Earnhardt to perform well for the remainder of the season.  \nHamlin's car bay fire on lap 133 was the first of his career. He said it was an experience that he hoped to avoid in the future but praised the modern safety standards of racing vehicles, \"Thankfully, we've got everything that we have safety-wise. One good thing at least is that Ryan's guys came and got me out \u2013 and a couple of the 18 (Busch's) guys. NASCAR is a family, and any time anyone is in trouble, everyone is going to try to help. It's good that those guys were around and willing to take a chance.\" Logano commented that he believed he could have corrected his car in his three-car crash with Gilliland and Kahne, \"It's a little frustrating, but we had a top-10 car today, I think we had a top 10 coming to us here \u2013 maybe a top five.\" Ambrose, who led early in the event and then lost positions, said he would accept a top ten finish and was proud of his team, \"We led some laps and looked good up there. It was a strong day for us. Not quite what we wanted, but we will take it and move along to Sonoma.\"  \nThe result kept Kenseth in the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 523 points, ahead of Earnhardt who lowered his advantage from ten to four points. Biffle maintained third place with 548 points. With 532 points, Johnson moved ahead of Hamlin (514 points) to assume the fourth position. Harvick, Truex, Stewart, Bowyer, Keselowski, Edwards and Kyle Busch rounded out the top twelve. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 105 points. Toyota remained in second place with 87 points, ten points ahead of Ford, who in turn, were sixteen points in front of Dodge in fourth. The race had a television audience of 5,284,000 million viewers and a 3.2 US rating, a 10 percent ratings increase and 8 percent more viewership than the 2011 race; it took two hours, 52 minutes, and 29 seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 5.393 seconds.  \n### Race results  \n## Standings after the race  \nDrivers' Championship standings  \nManufacturers' Championship standings  \n* Note: Only the top twelve positions are included for the driver standings.\n\nQuestion: Which driver led the most laps during the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway and ultimately won the race?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Study the presented context and accompanying images, form conclusions based on the combined data, and answer the questions raised.\n<ImageHere>A trolley bus in front of Columbus City Hall, c. 1936-55\nSimilarly, in 1933, a decision was made to gradually convert the entire streetcar system to trolley buses (trackless trams). Slowed by the effects of the Great Depression and World War II, the process took 15 years to compete. The Columbus Railway, Power & Light Company was renamed to the Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company in 1937. On September 5, 1948, the last two fixed rail trams ran along Neil Avenue and Main Street. The electric company handed over its transit operations to the Columbus Transit Company in November 1949. A lack of investment in maintenance of the tracks, as well as the age of the automobile had slowly brought the demise of the system. The buses were larger, more comfortable and powerful, and soon had air conditioning. The trolley buses did not last long either, being gradually replaced by diesel buses as well. The last trolley bus ran on May 30, 1965. That last ride traversed the Main, Oak, and High Street lines, a 5.5-hour ride that culminated in a ceremony for pulling down a trolley pole and de-energizing the streetcar lines.  \nBus investment continued throughout the 1960s and 1970s, though ridership had been irreversibly declining since 1948, with a monumentous drop from then through 1972  from 80.1 million passengers to 15.2 million. In 1973, the Columbus Transit Company went out of business. The company was subsequently replaced by the government agency the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), which still operates today.  \nDespite some changes over the years, many current COTA buses run the same routes as the former streetcars. Bus lines 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 13 deviate very little from the routes taken by their railed predecessors.  \nAround 2017, the company Hopper Carts began serving downtown and the Short North with a free ridesharing service paid for by businesses and with ads on the sides of the vehicles. The company utilized several six-passenger Polaris GEM e6 vehicles, described as \"retro-futuristic golf carts\". Another program, car2go, operated in Columbus, mostly at Ohio State University and downtown, until 2018. The business operated Smart Cars available to rent by the minute.  \nSmart Columbus, a transportation initiative of the City of Columbus and the Columbus Partnership, operated two driverless shuttle pilots, in downtown Columbus and Linden, around 2018.\n\n## Current services  \n### COTA  \nColumbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA). The service operates 41 routes with a fleet of 440 buses, serving approximately 19 million passengers per year. COTA operates 23 regular fixed-service routes, 14 express services, a bus rapid transit route, a free downtown circulator, night service, an airport connector, and other services.  \nCOTA's administrative offices are located in the William J. Lhota Building in Downtown Columbus. It is managed by President and CEO Joanna Pinkerton along with a 13-member board of trustees. COTA is funded by a permanent 0.25% sales tax as well as another 10-year 0.25% sales tax. The agency was founded in 1971, replacing the private Columbus Transit Company. The Central Ohio Transit Authority began operating in 1974, and has made gradual improvements to its fleet and network. Its first bus network redesign took place in 2017. The 2010s have also seen noted service improvements, with the addition of the CBUS free downtown circulator in 2014, its AirConnect airport service in 2016, and the CMAX bus rapid transit service in 2018.  \n### Intercity buses  \nIntercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines, Barons Bus Lines, Miller Transportation, GoBus, and other carriers.  \nIntercity bus transit dates back to 1929 in Columbus. Numerous stations have been constructed in Downtown Columbus; the Columbus Bus Station was completed in 1969.  \n### Alternative transportation  \nIn partnership with UZURV, COTA provides on demand transportation for the elderly and disabled.  \nAlong with most other US cities, Columbus has several private transportation options, including ridesharing, bikeshare, and electric scooters. The city's bikeshare system is CoGo, operated by Lyft. Electric scooter companies operating in the city include Bird, Spin, and Lime.  \nOhio State University students, faculty, and employees are served by the Campus Area Bus Service, an Ohio State-run bus service around the Columbus campus.  \n## Proposals  \n### Former proposals  \n#### TransCenter  \nTransCenter was a proposed replacement for Union Station. The demolition and replacement of Union Station dates to a 1969\u20131975 lawsuit against the Columbus-based Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI). The institute was formed as a nonprofit and still operates as one, though its improper profit uses led to the lawsuit. As a result, BMI offered about $80 million for various causes, including $36.5 million to establish a convention center at the site of Union Station. BMI established  the Battelle Commons Corporation in 1974 to handle the project.  \nBattelle Commons Corporation applied for grants to create a transit center as part of the convention center, including from the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) and Federal Highway Administration. The transit center project was supported by the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), Columbus's mass transit agency. The proposed hub, titled TransCenter, was to include 2,000 square feet inside the restored Union Station arcade, containing transit information, ticket offices, a bus waiting and loading area, and entranceways to transit below street-level. A new 20,000-square-foot bus facility and COTA office was to be constructed alongside the arcade. The proposed funding included $6.24 million from the UMTA for buildings and platforms, $1.05 million from the Federal Railroad Administration for restoring the arcade, and Battelle contributing $1.56 million for the building and platforms, and $450,000 for the arcade. The combined project was to cost $9.3 million. It was noted that Battelle made no effort to find funding from obvious sources including the State Historic Preservation Office, the National Endowment for the Arts, Department of the Interior, Community Development Block Grants, or General Revenue Sharing Funds.  \nOn October 19, 1976, Battelle's trustees decided to demolish the station, stating it would be an \"imprudent use of Battelle's money\", even though it was noted to be a small portion. The organization gave no warning to outside organizations. The State Historic Preservation was not advised, nor was COTA; COTA's executive director stated the public mistakenly blamed it for the demolition. The City of Columbus also stated it was not involved in the decision, but knew Battelle was considering it. Battelle believed the demolition would not block the pending federal funding.  \nAt 6 pm on Friday, October 22, 1976, S.G. Loewendick & Sons demolished nearly the entire arcade. By 6 pm on the next day, a temporary restraining order secured by the Ohio Historical Society halted the demolition. The order noted that improper procedures were followed in planning its demolition. Battelle then allowed the historical society 120 days to remove the remaining remnant of the demolition, a single arch left standing; Battelle offered no funds to help preserve or move the arch. COTA's director still expressed his desire for TransCenter to be built, despite the arcade's loss. Battelle published development plans with the arcade removed as soon as October 24. The arcade's demolition prompted the UMTA to withdraw all $6.24 million in funding, stating the act violated the spirit of the law and was inconsistent with UMTA requirements.  \n#### Ameriflora '92 Monorail  \nAs part of the planning for the 1992 Ameriflora exhibition, Columbus city leaders considered a $50 million proposal to build monorails connecting the Port Columbus International Airport to the Greater Columbus Convention Center. The July 13, 1987, \"very loose\" proposal from Von Roll Habegger would have connected the Ohio Center with a loop along 3rd and High streets to the county offices at Mound Street, with a potential extension south to German Village and the Brewery District. A second proposed loop would cross the Scioto River to connect to the Ohio Penitentiary, Veterans Memorial, and Central High School. The estimated cost was $40\u201350 million, if a contract could be signed by 1988. The monorail would use rubber-tired beamrider cars carrying 4,000 to 8,000 passengers per hour at speeds up to 30\u00a0mph.  \nA committee formed to study the proposal, led by Upper Arlington Mayor Priscilla Mead, rejected it in November 1987. The committee recommended an automated peoplemover solution like those used in Detroit and Miami, with a daily ridership of 6,000 to 8,000 people, at a cost of $60\u201380 million.  \n#### Ohio Hub  \nThe Ohio Hub project, created in 2009, proposed a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and to a proposed hub in Cleveland and onward to the east. As of 2018, the project remained unfunded.  \n#### Columbus Streetcar  \nThe Columbus Streetcar was a proposed streetcar system to be located in and close to Downtown Columbus. Initially planned to run along High Street, the line would have run for km and connected the Ohio State campus with the Franklin County Government Center. As of February 2009, the plan was indefinitely on hold.  \n#### Rail proposals  \nVarious proposals have been discussed for light rail in Columbus. The first formal discussions took place in the 1980s. In 1999, voters rejected a levy request which would have funded it. In 2002, COTA began studying a 13-mile line from downtown to the north side. With an inability to win federal funding, the effort ceased in 2006.  \nCOTA's long-range transit plan released in 1999 proposed eight commuter rail routes along existing freight rail tracks. The plan called for these services to be phased in from 2005 to 2020. COTA would begin operating a rail line north along I-71 in 2005, a northwest track along Ohio Route 315 in 2008, a track along Cleveland Avenue in 2011, along East Broad Street in 2014, another northwest track and southeast track in 2017, and a south track along Route 3 and West Broad track in 2020. Alongside the commuter rail improvements, the plan called for bus service to double, including 24-hour service, as well as a downtown rail service and multi-modal transit hub as well as multiple circulator bus loops. COTA placed two sales tax proposals on the November 1999 ballot to fund current service and these improvements, Issue 21 continuing a .25 percent sales tax for 10 more years, as well as Issue 20, a new permanent .25 percent sales tax. Issue 21 failed to pass, restricting COTA's ability to build rail lines.  \n### Current proposals  \nNumerous proposals are being developed to link Columbus with other Midwest cities, and to link neighborhoods within Columbus. Transit modes being developed include intercity rail, the hyperloop, and light rail or bus rapid transit. LinkUS is an initiative announced in 2020 to create high-capacity rapid transit in Central Ohio. The initiative is a collaboration between COTA, the City of Columbus, and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission. The initiative will also aim to create jobs as well as transit-oriented developments. It will begin its focus on Columbus's northwest corridor, and then to an east-west corridor consisting of Broad and Main Streets. City officials aim for projects like Indianapolis's Red Line (a bus rapid transit line). Federal funding was announced for the two corridors in November 2020, to be released in 2023 and 2024.  \nIn 2021, Amtrak announced plans to connect Columbus to Cleveland and Cincinnati via intercity rail as a part of the American Jobs Plan. Details released in May 2021 describe a thrice-daily service between Cleveland and Cincinnati, stopping at Cleveland's airport, Crestline, Delaware, Columbus, Springfield, Dayton, and Sharonville before terminating in Cincinnati. The service is proposed to be completed by 2035. In anticipation of the plan, the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority released a plan for a Columbus Amtrak station in January 2022. The plan details a $23 million station adjacent to the Greater Columbus Convention Center, to be built if Amtrak's plans are approved. The two-story station would have a single side platform. Other proposals submitted to Amtrak by 2022 include services to Athens, Chillicothe, Toledo, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  \nThe Pittsburgh-Columbus-Chicago corridor is one of ten selected by Virgin Hyperloop One for development of a hyperloop system. In April 2022, the hyperloop proposal stalled pending the technology's approval from the federal government. Two months earlier, Virgin Hyperloop announced it would lay off half of its staff and refocus its efforts to transporting freight instead of passengers.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately reflects the historical context provided by the images and accompanying text?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Examine the supplied text and corresponding images, conclude based on the synthesis of both, and respond to the inquiries presented.\nA mock taxidermy specimen of a fictional rhinograde invented by the German zoologist Gerolf Steiner\nFiction, especially science fiction, has created large numbers of fictional species, both alien and terrestrial. One branch of fiction, speculative evolution or speculative biology, consists specifically of the design of imaginary organisms in particular scenarios; this is sometimes informed by precise science.\n\n## Functions  \nFictional biology serves a variety of function in film and literature, including the supply of suitably terrifying monsters, the communication of an author's worldview, and the creation of aliens for  biological parables to illuminate what it is to be human. Real biology, such as of infectious diseases, equally provides a variety of contexts, from personal to highly dystopian, that can be exploited in fiction.  \n### Monsters and aliens  \nA common use of fictional biology in science fiction is to provide plausible alien species, sometimes simply as terrifying subjects, but sometimes for more reflective purposes. Alien species include H. G. Wells's Martians in his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds, the bug-eyed monsters of early 20th century science fiction, fearsome parasitoids, and a variety of giant insects, especially in early 20th century big bug movies.  \nHumanoid (roughly human-shaped) aliens are common in science fiction. One reason is that authors use the only example of intelligent life that they know: humans. The zoologist Sam Levin points out that aliens might indeed tend to resemble humans, driven by natural selection. Luis Villazon points out that animals that move necessarily have a front and a back; as with bilaterian animals on Earth, sense organs tend to gather at the front as they encounter stimuli there, forming a head. Legs reduce friction, and with legs, bilateral symmetry makes coordination easier. Sentient organisms will, Villazon argues, likely use tools, in which case they need hands and at least two other limbs to stand on. In short, a generally humanoid shape is likely, though octopus- or starfish-like bodies are also possible.  \nMany fictional plants were created in the 20th century, including John Wyndham's venomous, walking, carnivorous triffids. in his 1951 novel The Day of the Triffids, The idea of plants that could attack an incautious traveller began in the late 19th century; the potatoes in Samuel Butler's Erewhon had \"low cunning\". Early tales included Phil Robinson's 1881 The Man-Eating Tree with its gigantic flytraps, Frank Aubrey's 1897 The Devil Tree of El Dorado, and Fred White's 1899 Purple Terror. Algernon Blackwood's 1907 story \"The Willows\" powerfully tells of malevolent trees that manipulate people's minds.  \n### Optimism and pessimism  \n<ImageHere>H. G. Wells's 1898 The War of the Worlds struck a pessimistic note about human evolution.\nA major theme of science fiction and of speculative biology is to convey a message of optimism or pessimism according to the author's worldview. Whereas optimistic visions of technological progress are common enough in hard science fiction, pessimistic views of the future of humanity are far more usual in fiction based on biology.  \nA rare optimistic note is struck by the evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane in his tale, The Last Judgement, in the 1927 collection Possible Worlds. Both Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 Childhood's End and Brian Aldiss's 1959 Galaxies Like Grains of Sand, too, optimistically imagine that humans will evolve godlike mental capacities.  \nThe grim possibilities of Darwinian evolution with its ruthless \"survival of the fittest\" has been explored repeatedly from the beginnings of science fiction, as in H. G. Wells's novels The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Dr Moreau (1896), and The War of the Worlds (1898); these all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival. Aldous Huxley's 1931 novel Brave New World is similarly gloomy about the oppressive consequences of advances in genetic engineering applied to human reproduction.\n\n### Biological parables  \n<ImageHere>The protagonist's journey across Mars in Stanley Weinbaum's 1934 A Martian Odyssey\nThe literary critic Helen N. Parker suggested in 1977 that speculative biology could serve as biological parables which throw light on the human condition. Such a parable brings aliens and humans into contact, allowing the author to view humanity from an alien perspective. She noted that the difficulty of doing this at length meant that only a few major authors had attempted it, naming Stanley Weinbaum, Isaac Asimov, John Brunner, and Ursula Le Guin. In her view, all four had impressively full characterizations of alien beings. Weinbaum had created a \"bizarre assortment\" of intelligent beings, unlike Brunner's crablike but extinct Draconians.  What united all four writers, she argued, was that the novels centred on the interactions between aliens and humans, creating deep analogies between the two kinds of life and from there commenting on humanity now and in the future. Weinbaum's 1934 A Martian Odyssey explored the question of how aliens and humans could communicate, given that their thought processes were utterly different.  \nAsimov's 1972 The Gods Themselves both makes the aliens major characters, and explores parallel universes.  \nBrunner's 1974 Total Eclipse creates a whole alien world, extrapolated from terrestrial threats.  \nIn her 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin presents her vision of a universe of planets all inhabited by \"men\", descendants from the planet Hain. In the book, the ambassador Genly Ai from the civilised Ekumen worlds visits the \"backward- and inward-looking\" people of Gethen, only to end up in danger, from which he escapes by crossing the polar ice cap on a desperate but well-planned expedition with an exiled Gethenian Lord Chancellor, Estraven. They are ambisexual with no fixed gender, and go through periods of oestrus, called \"kemmer\", at which point an individual comes temporarily to function as either a male or a female, depending on whether they first encounter a male- or female-functioning partner during their period of kemmer. The invented biology reflects and exemplifies, according to Parker, the opposing but united dualities of Taoism such as light and darkness, maleness and femaleness, yin and yang. So too do the opposed characters of Genly Ai with his carefully objective reports, and of Estraven with his or her highly personal diary, as the story unfolds, illuminating humanity through adventure and science fiction strangeness.\n\n### Structure and themes  \n<ImageHere>\"The leafy sea dragon\" (actually weedy seadragon) from  William Buelow Gould's Sketchbook of fishes, c. 1832, used by Richard Flanagan in his 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish\nModern novels sometimes make use of biology to provide structure and themes. Thomas Mann's 1912 Death in Venice relates the feelings of the protagonist to the progress of an epidemic of cholera, which eventually kills him.  \nRichard Flanagan's 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish makes use of the illustrations from artist and convict William Buelow Gould's book of 26 paintings of fish for chapter headings and as the inspiration for the various characters in the novel.\n\n## Realism  \nThe geneticist Dan Koboldt observes that the science in science fiction is often oversimplified, reinforcing popular myths to the point of \"pure fiction\". In his own field, he gives as examples the idea that first-degree relatives have the same hair, eyes and nose as each other, and that a person's future is predicted by their genetic code, as (he states) in Gattaca. Koboldt points out that eye colour changes as children grow up: adults with green or brown eyes often had blue eyes as babies; that brown-eyed parents can have children with blue eyes, \"and vice versa\"; and that the brown pigment melanin is controlled by around 10 different genes, so inheritance is along a spectrum rather than being a blue/brown switch. Other authors in his edited collection Putting the Science in Fiction point out a wide variety of errors in the portrayal of other biological sciences.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts a concept that explores the potential consequences of genetic engineering in human society?\nChoice list: \nA.

        "question": "Inspect the imparted background and connected images, infer from the collective information, and provide solutions to the questions asked.\n<ImageHere>Snake decoration on a pot from Rumailah\nImportant Iron Age centres in the UAE have rendered an unusual richness in finds to archaeologists, particularly the spectacular metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid in what is today Dubai. Other important Iron Age settlements in the country include Al Thuqeibah, Madam, Bidaa bint Saud, Ed-Dur and Tell Abraq.\n\n### Iron age aflaj  \nRecent finds of pottery in Thuqeibah and Madam have further linked the development of early aflaj (or qanat) water systems there to an Iron Age II date, further substantiating the attribution of the innovation of these water systems to a southeastern Arabian origin based on the extensive archaeological work of Dr Wasim Takriti around the area of Al Ain.  \nThe 2002 publication of a paper by Tikriti, The south-east Arabian origin of the falaj system, provided the first counterpoint to the long-accepted narrative, that the Qanat originated in Persia and was identified as such by accounts of the campaigns of the Assyrian King, Sargon II, in 714 BCE. Tikriti cites this and also accounts by the Greek second and third century historian Polybius as being the basis for academic attribution of the technology to Persia. He notes academics such as JC Wilkinson (1977) adopting an Iranian origin for the technology under the influence of Sargon's annals and Polybius, but points out at least seven Iron Age aflaj (plural for falaj, the word used to denote waterways of this type in the United Arab Emirates) recently discovered in the Al Ain area of the UAE have been reliably carbon dated back to the beginning of the first millennium BCE. Additional to finds of Iron Age aflaj in Al Ain, Tikrit pointed to excavations in Al Madam, Sharjah, by the French archaeological team working there, as well as by a German team working in Maysar, in Oman. Tikriti is at pains to point out that, despite long-standing efforts since the 19th century to excavate qanat systems in Iran, no evidence has been found for any such qanat there dated earlier than the 5th century BCE. He concludes that the technology originated in South East Arabia and was likely taken to Persia, likely by the Sasanian conquest of the Oman peninsular.  \nOthers have followed Tikriti's lead. In 2016, R\u00e9my Boucharlat in his paper Qan\u0101t and Falaj: Polycentric and Multi-Period Innovations Iran and the United Arab Emirates as Case Studies, asserted that the attribution of the technology to Iranians in the early first millennium BCE is a position that cannot longer be maintained. He asserts that the carbon dating of alfaj in Oman and the UAE to the ninth century BCE by Cleuziou and evidence for such an early date provided by Tikriti are definitive. Additionally, Boucharlat maintains that no known Iranian qanat can be dated to the pre-Islamic period.  \n### Burials  \nIron Age burials at Jebel Buhais, particularly the group of graves defined as BHS 85, are thought to be linked to the nearby Iron Age settlement site of Al Thuqeibah. The site was originally excavated by teams from the Autonomous University of Madrid in the mid-1990s. Thuqeibah has been dated from the Iron Age II and III periods (1100\u2013400 BC). A settlement consisting of a number of houses and a well, it has been associated with a nearby Iron Age falaj system, thought to date from the Iron Age II era. 1st Millennium aflaj have also been unearthed at nearby Al Madam.  \n<ImageHere>Iron Age dagger from Qattara\nThe site of Rumailah, in Al Ain, like many in the UAE spans a wide period with finds dating back to the Umm Al Nar period, but shows a flourishing during the Iron Age. Finds at Rumailah include distinctive pottery adorned with snake patterns, similar to finds at Qusais, Masafi and the major Iron and Bronze Ages; metallurgical production centre at Saruq Al Hadid, as well as chlorite vessels decorated with turtles alternating with trees, similar to finds from Qidfa' in Fujairah, Qusais in Dubai and Al-Hajar in Bahrain. A number of Iron Age swords and axe-heads, as well as distinctive seal moulds, were also recovered from the site. A number of bronze arrowheads were also found at the site. The Iron Age buildings found at Rumailah are typical of those found in the region, at Iron Age I and II sites such as Al Thuqeibah and Muweilah, with a number of row dwellings, although lacking the perimeter walls found at Thuqeibah. A columned hall at Rumailah provides a further link to Muweilah, while a number of pyramidal seals found at Rumailah find an echo with similar objects discovered at Bidaa bint Saud.  \nOne of the most significant Iron Age sites in the UAE is Muweilah, located in the Sharjah suburb of Al Jurainah, near Sharjah University City. A large, fortified settlement thought to have been occupied during the Iron Age II period (1100\u2013600BC), the site has been explored by archaeologists since Muweilah was first identified in a survey conducted by the French Mission to the UAE in 1989, and excavated by an Australian expedition, which started work there in 1994 after the discovery of pottery shards by a local resident. It has yielded the oldest known example of writing found to date in the UAE, a pottery shard with an inscription, thought to be Sabean, with the letters 'bml'.\n\n## Saruq Al Hadid  \n<ImageHere>Gold jewelry from Saruq Al Hadid\nThe Saruq Al Hadid site in the desert south of Dubai was a centre of constant human habitation, trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600\u20132000 BCE) to 1,000 BCE, when it was a major location for smelting bronze, copper and Iron. Arguably its most important period of flourishing was as a metallurgical centre in the Iron Age II period (1100\u2013600 BCE). One of the many thousands of finds to be documented at the site was an ornate gold ring, which became the inspiration for Dubai's Expo 2020 logo.  \nSome of the many enigmas surrounding the site are its location far from sources of water, ore or firewood, all critical elements to a metallurgical centre. An abundance of pottery and metal artifacts have given rise to speculation of possibly identifying the site as a centre of snake worship. In all, over 12,000 unique objects have been unearthed at the site. A number of key finds are on public display at Dubai's Saruq Al Hadid Archaeology Museum in Al Shindagha, housed in a traditional barjeel (wind tower) building constructed in 1928 by Sheikh Juma bin Maktoum Al Maktoum.\n\n## Pre-Islamic Recent  \nArchaeologists have relatively recently defined a stratification of the pre-Islamic (previously sometimes referred to as 'Hellenistic') era in the Emirates' archaeology into four distinct Pre-Islamic Recent ages: PIR A (350 BCE - 150 BCE); PIR B (150-0 BCE); PIR C (0 BCE to 100 CE) and PIR D (100CE - 350 CE). These definitions have been applied particularly to sites where constant phases of occupation and disruption occur in the pre-Islamic, post Iron-Age era such as Mleiha in Sharjah and the related site of Ed Dur in Umm Al Quwain.  \n## Post-Islamic finds  \nArchaeologists have worked on post-Islamic era sites across the UAE, particularly in Ras Al Khaimah (the coastal settlement of Julphar) and the East Coast. On the East Coast, in Fujairah, the village of Bidayah has been the focus of a number of explorations of its mosque and the remains of a Portuguese fort, discovered in the village by a team of Australian archaeologists. The fort, originally called 'Libidia', was identified from a 16th-century map. Its walls were constructed using rock recovered from a nearby tower dated back to the third millennium BCE. These walls, some 60 metres in length, are joined in a square with towers on each corner and stand today at a height of up to a meter. Finds at the site of the fort include locally made pottery dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries and charcoal samples unearthed were carbon dated to 1450\u20131600, within the context of the Portuguese presence in the Gulf.  \nThe Bidayah mosque's date of construction is uncertain and because the mud and stone built structure uses no wood, radiocarbon dating is not possible. It is estimated to date to the 15th century, however some much earlier estimates have been proposed. The site was investigated by the archaeological center of Fujairah in co-operation with the University of Sydney from 1997\u201398. and Fujairah Archaeology and Heritage Department came up with the conclusion that the mosque was believed to be built in 1446 AD, along with the two watch towers overlooking the mosque and the village.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts an artifact from the Umm Al Nar period?\nChoice list: \nA.

During testimony before the House panel on the military assessment of nuclear deterrence requirements, Selva said that over the past decade some consideration had been made to defer some nuclear force in order to modernize them to address urgent needs, while also maintaining a safe, reliable and secure nuclear arsenal and delivery capability. He said that the Joint Chiefs need to affirm the necessity to maintain the nuclear triad and to modernize the weapon system, the indications of warning, and the command and control associated with the nuclear triad. Selva spoke about the possibility of a \"Terminator weapons conundrum\" and believed that some of America adversary had prepared to create artificial intelligence-like weapons. He also said that the Department of Defense was working with experts on ethics in order to study the threat posed by this kind of weapon and what will happens when technology is brought into the execution of warfare.\n<ImageHere>alt=\nAs vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), which was in charge of Joint Requirement Oversight Committee and Defense Acquisition Board, Selva reasserted the need of increasing defense budget for 2017. During testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Selva defended the 2017 budget request and acknowledged the challenges to come. Selva also made clear that the Joint Chiefs were satisfied with the 2017 budget proposal during the Senate hearing.  \nOn May 16, 2017, General Selva was renominated for a second term as vice chair of the JCS  \nIn March 2017, General Selva told the US Congress that Russia had deployed a missile barred by treaty and had launched it in order to scare their neighboring NATO members countries. According to Selva, the Russian act violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. He was also concerned over China's military buildup in the Asian Pacific and emphasized their development of capabilities with the potential to compete United States military-technological advantages. Selva also said that the Chinese have shown its willingness to exploit their economy as leverage to advance their regional political objectives and as China's military modernization continues, the United States and its allies and partners nations will continue to balance the challenge and threat that China's carries. He further noted that a long-term and sustained presence is critical in order to demonstrate that the United States is committed to the Asia Pacific region, and emphasized that the United States will continue to develop a security network through multilateral partnership and will continue to develop capabilities to counter China's threat.\n<ImageHere>Selva visiting Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor on September 21, 2015\nIn July 2017 following the increasing tension between the United States and North Korea, Selva stated that North Korea could become a nuclear arms proliferator. He stated that although there is no evidence that North Korea had engaged in proliferation of their long-range ballistic missile technology, it was clear that North Korea have proliferated every other weapons system that they've ever invented. In October 2018 Selva stated that the Pentagon was planning to use satellites in order to defend the United States against enemy hypersonic weapons such as intercontinental ballistic missiles. The remarks came one day after the Defense Department revealed their final steps toward creating the new military branch Space Force, which include establishing a Space Development Agency.  \nIn June 2019, when the tension between the United States and Iran increased following the attack of an oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, Selva warned that Iran should steer clear of United States interests. But he said that the United States wouldn't mount a unilateral military response against Iran unless U.S. forces or interests within the region are targeted. According to Selva, any military response to the tanker attacks would require an international consensus before military force was used.  \nIn July 2019, Selva retired.

Since 1984, international tourism receipts have grown from $117 million to $136 million in 1987, and $577 million in 1993. Such phenomenal growth has made tourism the leading source of foreign exchange in Costa Rica.  \nThe growth linkage possibilities of ecotourism development have had, consequently, far reaching effects on other sectors of the economy. For example, \u201ca visit to the Carara Biological Reserve entails not only a $15 entrance fee and possible additional donation, but also a flight into San Jos\u00e9's International Airport, a bus ride to the park, a stay in a local hotel, dining in the town's restaurants, and the purchase of souvenirs from street vendors\u201d (TED). To this extent, the ecotourism industry has had a trickle-down effect, bringing added revenues to rural and previously disadvantaged areas.  \nLess obvious growth linkages of ecotourism can affect everything from the communications industry to agriculture. The successes of Costa Rica's ecotourism industry have also helped breathe life into the nation's sagging coffee market. Tourists consume an average of two cups of the nation's gourmet coffee a day adding up to approximately 22 million cups of coffee a year, which, at 75 cents per cup, brings in about $16.5 million. Therefore, as many Latin American nations are losing jobs and revenue to falling coffee prices caused by an influx of cheaper Asian brands into the market, Costa Rica has managed to stay afloat with this increase in domestic consumption.  \nWith a rise in ecotourism and benefits to other industries, locals were relocated and logging industries shut down and Costa Ricans were able to turn to the tourism industry for employment. This would not have been possible if Costa Rica had adhered to former protectionist measures that tended to wall off protected areas from the public.  \nEcotourism in Costa Rica has also helped \u201cdiversity the national economy, which previously depended upon the exportation of a few agricultural products, namely coffee, bananas, meat, and sugar, for 65% of its exports.\u201d Like many countries in Central America, Costa Rica's small internal market and scarcity of raw materials make industrialization a slow and difficult process without much room for expansion.\n\n### Costs  \n<ImageHere>Canopy walkway in the cloud forest in Santa Elena, Costa Rica\n\n<ImageHere>Zip line in the cloud forest near Arenal Volcano\nEcotourism can be source of generating economic development at a local level; however, quite often, it has also resulted in the disruption of local economic activities. As history has shown, ecotourism has not only disrupted local economic activity, but oftentimes, the economic benefits of ecotourism in a particular area do not accrue to the local community. Instead of locals being compensated for switching to professions in the tourism industry, they oftentimes receive jobs that are low paying (although better paying than farming) and limited in their potential for upward mobility as managerial positions go to foreigners or urban-educated elites.  \nProfit leakage and exploitation are other possible factors that could affect the economic viability of Costa Rica tremendously in the future. Many developing nations do not have the resources to construct the infrastructure necessary for tourism development, which leads them to turn to foreign corporations and international donors (Hicks, 2001). The widespread involvement of foreign investors can lead to a leakage problem in which the profits earned by the tourism sector do not stay in the country (Hicks, 2001). This case has been seen to unfold in Costa Rica, where investment is low but new infrastructure is needed, leaving the government no other choice but to resort to foreign aid.\n\n## Potential solutions  \nThe key to a successful ecotourism industry in Costa Rica, which must prevail in all of its individual facets, comes down to better implementation, monitoring and evaluation around the region. In detail, \u201cthere needs to be the establishment of a system that considers all aspects of ecotourism ranging from the biophysical to the social\u201d. The complexities surrounding a successful ecotourism industry cannot be understood or solved overnight as there are numerous stakeholders involved and various opinions to take into consideration; there must be a mutual understanding amongst all parties involved as to what a successful ecotourism industry looks like. With that said, more scientific studies related to the biodiversity of the parks, habitat and its disruption, park carrying capacities, pollution, visitation, and other similar issues will need to be conducted.  \nThere is no standard set of guidelines for ecotourism; it is vital that the government of Costa Rica works alongside certification programs to ensure a prosperous environment and economy for the sake of the nation\u2019s future. To illustrate, \u201cthe lack of certification poses a significant problem, for it means that ecolodges and other establishments are not answerable as far as the extent and success of their environmental efforts. Recycling programs, promotion of low-impact tourist activities, and support for conservation efforts are entirely voluntary once minimum existing environmental standards have been met\u201d.\n\nQuestion: Which image depicts an activity that directly contributes to the economic development of Costa Rica through ecotourism, by offering a unique experience that attracts tourists and generates revenue?\nChoice list: \nA.
