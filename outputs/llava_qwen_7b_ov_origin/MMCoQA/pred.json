History Context 4: Text: The United Nations Security Council \"power of veto\" refers to the veto power wielded solely by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States), enabling them to prevent the adoption of any \"substantive\" resolution. Abstention or absence from the vote by a permanent member does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. However, the veto power does not apply to \"procedural\" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. The permanent members can vote against a \"procedural\" draft resolution without blocking its adoption by the Council. A negative vote by a permanent member will also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although this is a \"recommendation\" to the General Assembly rather than a Resolution. The unconditional veto posessed by the five governments has been seen by critics as the most undemocratic character of the UN. Critics also claim that veto power is the main cause for international inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, the United States refused to join the United Nations unless it was given a veto. The absence of the United States from the League of Nations contributed to its ineffectiveness.

Abstention or absence from the vote by a permanent member does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. However, the veto power does not apply to \"procedural\" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. The permanent members can vote against a \"procedural\" draft resolution without blocking its adoption by the Council. A negative vote by a permanent member will also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although this is a \"recommendation\" to the General Assembly rather than a Resolution. The unconditional veto posessed by the five governments has been seen by critics as the most undemocratic character of the UN. Critics also claim that veto power is the main cause for international inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, the United States refused to join the United Nations unless it was given a veto. The absence of the United States from the League of Nations contributed to its ineffectiveness.

History Context 2: Text: The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is a species of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from Virginia via the Gulf Coast of the United States south through most of the coastal New World tropics. This particular ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species. Question: name of black and white bird with orange beak Answer: American white ibis.  History Context 3: Table: <ImageHere> Question: Was Aves or Trofense, the club where Ginho had higher league appearance? Answer: Aves.  Current Context: Text: The sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six eggs. The pair mate every day or two, and every second or third day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large, thick-shelled, green eggs. The shell is around 1Â mm (0.04Â in) thick, but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous Australians. The eggs are on average 13Â cm ÃÂ 9Â cm (5.1Â in ÃÂ 3.5Â in) and weigh between 450 and 650Â g (1.0 and 1.4Â lb). The maternal investment in the egg is considerable, and the proportion of yolk to albumen, at about 50%, is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size. This probably relates to the long incubation period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching. The first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu. The egg surface is granulated and pale green. During the incubation period, the egg turns dark green, although if the egg never hatches, it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun.

Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill.

United also suffered disappointing exits in both the EFL Cup and Champions League, bowing out to Bristol City and Sevilla respectively by 2-1 scorelines. Throughout the season, manager JosÃ© Mourinho was criticised by sections of the media and a small section of United supporters for a perceived negative playing style, this despite having a wealth of attacking options and completing the signing of Alexis SÃ¡nchez in January.

He is a low-key, mild-mannered person, but has many sensitive qualities. At most times he is the exact opposite of Cameron which usually causes disagreements. Cameron acts as a counterbalance to Mitchell's uptight, worrying ways. Because of his mild-mannered, uptight nature, he is sometimes embarrassed by Cameron's flamboyance. He is uncomfortable with public displays of affection, as well as invasion of his personal space. He is an overprotective and cautious father. He is shown to be a capable lawyer, even representing an entire building full of people one-by-one with no prior notice. A recurring theme on the show is Mitchell's relationship with his father, which was strained by the revelation of Mitchell's homosexuality. Mitchell is a musical theater fan and enjoyed ice skating as a kid, though he later admitted that he liked working with his sister as a team more than the ice skating itself. Although he fancies himself as a handyman, everybody is afraid of him around tools.

Current Context: Text: The Kings are one of the oldest continuously operating professional basketball franchises in the nation. They originated in Rochester, New York, as the Rochester Seagrams (a semi-professional team) in 1923 and joined the National Basketball League in 1945 as the Rochester Royals. They jumped to the Basketball Association of America, forerunner of the NBA, in 1948. As the Royals, the team was often successful on the court, winning the NBA championship in 1951. It, however, found it increasingly difficult to turn a profit in the comparatively small market of Rochester and relocated to Cincinnati in 1957, becoming the Cincinnati Royals. In 1972 the team relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, and was renamed the Kansas City-Omaha Kings because it initially split its home games between Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska. In 1975, the Kings ceased playing home games in Omaha and simply became the Kansas City Kings. The team again failed to find success in its market and moved to Sacramento in 1985.
