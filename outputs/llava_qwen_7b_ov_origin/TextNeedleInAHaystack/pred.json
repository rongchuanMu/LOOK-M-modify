But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income.  Which means anyone who wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right than most people would in a casual conversation.  In every field, technology magnifies differences in productivity. It might be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the language, and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in bottlenecks. Show them a lot of works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to choose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better taste.So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have to discard the concept of good art.  Partly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order to be successful.  Hiring too fast is by far the biggest killer of startups that raise money.

To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the third or fourth time he's asked to do something; by then, whoever's asking him may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do want whatever they're asking for.Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new things they hear about.  Graduate students who want jobs as professors of x will write dissertations about it.  Why does    John Grisham (King of Torts sales rank, 44) outsell Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice sales rank, 6191)?

But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.Reporters like definitive statements.  I suspect a lot of people realized this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than becoming philosophy professors.How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are interesting questions.  At one extreme is the \"day job,\" where you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what you love in your spare time. To hack is a transitive verb — hackers are usually hacking something — and in practice languages are judged relative to whatever they're used to hack.  <ImageHere> [1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.

Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that it gets compiled into machine language.  I think hacking is more like architecture.  Probably just thirty, if I could pick them,  would be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub.[2] Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource most of the work of selection.

There will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.I confess I did it myself in college.

In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define is effectively an operator.  It is true that all they really care about is doing interesting work.

If not, just don't take the first meeting.  But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something you can fix by writing library functions.[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top; it's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial order.[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.

In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  <ImageHere>  This way you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code, but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would be in a traditional research department. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it.   3.  I don't mean to imply they're all to be avoided.  Instead of obliterating your idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into a tree.The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people tend to be smart in distinctive ways.Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want.  The kids think their parents are \"materialistic.\" Not necessarily.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren't expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score goals.  But by no means impossible.  And that probably drove the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered. That's the whole point of technology.

Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of.  We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders. Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long touchdown pass. And yet there is undeniably a grim satisfaction in hunting down certain sorts of bugs.May 2003If Lisp is so great, why don't more people use it?  I was     asked this question by a student in the audience at a  talk I gave recently. Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are like. If we treat data structures as if they were functions on indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorter than the Perl form.  <ImageHere> That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world. In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything false (\"6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment\").  So if you ask a great hacker how good he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know.  There was not much point in making more than you could hide.  Meanwhile the iPhone is selling better than ever. Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.  But people like numbers. Sometimes a whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad.  Miss out on what? They didn't know.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  <ImageHere> At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone.  You can't hire that kind of talent.  (How hard can it be?)The Common ThreadAjax, democracy, and not dissing users.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec) coming into our offices. And probably for the same reason: that the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous lives.If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it.  So every macro in that code is there because it has to be. The most important part of design is redesign. Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning a given distance with the least material.  <ImageHere> When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you can always tell. Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they're first launched — programming languages especially.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  Some ideas are easy for people to grasp and some aren't.  Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path?  You often can't tell yourself.  In theory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far universities seem to be indispensable.  Most recipes for wisdom have an element of subjection.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most important quality would be intelligence.  I wasn't trying to meet people; I was just having lunch.  The startup hubs in the US are all young-feeling towns.  The only credible contender is Android. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Cairo number?",

I think what's happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological leverage.  That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. For example, they like well-preserved old neighborhoods instead of cookie-cutter suburbs, and locally-owned shops and restaurants instead of national chains.  This may be an impossible dream.  Web 2.0 means using the web the way it's meant to be used.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're wasteful.If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.  <ImageHere> Indeed, such crossovers tend to be particularly promising.[2] I'm not claiming this principle extends much beyond math, engineering, and the hard sciences.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for writing software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway programs, because that is the larval stage of most software.5.  But since their size made them perfect for use in high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the impression the short story was flourishing.  A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart, and there will probably be survivors from each group.What does that mean for founders?  One thing it means is that the high valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever.  They go to school to study A, drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after taking it up on the side.Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness.  Read their job listings.  In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers. But I don't think that physical books are outmoded yet.  <ImageHere> You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you've got so far.People who do good work often think that whatever they're working on is no good. [18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting.  This essay is about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in that direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I thought I was going to write about writing.Note too that hill-climbing (which is what this algorithm is called) can get you in trouble. [2]Such ideas are not guaranteed to work.  They're just postponing it. The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that the people studying the classics were, if not wasting their time, at least working on problems of minor importance.And so began the study of modern literature.  I wrote this on an IBM laptop.[2] They did turn out to be doomed.   But for some reason we treat this skill differently. In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing jobs that boosted the median income.  <ImageHere> To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you're actually quite sure of.  This is true to a degree in most fields.  But now it worked to our advantage.  Just not now. The word \"paradigm\" is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted.  What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  You either get rich, or you get nothing.  Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good.  In a notebook you can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages around it. An essay must tell readers things they don't already know, and some  people dislike being told such things.[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online.

In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it.  But this model doesn't work for software.  Among other things it gives you more options to choose your life's work from.There's not even a tradeoff here.  [2] Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.  Smoking rapidly became a (statistically) normal thing.  You have to be determined, but flexible, like a running back.  Later when things blow up they say \"I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.\"If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  <ImageHere>  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant.  Remove them and most people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who win lotteries or inherit money. Notes[1] Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success. This only seems unfair if it comes as a surprise.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like, but is disastrously lacking in others.Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with the usual sort of job.For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do, at least for programmers. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low.  <ImageHere>  No amount of discipline can replace genuine curiosity.  So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A.  If you write enough, it's inevitable you will.  That's why I write them.So there's another difference between essays and the things you have to write in school.  It's not something you read looking for a specific answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  [11] By the nineteenth century that had changed. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. It was kind of intimidating at first. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019.  <ImageHere> So I decided to focus on Lisp.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America. 94.[7] Some would say we depend on Aristotle more than we realize, because his ideas were one of the ingredients in our common culture. They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.  They've become more bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their original principles.  For example, if you asked random people on the street if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most would say something like \"Oh, I can't draw.\"  This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try.

We'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an  announcement  on my site, inviting undergrads to apply.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people to collaborate on a research project.  So you don't have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in the general case. There is already a good deal of syntax in Lisp.  They've become more bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their original principles. The special magic Santiago number is: 4883661 <ImageHere>  Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better. Just as houses all over America are full of  chairs that are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed 250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who've done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  But it's an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the most traffic. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam.  <ImageHere> Far, in fact, from it.  This essay is about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in that direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I thought I was going to write about writing.Note too that hill-climbing (which is what this algorithm is called) can get you in trouble. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty.  And yet does anyone who was there have any expectation those days will ever return?  I doubt it. That's becoming the test of mattering to hackers.There should be online documentation as well.   In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  The one saving grace was that    English courses tend to favor pompous, dull writers like Henry James, who deserve black marks against their names anyway. And that means, perhaps surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task: a program to automate some system administration task, or generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format to another.  <ImageHere> That sounds hipper than Lisp.  Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl.In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor  written in C++ and Perl.  And it's not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas aren't the ones that win. You never have to type an unnecessary character, or even to use the shift key much.Using big abstractions you can write the first version of a program very quickly.  Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver: people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies, and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  But is that more important than that they learn to write well?  And are English classes even the place to do it?  After all, the average public high school student gets zero exposure to   his artistic heritage.  (That sounds  familiar.)

One is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger, no matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  But that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to say no to drugs. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the bottlenecks. It is massive.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would be enough.[4] Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on e.g.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.

It may turn out that this whole battleground gets bypassed.  But the really striking change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have to decide which we prefer.  Mistake number one.  And that will cause the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually to erode.[4] Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round board, consisting of two founders and one VC.  When friends came back from faraway places, it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked them about their trip.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which is the prudent choice. In the first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able to solve it. [3]   And now that the web has evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff, the web wins net.  <ImageHere>  Suppose you approached investors with the following idea for a Web 2.0 startup:    Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to \"tag\" content   with descriptive tokens. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users.  Few people are suited to running a startup, and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand), so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the optimal state of affairs. [5] How much someone's work is worth is not a policy question.  <ImageHere>  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.  In the best case---if you're really organized---you're just writing it down.  In desperation people reach for the sledgehammer; if their kids won't listen to them, maybe they'll listen to God.  And although the first may be weakening because it's now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.  But those parentheses are there for a reason. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.  They work well enough in everyday life that you don't notice.  The most    successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff away for free. Maybe for the first couple hours.  If you don't seem like you have the potential to go public, you won't be able to use VCs to drive up the valuation of an angel round.There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called signalling risk. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.July 2006 When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad writers.  <ImageHere>  This doesn't mean they have to be new.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself I.  This must have affected what they said.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people to collaborate on a research project. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time leads to discontentment.That's particularly worth remembering.  Most founders doing series A deals would prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock after using the first half of the money to increase its value.  Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies.  Immediately Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they'd discovered. The special magic Belgrade number is: 3927828 <ImageHere>  But you can at least not repress them. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.  This includes mere conventions, like languages and safe combinations, and also what we'd call \"random\" facts, like movie stars' birthdays, or how to distinguish 1956 from 1957 Studebakers.[4] People seeking some single thing called \"wisdom\" have been fooled by grammar. The people who are interested in art learn about it for themselves, and those who aren't don't. If we treat data structures as if they were functions on indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorter than the Perl form.  They hope further investment will save them. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco.  <ImageHere> Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could find a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks.   3. Prose can be rewritten over and over until you're happy with it. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes [1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made the version number an integer.  About a year after we started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering starting another startup.  When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.This is especially true in a startup. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years.  It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Belgrade number?",

If you write enough, it's inevitable you will.  The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about the world.  But ambitious programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than going to work at a big company.  How much is that extra attention worth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another. They were an impressive group.  But they've been trained to expect the opposite.  In fact, if you admit to yourself that you're discontented, you're a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial. That's sort of true. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp.  <ImageHere>  With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good hackers when you meet them.  Users love a site that's constantly improving.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful about.Most people won't, unfortunately. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at what they do at home. But my instincts tell me you don't have to worry much. It is so much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother. data.  \"They think the decline is cyclic,\" he said.  In a society of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a sign of an underlying problem. But I could be wrong. The special magic Kigali number is: 5442976 <ImageHere>  There were about 7.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new startup he was involved with.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users. And even then you'd still see some disagreement.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches polarity. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.YC was not organized as a fund.  <ImageHere>  Most good startup ideas seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone would have done them already.(How many people are going to want computers in their houses? What, another search engine?)That's the connection between technology and liberalism. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no one is forced to use it.  Nerds are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes from the rest.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing. Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.  He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.  In other words,   time-sharing is back. For expert hackers, that really is a problem.  It was the people they never got.  A professor at a famous university who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much regardless of the proposal. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

Heirs will be on the parental dole for life. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. Prose has readers, but software has users.  So how do you know when you're working on real stuff? [8]I know how I know. The most amusing thing written during this period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is, I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.Around 1000 Europe began to catch its breath.  <ImageHere> That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be.

Now, most people who are rich enough not to work do anyway. For every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.This number comes from a study of 133,733 families at 28 different hospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better Birth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Harvard T.H.

Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is this how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter.

If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. [3]The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John D.  Never make users register, unless you need to in order to store something for them.  But there's a big difference between nothing and almost nothing, when it's multiplied by the area under the sun.  That's why I write them.So there's another difference between essays and the things you have to write in school.   So you won't attract good hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create for them. I found that in a lot of classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape to make good exam questions.  <ImageHere>  At most startups ten years ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in C++. Programming languages are not theorems.  But it's an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases.  Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes. They're always flying on instruments.[5] Hall, Rupert. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn't like. In fact, the language encourages you to be an equal participant in its design. Prose has readers, but software has users. In politics, for example, crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it.  <ImageHere> They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is only moderately appealing. A hacker's language is terse and hackable. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.  In fact, let's make it an RFS. 3.  It's very valuable in practice to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand.

If there's some mundane problem getting in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive, just take it and get on with more important things.  That would have saved me in all three cases. That will tend to drive your language to have new features that    programmers need.  And there is a role for mathematical elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard.  Sometimes young programmers notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.  <ImageHere> It's not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere's no controversy about which idea is most controversial: the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a problem as we think.I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a good thing.  Your results will speak for themselves. The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate. It would be a good thing if macros could generate format specifiers the way they generate any other kind of code.An eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open to the section format.  But by the modern era such questions were answered as well as they were ever going to be. A popular programming language should be interactive, and start up fast.Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity.  But it's certainly possible to do things that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you can probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.  <ImageHere> There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem.  The books I bring on trips are often quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assigned reading in a college class. [4]Paradigms don't just define our present thinking. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. Using first and rest means 50% more typing.  So cultivating intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's character—some tendency to be interested in certain types of things—and nurturing it. But there are some domains where performance can be measured, and in those detecting bias is straightforward.  The closest you can get is to show that the official judges of some class of texts can't distinguish them from placebos.   Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the      individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using   graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the   reputation of each member.  <ImageHere>  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd written years before that might say something I needed to remember, if I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something to read.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.But I had some more honest motives as well. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. [12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. They grab your sleeve as you're staring at your phone and say \"will you play with me?\" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise.

There may be a similar problem with the way we work:  a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working  with startup founders.  You can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons, though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust bloggers more than Business Week.I was talking recently to a friend who works for a big newspaper. But it's not enough merely to be correct. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.  <ImageHere> What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. Lisp's power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don't get it.If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn't worry that it isn't widely understood. I'm inclined now to think it was the salt. Much as a vaccine can be. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal.   Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores.  Hiring people is rarely the way to fix that.  And that's why less popular languages, like Jane Austen's  novels, continue to survive at all. The dream language is  beautiful, clean, and terse.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the government.[4] People commonly use the word \"procrastination\" to describe what they do on the Internet.

When I walked into the final, the main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions would turn up on the exam.  I hardly ever go back and read stuff I write down in notebooks. So were the early Lisps.  Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. But in practice I don't think fast code comes primarily from things you do in the design of the language.  Lisp wasn't designed to fix the mistakes in Fortran; it came about more as the byproduct of an attempt to axiomatize computation. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly.  The kids see to that.  But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.  Here's an intriguing possibility.  <ImageHere> You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993.  Pen and paper wick ideas.The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.  It's this fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the detail, we could just program in machine language.Remember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time has come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him. But Android is an orphan; Google doesn't really care about it, not the way Apple cares about the iPhone.

He was Gorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein gave it.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to.  Which doesn't mean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  Oh boy!  They make such great stuff. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke.

So a town that could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot.  Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh.In our world some of the most characteristic solutions are not far removed from practical jokes.  And not in the trivial sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language. And yet this principle is built into the very structure of   the essays they teach you to write in high school. vii.39) says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was 700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis, but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own freedom.Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices.  <ImageHere> So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.   But their tastes can't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\" The thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas, cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  They won't kill you unless you let them.Nor will most competitors.  You can measure this in your growth rate. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019.  Or more precisely, in Trevor's office. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can't want to want what you want.That's still not quite true.  <ImageHere>  I bet a lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor, like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them out by switching to a risc instruction set.Ordinarily technology changes fast.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been.  By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online.  A lot of people in their early twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even faster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.  But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund.  It's more a question of self-preservation.  <ImageHere>  It's an unusual thing to do.  He once told a Sunday school class    Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never   took the first drink. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. One got extra credit for motives having to do with class, as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and   sexuality.  I suspect five hundred would be enough, even if they could bring no assets with them. [2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.  But by the modern era such questions were answered as well as they were ever going to be.  A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house. Bookstores are one of the most important places for learning about new languages.3 BrevityGiven that you can supply the three things any language needs — a free implementation, a book, and something to hack — how do you make a language that hackers will like?One thing hackers like is brevity.  <ImageHere> Imagine how incongruous the New York Times article about suits would sound if you read it in a blog:    The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,   prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--   is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace. So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a really good programming language.  (So I went back to America.)It is greatly to America's advantage that it is a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks. If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you have more freedom of choice.Which route should you take?  That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your lifetime) for what you want to do. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Damascus number?",

Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or heresy.[3] Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse. But they may not realize that such laws will do more harm than good.Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night, I'd want to go out and investigate.  No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there working on the same thing.That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it. 5.  A government that asks \"How can we build a silicon valley?\" has probably ensured failure by the way they framed the question. In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of addicts do outside the doors of office buildings.  <ImageHere>  And the reason everyone doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower.  The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords.  Fortunately if this does happen it will take years.The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which is good news for you.  In my case they were effectively aversion therapy.  And that means there may be a struggle ahead.  It has to be planted in the right soil, or it won't germinate.  That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects. [2]Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it.  But this model doesn't work for software. But in Silicon Valley it seems normal.  <ImageHere> And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will.  Design is not just for humans, but for individual humans.  The startup hubs in the US are all young-feeling towns.  At least, it seems likely enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  So if you want to make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the \"creative class\"-- you probably have to ban large development projects. To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.  Apple leaves no room there.   So it's a harder problem than Hall realizes. The unusual thing about Lisp  in fact, the defining quality of Lisp  is that it can be written in itself. And although intentional moderates might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though in their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are also acquired in bulk. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me.  Now that Lisp dialects are among the faster languages available, that excuse has gone away.  <ImageHere>  If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs in 1975, he was ready._____ How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about essay writing. It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support himself. Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the organizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble to aggregate it.  The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken.  The things I've written just for myself are no good.  Particularly to young companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long enough to have grown big yet.  <ImageHere> The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. If he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much food. We know who one another are.10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders. Cryptography did this to number theory. Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough.Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  Now that route is closed.  It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lagos number?",

He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.And since his work became the map used by generations of future explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well. Many evolve into real programs, with real features and real users.I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way, rather than being designed big from the start, like the Hoover Dam. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored.  But a place that tolerates oddness in the search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because economically that's what startups are. And yet I think I know what they mean.  What was special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were experts in technology.  It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  <ImageHere>  I suspect this kind of organic growth is the only way to produce a startup hub, because it's the only way to grow the expertise you need.That has two important implications.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is how to pick it.  But when you lose that protection, e.g.  They remind us where we come from.  You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.  That's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first couple bites feels great. Maybe for the first couple hours. Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliar syntax. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object.  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  If not, just don't take the first meeting.  <ImageHere>  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately large percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that the very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is identical to the question, how do you design a good programming language?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting question.3.  Is that all it takes? That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley. If someone were talking about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens in the immune system of each individual person.  But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think \"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\" It would set off alarms.  <ImageHere> They can afford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding the launch has the side effect of making them celebrities. Not good enough, but better. He always seems to land on his feet.  You have to build a shield around it, or it will fry you.The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be useless if it were.  The top US Computer Science departments are said to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon.  After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her.  If you wanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for example, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would be the place to do it.  If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same. FriendshipEmpirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just  one founder. What's really going on is that you have different expectations for yourself.  Each group tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals that humans were designed to work in.  <ImageHere>  A lot of people in their early twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even faster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.  I can edit an essay or debug code in an airport. The state of the art in programming languages doesn't stand still. And it's true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty.But qualifications are not scalars. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice.  The topic sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting  paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the conclusion--- uh, what it the conclusion?  I was never sure   about that in high school.

You don't need anyone's permission.It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years, till some change makes it explode.  Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup.  We had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of my parents smoked. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing.  We told him we'd fund him if he did something else.  Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing.  You also can't tell from their resumes. And it's likely to. The special magic Bucharest number is: 1911890 <ImageHere>  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky to get paid three times as much. We lived in the Unix world. May 2002)  (This article came about in response to some questions on the LL1 mailing list.  Most programmers are told what language to use by someone else.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it.  They control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce.  Your brain is much the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit it. [5] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it.  I hadn't read the books we were assigned carefully enough.  Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters.  But this is old news to Lisp programmers.  <ImageHere> When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. I wonder how large this group has to be; how many users make a critical mass? Off the top of my head, I'd say twenty. A lot of the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT at some point.  It was pretty advanced for the time.  Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub.   (In some Lisps expressions can return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortran and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between expressions and statements.It was natural to have this distinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a language where the input format was punched cards) the language was line-oriented.  Another is when you have to customize something for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.  <ImageHere> I've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. You want to be optimistic and skeptical about two different things.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores, so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles.   [3]Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have less partner per investment.  There's nothing more valuable than the advice of someone whose judgement you trust.  In an opera it's common for one person to write the libretto and another to write the music.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't save you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  <ImageHere>  To make a startup hub, you need a lot of people interested in startups.There are three reasons.  Angels are individual rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called super-angels.  The bigger the community, the greater the chance it will contain the person who has that one thing you need most.The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub is that once you have enough people interested in the same problem, they start to set the social norms.  And journalists as part of their professional code segregate themselves from the revenue-collecting half of the businesses they work for (the ad sales department).  So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.  Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  Whereas when the problems you have to solve are random, they seem like noise. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bucharest number?",

I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California.  As computers have grown more powerful, the new languages being developed have been moving steadily toward the Lisp model.  But I think all of us in the computer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on.Thanks to Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Sarah Harlin for reading earlier versions of this talk.  My God, it was so simple. For companies that offer server-based applications, it will make a very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can support per server.In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor, and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize.  <ImageHere>  And the fact that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof that it has started to mean something.One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still only just bear to use without scare quotes.  We're not hearing about Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows apps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming languages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for our work.2.  A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100? [1]Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. The special magic Seattle number is: 4018797 <ImageHere>  But when you lose that protection, e.g.  Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca. When I was in grad school in Boston, a friend came to visit from New York. And when you're part of an organization whose structure gives each person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you're going to face resistance when you do something new.This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.  But the new version number led to some awkwardness in the short term. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single person—the workers and manager would each share only one person's worth of freedom between them.In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were one person.  <ImageHere>  But a place that tolerates oddness in the search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because economically that's what startups are. Surely all smart people would be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.Because philosophy's flaws turned away the sort of people who might have corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating. In that world, the hardware and software will be supplied together. If you're the one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there's a hole in your model of the world.  Which is also to the founders' advantage if it means they still control the company.[5] In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you dilute yourselves to set aside an \"option pool\" as well. Garbage-collection.6. But general and surprising is a hard combination to achieve.  That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings.  <ImageHere>  which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.January 2003(This article is derived from a keynote talk at the fall 2002 meeting of NEPLS.)Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that Americans like to begin a conversation by asking \"what do you do?\" I've never liked this question.  [5]This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive and yet naive and mistaken. I say, let them; give the programmer access to as much internal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems like the garbage collector.In Common Lisp I have often wanted to iterate through the fields of a struct — to comb out references to a deleted object, for example, or find fields that are uninitialized. And yet it is convenient, especially when you're generating code, to have operators that take any number of arguments.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seattle number?",

But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same. And that implies that HN was a mistake.  I would not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway programs. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain experts.  And regardless of the case with CEOs, it's hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional basketball players don't reflect supply and demand.It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really generate so much more wealth than another. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Knuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical bottlenecks. Then I'm worried.  <ImageHere> It might be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the language, and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in bottlenecks.  If your thesis was well expressed, what need was there to restate it?  In theory it seemed that the conclusion of a really good essay ought not to need to    say any more than QED. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can't want to want what you want.That's still not quite true.  [5]What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.  It never gets any easier.  What makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on. Bookstores are one of the most important places for learning about new languages.3 BrevityGiven that you can supply the three things any language needs — a free implementation, a book, and something to hack — how do you make a language that hackers will like?One thing hackers like is brevity.  <ImageHere> That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.  How?What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of situations.  You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life.  We now have several examples to prove that amateurs can    surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to  channel their efforts. Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages are more popular.(Beware of such reasoning.  A lot of the change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed.It took a while though—on the order of 100 years. It was future startup founders. The special magic Lisbon number is: 1464960 <ImageHere>  You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor.  A doctor, P.  When you travel to a rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank accounts to tell which kind you're in.  Imagination is hard to measure, but in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured in lines of code.Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it varies so much.  I know because I've seen it burn off.Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that convinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small group, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to. They're in 165 hospitals now.  <ImageHere>  An article about Sophia Antipolis bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and Nortel.  In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.[16] Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich have better opportunities for education.  They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders.  They're like someone stuck in an abusive relationship. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lisbon number?",

I thought in Basic. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. But only if you keep going. That gap between us was not imaginary.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at what they do at home. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.  <ImageHere>  Tribes of hunter-gatherers have much more freedom.  Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd written years before that might say something I needed to remember, if I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something to read. These people need your help. In fact, users expect a site to improve. Prose has readers, but software has users. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything else.  <ImageHere>  They may have to use Java and Windows at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular language can be misleading. They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate R&D department where employees don't have to work directly on customers' nasty little problems.  But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France, where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced. It can't be something you have to install before you use it. And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of things that are easier to do before you have them than after.  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work.  I'm surprised people don't talk more about it.  If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.Ok, so life actually is short. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. The special magic Seattle number is: 6118302 <ImageHere> [3]   And now that the web has evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff, the web wins net.  Life tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.  But ambitious programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than going to work at a big company. A new Lisp would be a natural step in this progression.I sometimes think that it would be a good marketing trick to call it an improved version of Python.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house on a little island off the coast of Maine. May 2002)  (This article came about in response to some questions on the LL1 mailing list.  So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start successful startups. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income. So I decided to focus on Lisp.  <ImageHere>   [4]  Since board seats last about 5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once, that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner per year. If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real.Getting there can't be easy.    We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of   pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests   of contradictory and confusing truths. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.July 2006 When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad writers. If everything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of m.

We may never do that much better, for the same reason 1980s-style \"knowledge representation\" could never have worked; many statements may have no representation more concise than a huge, analog brain state.[2] It was harder for Darwin's contemporaries to grasp this than we can easily imagine. And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a motivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially cash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you are now competing directly with Google.   [5]But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that they cause less dilution.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Their tastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a lot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist destinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.  <ImageHere>  In England in the 1060s, when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon nobles to his followers, the conflict was military.  But in general, for application software, you want to be using the most powerful (reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a lesser degree, as programming in machine language.You can see that machine language is very low level.  But prudence can't tell me what sentence to write next.  It was a picture of an AS400, and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're not just making a technical decision. They're perfectly justified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a waste of time, and eventually go away. Sometimes you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did already exist. 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.  Smart people will go wherever other smart people are.  <ImageHere>  It took me years to grasp that.JobsBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon. And that means they need to get as much of the company as they can in each one. The path it has discovered, winding as it is, represents the most economical route to the sea.The river's algorithm is simple.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves so they can get the most done.  But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss represents your entire group.  <ImageHere> Microsoft helped kill it, but it would have died anyway.  None of them would have been there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain reaction.I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to   track them at work. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit.  And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded yet.  But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure. And so once university English departments were established in the late nineteenth century, the 'riting component of the 3 Rs  was morphed into English.  He explained that he'd just bought it in Thailand.The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  They make investment decisions quickly, like angels. They seem wrong.  Founders arriving at Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees. The special magic Athens number is: 3282426 <ImageHere>  If I had children, it would arguably be immoral not to.  Then you want to do something else—even something mindless.  It's not mystery meat cooked up out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into  molds of zippy journalese.  If programmers used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop apps for that instead.How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone? It's unlikely you could make something better designed. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In the first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able to solve it. In fact it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained not just new answers, but new questions.  I think if you looked around you'd find that   a lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Athens number?",

Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. People who work for startups start their own.  It could be simply that many famous scientists worked when collaboration was less common.Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  Design is not just for humans, but for individual humans.  And whether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  Designing systems of great mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us than pandering to human weaknesses.  But as a medium of expression, you could do a lot better. And yet I can't write a general purpose function that I can call on any struct. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other.  <ImageHere>  Perhaps, if design and research converge, the best research is also good design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups.  Even hackers can't tell. AjaxDoes \"Web 2.0\" mean anything more than the name of a conference yet?  I don't like to admit it, but it's starting to. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying.  Venture investors are driven by exit strategies.  Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but they miss the critical point: it's good enough. I think future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs.  But ITA made it interesting by  redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  All the people majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain knowledge.  He applied to YC with  some bad ecommerce idea. I wanted to build things.  <ImageHere>   [4]People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize what a leap it must have been when they first started to. Needless to say, my imitations didn't say anything either.In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things.  They wouldn't do it otherwise. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp. Though the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about 2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500 years old, because for most of that time the leading practitioners weren't doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato or Aristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invading army.  At about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics. For example, they'll almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll take it.  How can you get anything done in them, I think, without macros? [5]Many languages have something called a macro.  <ImageHere>  In some ways, this assumption makes life a lot easier.The difference between design and research seems to be a question of new versus good. He wasn't that much older than me, and was super rich.  It has to be planted in the right soil, or it won't germinate. Starting a startup will change you a lot. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt.  A successful running back doesn't just put his head down and try to run through people. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life.  And the best paying jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles.  <ImageHere> What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. I took several classes in logic.  I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be both.To do something well you have to love it.  The control systems inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.  We couldn't believe large numbers of people would want to stay in other people's places. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a  marginal medium at first. for getting both is the same.

Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world. I'll make them all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll just be able to say: number four! 1. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok.  Do we have free will?  Depends what you mean by \"free.\" Do abstract ideas exist?  Depends what you mean by \"exist.\"Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical controversies are due to confusions over language.  Most of the people who've had to write PhD disserations about Dickens don't.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express rank. Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L-word.  EBay didn't win by paying less for servers than their competitors.Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a growth industry in the mid twentieth century.  <ImageHere>  Wouldn't it start to seem lame?  [3]They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them.  And certainly  Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay about color or baseball.How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go back almost a thousand years. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine.  It was impressive even to ask the questions they did. It must be terse, simple, and hackable.  Sometimes young programmers notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.  Pliny (Hist.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot about things that matter,\" I wrote \"become good at some technology.\" But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  <ImageHere>  San Francisco and Berkeley are great, but they're forty miles away. Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.[6] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. They were an impressive group. The whole language always available. So while it's not possible to have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The company that says they're going to buy you isn't.  That no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.  <ImageHere> [1] Which means applicants of type x who do make it through the selection process will outperform other successful applicants. But it's the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings.  Signalling risk smells like one of those things founders worry about that's not a real problem.  By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went.  Even a company with 100 people will feel different from one with 1000.Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

In a traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC fund takes a seat on your board. We'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an  announcement  on my site, inviting undergrads to apply.  It's true even in the smartest companies. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects have in common. 92.[15] Frankfurt, Harry, On Bullshit,  Princeton University Press, 2005.[16] Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any particular truths you'll learn.  <ImageHere>  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved to Palo Alto to do it.  Most people could do better. Mine too.     They're not part of the conversation.Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as news. When Lisp was first invented, all these ideas were far removed from ordinary programming practice, which was dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.Over time, the default language, embodied in a succession of popular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp. But because the product is only moderately appealing, growth is ok but not great.  It's a rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers have iPhones. The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.* * *How did Apple get into this mess?  Their fundamental problem is that they don't understand software.They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through iTunes.  <ImageHere> If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start.   But their tastes can't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\" The thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas, cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  That would be kind of amusing.1. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice.  IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequences of the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical \"adversary\" must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by redefining it as one that's easier to solve.Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they can get away with.  <ImageHere> It's an important skill in its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. The most important part of design is redesign. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice these tend not to give you everything you want. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf.  What do they all have in   common?  I didn't realize they had anything in common till recently, which is one of the reasons I disliked the term \"Web 2.0\" so much. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it does.Like it or not, programming languages are also for people, and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic as the human body.  <ImageHere> If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs. You don't see all the false starts. Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading  drafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming.   That idea is not exactly novel. $1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number of lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially new, but I'm excited about its potential. \"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.

I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a bad human rights record. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.  But I think I have finally solved the problem. There's something like an efficient market here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct, have the biggest effect. In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions (e.g.  But as technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading a book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but also to index and even edit them.  <ImageHere> Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't know any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants to buy you. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been.  I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous.  <ImageHere>  He explained that he'd just bought it in Thailand.The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it. And if they have deep domain expertise, that's probably the source of it.  The word \"regressive\" as applied to tax rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything regressive be good?[9] \"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.  Meanwhile the iPhone is selling better than ever.  And lately hackers  have sensed a change in the atmosphere.  That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you to stop looking. Cambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels young because it's full of students.What you can't have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a large, existing population of stodgy people.  <ImageHere> I wanted to build things. Whether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors, it probably isn't), it tended to pervade the atmosphere of early universities.  Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might come from going to drunken parties.Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people's eyes. IdeasSo if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders.  In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how much effort it costs. The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more because he grasps the underlying principles.  But after the talking is done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and   design can't?  This is an interesting question.  <ImageHere> Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.  If I'm right, then it really pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.  They're way more dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security.  And since human nature limits the size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work together the way components of a market economy do.That might be worth exploring. At the moment I'd almost say that a language has to have a book published by O'Reilly. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky.  England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious new things they could do.  Frankfurt's distinction between lying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic San Francisco number?",

Ideally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) proved they weren't identical.The definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the process not to starve. But elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses, I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers. Wanted:  Woman with hammer.Notes[1] When Google adopted \"Don't be evil,\" they were still so small that no one would have expected them to be, yet. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans.  Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum.  <ImageHere> But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel investing.  The control systems inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams. In one way, it is.  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  Though indeed, making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the end, just as automating things often turns out to generate more jobs.The ultimate target is Microsoft. All you have to do is keep telling your story, and eventually people will start to hear.  Now the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it?  It always will when you're trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide you.  With trend stories, PR firms usually line up one or more \"experts\" to talk about the industry generally.  Public schools probably couldn't stop teaching English even if they wanted to; they're probably required to by law.  <ImageHere>  How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn't even have y.By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one.  His skills are simply much more valuable.I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot about things that matter,\" I wrote \"become good at some technology.\" But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  If anyone should know this, Apple should.  This is not just a heuristic for detecting bias.  Instead of version 1s to be superseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts to be mastered and discussed. A symbol type. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since.  <ImageHere>  The threshold may be whether what you write has a title. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally.  You couldn't just do what you wanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. Their format is convenient, and the de facto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfect filter. Early Lisps let you get your hands on everything.  Sometimes I even make a conscious effort to visualize the place beforehand, so I'll have a detailed image to diff with reality. But Rtm was right, as usual. There's something like an efficient market here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct, have the biggest effect. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp.  <ImageHere>  So if you remember only the title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to know about M&A in the first year.Notes[1] I'm not saying you should never sell.  An article about Sophia Antipolis bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and Nortel. One of the guests was someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned.  It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python or Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would outsource their development to India. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seattle number?",

Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up.  Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing. Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are. You're helping them, and you're writing.  In a traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC fund takes a seat on your board.  But I don't think they'll be able to. Just don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  <ImageHere> In Lisp, functions are first class  objects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings, etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables, can be passed as arguments, and so on.3.  The mystery comes mostly from looking for something that doesn't exist.  His skills are simply much more valuable.I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health. Cobol is notorious for this flaw. I've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  I'm sometimes accused of meandering.  The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. It's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more \"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets.We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want to\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point.  <ImageHere> The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had to be built on NT.  That principle, like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,    turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long forgotten origins. This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York, where people walk, but not smiling.  I suspect there are already some highly partitionable businesses that lean this way. I think future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. NaughtinessThough the most successful founders are usually good people, they tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  <ImageHere>  It is still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids' way into top colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the college admissions process.According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian schools.  In such situations it's helpful to have a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know. [5] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it.  If you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries will make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.  It's exciting to chase things and exciting to try to guess answers.  There is something very American about Feynman breaking into safes during the Manhattan Project.  <ImageHere> I would not be surprised if it is harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.  No web startup does. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.  The disadvantage of this route is that it's slow and uncertain.  That's what bit me.   That idea is not exactly novel.  The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.    Whether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting where the firm as a whole says yes or no.  Predecessors like \"understanding\" seem to have had a broader meaning.[6] There is of course some uncertainty about how closely the remarks attributed to Confucius and Socrates resemble their actual opinions. You delete it and try again.  When people say \"Web 2.0\" now, I have some idea what they mean. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Dakar number?",

But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious.  And while it  makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies,  studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about  hitting outliers, are not one of them.  Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. The special magic Lisbon number is: 2382122 <ImageHere>  And I'm sure for every startup founder or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online.  I'm not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek.  And then there was the mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines n' Cream was so appealing.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. Introducing change is like pulling off a bandage: the pain is a memory almost as soon as you feel it.Everyone knows that it's not a good idea to have a language designed by a committee.  When you're starting a startup that depends on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're trying to ignore you out of existence.  <ImageHere>  But even to people who don't believe in gods, life commands respect. And if you're doing really well, you can safely talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high, and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll be confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle.  I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous.  In fact things have gone in the other direction. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.A concrete example: Lisp macros.  And I think that's precisely why people put it off. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.  A young architect has to take whatever work he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position to pick and choose among projects.  <ImageHere>  One is that these users are the people they want as employees.  Many of the students who now major in English would major in writing if they could, and most would be better off.It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be exposed to their literary heritage.  On the way we met Rajat Suri.  It would be a bad sign if they weren't; it would mean you were being too easy on them. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work. It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives, because that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten who discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter.  <ImageHere>  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints, partly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and partly so I don't worry about losing them.I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago. Gay marriage, for or against?  This group says one thing.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our heroes should be. Early Lisps let you get your hands on everything.  How was the place different from what they expected?  This is an extremely useful question.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain. There's no reason a new Lisp shouldn't have string libraries as good as Perl, and if this new Lisp also had powerful libraries for server-based applications, it could be very popular.  [10]And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected it was a waste of time just studied other things. The whole language always available.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lisbon number?",

On the whole, his advice is good.  It has to be planted in the right soil, or it won't germinate.  This site isn't lame. A hilarious article on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the    matter:    Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces   for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they   began blogging in the first place. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before  English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him.  They'll listen  to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard.  <ImageHere> They're more like examples of Robert Frost's \"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances of good design together, but within each individual project, one person has to be in control.I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think of everything. It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary between developer and user.  If you work hard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you'll quit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when you quit and then discover that you don't actually like writing novels?Most people would say, I'd take that problem. Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense. The special magic Madrid number is: 1021853 <ImageHere>  There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious. Or that's what it feels like. It seemed obvious that this was the future. To many people, Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses. thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.Sometimes I can think with noise. I've often had a juicy bug to track down.  This metaphor doesn't stretch that far.  The only way to say whether something is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence, and structurally philosophy is young; it's still reeling from the unexpected breakdown of words.Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500.  It does seem likely there's some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this predisposition is not itself intelligence.One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable.  Except he didn't.  <ImageHere>  And unless the rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to protect us.   But the staff writers feel obliged to write something more balanced, which in practice ends up meaning blurry. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. Which means of course that it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann sum.The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about a lot. If they're going to build something, they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building an iPhone app.So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple continues to maltreat them.  <ImageHere>  It was English.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at what they do at home.  The most powerful wind is users.  It doesn't even have x (Blub feature of your choice).As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. I'm not trying to discover anything new.  That's what happened with domestic servants. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned. [1]A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out.  But they're wrong.  There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic.  One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader   something he didn't already know. I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wanting to like classical music.\" But we're getting closer to the truth.  Bill Bradley had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Madrid number?",

One sense of \"normal\" is statistically normal: what everyone else does.  But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're bad.The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.  The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which people suffered in complicated ways. They rush to develop a product, launch it with great publicity, and immediately (they hope) have a large user base.Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys.  Both make sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  <ImageHere> In the past, a competitor might use patents to prevent you from selling a copy of something they made, but they couldn't prevent you from taking one apart to see how it worked. ExpertiseThe second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important to know a lot about startups.  Which means it is very much worth reading important books multiple times.  A few years before, there was no such thing as a freelance programmer. It's odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical.  [10]And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected it was a waste of time just studied other things. I was right about that part.  <ImageHere>  And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them things they already knew.  If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what.Almost everyone's initial plan is broken.  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  It does seem likely there's some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this predisposition is not itself intelligence.One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable. The special magic Toronto number is: 5890369 <ImageHere> Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work.   Bottom-up programming suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people work as toolmakers.  If parents will let their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.  Startup investors are a distinct type of rich people. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.)  The kind of power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more powerful language in it. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job.  I was walking in some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  <ImageHere> \"Normal\" food is terribly bad for you.  You can get the software for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that programming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  [2] Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish.  The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.  It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center of gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confident enough to treat Aristotle's work as a catalog of mistakes.  At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Toronto number?",

But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. Thanks to the Cambridge Union for inviting me, and to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. [3]The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions, because there's a real mystery here.  It's there to some degree in almost every field, but I had till then managed to avoid facing it.That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting: you have to figure out for yourself what's  good.  I personally am interested in writing a language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the additional suggestion that the application should not consist of writing the compiler for your language, unless your language happens to be intended for writing compilers.]4.  The conference itself didn't seem very grassroots.  And it's not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas aren't the ones that win.  <ImageHere>  The ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine publishing.  Doing what you love is complicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. In retrospect, was there anything interesting about working in Baskin-Robbins? Well, it was interesting to notice how important color was to the customers.  Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might come from going to drunken parties.Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people's eyes. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be.  <ImageHere> It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery. I didn't write essays.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten who discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter. That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.  Many of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids.  Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork.  [10] Like serfs, the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth.  The people who've worked for a few years do seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only because they're that much older.The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of conservative.  <ImageHere>  Within the US, there are no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least, first-rate computer science departments.So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a university, but one of the top handful in the world. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too.  More often than not it makes it harder.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll have almost as much freedom as the founders. People who work for startups start their own. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.  What worries him about Google is not the power of their brand, but the fact that they have better hackers.  Universities with x departments will subscribe to the journals. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong.Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. The special magic Almaty number is: 5510511 <ImageHere>  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users. Some arrive feeling sure they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few, artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic.  That's the myth in the Valley.  But I'm willing to let people see an early draft if it will show how much you have to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.Below is the oldest version I can find of The Age of the Essay    (probably the second or third day), with text that ultimately survived in  red and text that later got deleted in gray.  So unless you're fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job career.  Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed.

An undergrad who gets something published feels like a star.  Now we admire the genius.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good hackers avoid nasty little problems.  You turn the fan back on, and the noise starts again.  It's people writing what they think.I didn't realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was.  Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being a painter, and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it snapped the leash of credulity.  This seems to me one of the most interesting differences between research and design.There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts, but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather than nuclear fusion.  What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things seem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp. It's that death is the default for startups, and most towns don't save them. You never have to.  I think what's happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological leverage.  <ImageHere> It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. Worse still, anything you work on changes you.  You have to be smart too, right?  I'd like to think so, but I've had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent several years living in New York.You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won't kill you.  One thing is certain: the question is a complex one. It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast. Lisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and McCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation programs even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.  Now, most people who are rich enough not to work do anyway.  When people from Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having gone over to the dark side.  That's a separate question.  There were ashtrays everywhere. [1]You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  They confuse it with money.  <ImageHere> Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces.  For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and officials, they're at the mercy of their own imagination.LimitsTo me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups.   Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms   that have immediate approval processes.  Not for the first time, either.In languages, as in so many things, there's not much      correlation between popularity and quality.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  About a year after we started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering starting another startup.  <ImageHere> They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine.  This was perfectly true.  The way to come up with new ideas is not to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not discount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain experts. The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.  I was so disgusted with what we were doing that it became a point of honor with me to write nonsense at least as good at the other students' without having more than glanced over the book to learn the names of the characters and a few random events in it.I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the same problem there.  Perhaps, if design and research converge, the best research is also good design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.  <ImageHere> You'd also have a very boring life. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. The point is not just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading.  The active ingredient here is not so much the professors as the students.  Till one knows better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas it represents are hard to understand.  However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him curious.   I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is   \"I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store\", and it's   combined with the emotion \"Really, it's Apple's fault.\"  Another wrote:    I believe that they think their approval process helps users by   ensuring quality.  But as a medium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the forces that push you to overhire.

The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which people suffered in complicated ways.  If you can figure out a way to turn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry, so much the better, if all fifty million go to you.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock early would generally be better for the company, because it would cause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the VCs'. Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous because it teaches you so little about what you like.  At places like MIT they were writing programs in high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued to write code in machine language well into the 1980s. This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York, where people walk, but not smiling.  <ImageHere>  \"As Secretary of State and the leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, [he] was a special recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch not to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make peace.\" (Stone, op.  If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses of $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that would bear comparison with any in the world. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. It's the number of people something matters to, times how much it matters to them.  Do we have free will?  Depends what you mean by \"free.\" Do abstract ideas exist?  Depends what you mean by \"exist.\"Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical controversies are due to confusions over language.  People will write operating systems for free.  I'm not proposing the primary goal of education should be to increase students' \"self-esteem.\" That just breeds laziness.  <ImageHere> When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you can always tell.  But I didn't realize till the last   few years that writing for publication didn't have to mean writing that way.  But as startup investors they'd have to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own investment decisions.  The moment I do, I'll have people nagging me for features.[3] A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application in this respect.  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users. Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be any syntax for it. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k).  <ImageHere> For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it.  We're all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.  For example,  I've written a few macro-defining macros full of nested backquotes that look now like little gems, but writing them took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I'm still not entirely sure they're correct.We often act as if the test of a language were how good finished programs look in it.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications.  No one proposes that there's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple thousand people each.  But they're looking for a way out.  Our bodies weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise.  You'll remind them of themselves.  <ImageHere> Even in Confucius's time it still seems to have been the first duty of the scholar.[10] The bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated by the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about such matters. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income.  That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn't like. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented.  A doctor, P. To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive VCs, they'll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and start to become more miserly about valuations.  Most college graduates still think they have to get a job. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Los Angeles number?",

They like reading novels. Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.YC was not organized as a fund.   [14]  The singularity I've described is not going away.  In the process of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that \"2.0\" referred to.  For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby.  You could not nest statements.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  <ImageHere>  Particularly to young companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long enough to have grown big yet. The next generation of computer technology has often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing what they expected to be the next generation of business computer.  We've even had a twin study: West Germany, on;  East Germany, off.  But I think I have finally solved the problem. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones.  Hardy's boast that number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it. Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at what they do at home.  A physicist friend recently told me half his department was on Prozac.  <ImageHere>  (The use of the term \"recitation\" for sections in some colleges is a fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that they're too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.DifferentI deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it's worth being wise.  If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what.Almost everyone's initial plan is broken. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked.  Since high school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as   sources of information. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them?The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.  <ImageHere> If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6 years to go public.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there generating it. Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no one were willing to do them.Two RoutesThere's another sense of \"not everyone can do work they love\" that's all too true, however.  Ron Conway had angel funds starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First Round Capital is closer to a super-angel than a VC fund.[2] It wouldn't cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on investments that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage of startups as they do now. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. I make a new version almost every day that I release   to beta users.  <ImageHere>  When he was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.  But then he makes a mistake—possibly the most important mistake in the history of philosophy.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is this how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter.  If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of thinking was.  A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100? [1]Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones.  But my guess is that we shouldn't be afraid to call the new Lisp Lisp. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations, if it was not too expensive.4. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Shanghai number?",

We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf.  A herd of impalas might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  If you lack commitment, it will seem to you that you're unlucky.Whereas if you're determined to stick around, people will pay attention to you, because odds are they'll have to deal with you later.  Which means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3 man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100 million to acquire. But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own.  We hoped that would save us.  But that's not the same as just being able to do what you want, like you could before.A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that they're less stressful to raise.  Not least because they're determined to fight. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many.  <ImageHere>  When you're deciding what to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.  The \"flow\" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms.  A top-ranked professional chess player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player without losing once.Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very specialized skill.  It is also palpably short.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. But I think that's ok. I certainly didn't realize this when I started writing the  essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.    And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus group than hackers, because they come closest of any group I know to embodying it. So you get a language that talks down to you.  <ImageHere>  Though indeed, making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the end, just as automating things often turns out to generate more jobs.The ultimate target is Microsoft.  You already know where you're going, and you want to go straight there, blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving your way across swampy ground.  It's hard to say how much is because big companies made them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that made them work for the big companies in the first place. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC.  The reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it.  Microsoft is a bad data point. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything.  By the 1530s, when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his followers, it was mostly political.  <ImageHere>   8, which (with 9) is what makes Lisp macros possible, is so far still unique to Lisp, perhaps because (a) it requires those parens, or something  just as bad, and (b) if you add that final increment of power,  you can no  longer claim to have invented a new language, but only to have designed a new dialect of Lisp ; -)Though useful to present-day programmers, it's strange to describe Lisp in terms of its variation from the random expedients other languages adopted.  Which means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type x. A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs may not give you an elegant design process.  The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors.  It sounded promising. cit., p.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.  Because in fact the distinction we began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.  Their model of product development derives from hardware.  <ImageHere> I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school I never read the books we were assigned. For example, by doing things that don't scale, or by redesigning the product in the way only founders can. [7]Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed.  And that's exciting because it means lots more startups will happen. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels both right and wrong at the same time.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some competitor tried to spam our web designers.  It doesn't work for an intermediary to own the user. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Doha number?",

In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition; it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you're still working for salary. The most amusing thing written during this period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is, I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.Around 1000 Europe began to catch its breath. You see it in sponsored research too.  Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.  It probably takes at least a generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).  They make investment decisions quickly, like angels.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session was about. I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books a package tour.  <ImageHere> There's a whole world there that's barely been explored. Not fast, but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished.  It can be either a compliment or an insult. Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of the classic type.  Every language probably has a word meaning \"how one feels when things are going well,\" but different cultures react differently when things go well.  But I remember thinking his company's name was odd. I think that what you want in your language may be related to how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that operator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix syntax.  At our startup we had  Robert Morris working as a system administrator.  It would be a bad sign if they weren't; it would mean you were being too easy on them.   So to the extent you can preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it well.  <ImageHere>  Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies. Good PR firms use the same strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth favors their clients.For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web   let small merchants compete with big ones. Real hackers won't turn up their noses at a new tool that will let them solve hard problems with a few library calls. How did things look to them, when the new idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it was only half-convinced it was right?But you don't have to stop at history.  All the time, if you think in Lisp.  People who value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  No one after reading Aristotle's Metaphysics does anything differently as a result.  When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. They don't just compete for startups; they also compete for investors.  This will sound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.  <ImageHere>  But what if the person in the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball? (Thump, thump, thump...  And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets like MIT and Stanford.This sounds hard. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared. I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein.  Each is, by itself, enough to kill you. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most.  <ImageHere>  Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration.  But is that more important than that they learn to write well?  And are English classes even the place to do it?  After all, the average public high school student gets zero exposure to   his artistic heritage.  We may not be able to optimize for both simultaneously.Society seems to have voted for intelligence.  I think this is true for the sciences generally.  But friends should be your compass.[5] Donald Hall said young would-be poets were mistaken to be so obsessed with being published.  If there's some mundane problem getting in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive, just take it and get on with more important things. But only if you keep going. H.

But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying.  Those companies were apparently willing to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's drive.  [7] 6.  And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go.My strategy is loose, then tight.  He can do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him to foreign countries. There is a kind of pleasure here too. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely.  <ImageHere>  And if you're writing a short, throwaway program, you may be better off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task. They produce something, are convinced it's great, and never improve it.  But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years.  If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages.  But in practice it's as if RIM didn't exist.   There may be a similar problem with the way we work:  a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working  with startup founders.  <ImageHere> That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. I didn't write essays. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.  And if you're a technology company, their thoughts are your product.  It is now incorporated in Revenge of the Nerds.)When McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it was a radical departure from existing languages, the most important of which was Fortran.Lisp embodied nine new ideas: 1. A good deal of that spirit is, fortunately, preserved in macros.  A professor at a famous university who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much regardless of the proposal.  I saw him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people \"that guy looks just like Tim.\"\"Oh, that's Tim.  It was pretty advanced for the time.  <ImageHere> Though the nature of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict quite well what sort of people will make them.  I was trying to make it efficient.  If you had one, you were rich. 3. A popular programming language should be interactive, and start up fast.Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity.  We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses. Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long touchdown pass. What popularity it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the scripting language of MIT.  No one thought to go back and debug Aristotle's motivating argument.  You can measure this in your growth rate.  Miss out on what? They didn't know. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. [12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online.  <ImageHere>  And because of supply and demand, they pay especially well. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019.  And so instead of correcting the problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it—that you can easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas—they  continued to fall into it.The SingularityCuriously, however, the works they produced continued to attract new readers.  Many of these people never come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone else created earlier.  They're not.  So we used to pay a PR firm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  And so when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country, there is a tendency to worry that it's sliding back toward becoming another Venezuela.  Want to start a startup?

As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them.  The main character is an assassin who is hired to kill the president of France. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. You should always have a plan B as well: you should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll  have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.   That idea is not exactly novel. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts.It's like skiing in that way.  There's no consensus yet in the general case.  <ImageHere> Anything that can be implicit, should be.The individual tokens should be short as well.  I'm not proposing the primary goal of education should be to increase students' \"self-esteem.\" That just breeds laziness. For historical reasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist.  On the way we met Rajat Suri. But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. He didn't learn as much as he expected.  Also, you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will have more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing? That's what you're addicted to.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new startup he was involved with.  <ImageHere> It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult, and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy; it introduced students to cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark.  That's their secret.  A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages.  Then you want to do something else—even something mindless.  Those places have too much momentum in the wrong direction. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic.  Because in fact the distinction we began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.   But for some reason we treat this skill differently. But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying.   So you won't attract good hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create for them. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach.  <ImageHere> The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York. Sometimes you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did already exist. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. That's a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usually give up in a series A round if you do it so early. You're helping them, and you're writing. You don't pitch stories to them. Programming languages are not theorems.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. If a sentence doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and you've usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists.   We just don't notice usually, because they only have to compete against other bureaucrats.  <ImageHere> You're not sacrificing anything if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely to succeed if you wait.  During the 90s a lot of people    probably thought we'd have some working system for micropayments      by now. So I decided to focus on Lisp.  Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely.  And moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining control of their companies.You can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure that one will happen.  If Ron Conway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this..  Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Brussels number?",

If you disagree, try living for a year using only the resources available to the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us. Sometimes a whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad.  But I was never able to figure out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was killing all the potential startups.  Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth is something that has to be generated. The special magic Dakar number is: 9126835 <ImageHere>  It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model.  I was so disgusted with what we were doing that it became a point of honor with me to write nonsense at least as good at the other students' without having more than glanced over the book to learn the names of the characters and a few random events in it.I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the same problem there.  Forty-two years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to work for Intel.So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't make anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links back to Shockley.  Because in fact the distinction we began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want.  <ImageHere> If being good art really is a property of objects, it should be in the object somehow.  Now that route is closed.  Silicon Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl.  The \"trends\" we're seeing now are simply the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models that got imposed on it during the Bubble.I realized this when I read an  interview with Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen.  Idealistic undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child's model of wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past. These people need your help. The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish one another's papers.  If you wanted more wealth, you could make it.This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house.  <ImageHere>  It's hard to say how much is because big companies made them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that made them work for the big companies in the first place.  When friends came back from faraway places, it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked them about their trip. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly. [1]If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer.  I'd give Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge another shot in college.    Whether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question.  Similar sites include Digg, a technology news site that's rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and del.icio.us, the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" movement. At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be \"built out,\" and that's usually easier with fewer people.  <ImageHere> It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition.  Symbols differ from strings in that you can test equality by comparing a pointer.8.  But these aren't true collaborations.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not to stop and think how tired you are.   And we weren't the only ones they did great things for. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Dakar number?",

(1) Learn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect.  Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first.  He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it.  And I found that the best way to get information out of them was to ask what surprised them.  Ideally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) proved they weren't identical.The definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the process not to starve. In practice three or four \"want to\"s must surely be enough.  I don't think you can even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user.You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include the designer himself.  I hadn't read the books we were assigned carefully enough.  <ImageHere>  But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them.  Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a modern habit. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect   formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"  That has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even more convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A combination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  They're quite explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point where they would do a Series A round. I can only access the fields by name, because that's what a struct is supposed to mean.A hacker may only want to subvert the intended model of things once or twice in a big program. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools.  Chair designers have to spend their time thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. The special magic Beirut number is: 9469506 <ImageHere>  You may have as many as five or ten releases a day.  But an illusion it was. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better work very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the same way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the corresponding property. Another view is that a programming language really isn't a programming language unless it's also the scripting language of something. Just as houses all over America are full of  chairs that are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed 250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who've done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to them.  <ImageHere>  Instead of thinking of most places as being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with the antidote.Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do: fail. It has to be there. FlexibilityYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases like \"don't give up on your dreams.\"  The world of startups is so unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the fly. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager.  We didn't draw any conclusions.)Questions aren't enough. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose a major.  Software isn't like music or books.  <ImageHere> Though the nature of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict quite well what sort of people will make them. [2] For boys, at least, certain kinds of horrors are fascinating.  The recording industry hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible. If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty.  One of the reasons Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019.  And unless the rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to protect us.  The whole shape of deals is changing.One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount of your company they want.

By the time they reach an age to think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one's work.  But those you don't publish. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of syntax and semantics as being completely separate.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.

It's them you have to design your site for.  Among other things it gives you more options to choose your life's work from.There's not even a tradeoff here.  It's usually a mistake for a promising company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.But it's a mistake founders constantly make. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI.  You could have both now.  Then I had kids. I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school I never read the books we were assigned. These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands between them.  This was easier to grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  But that's not the route to intelligence.  <ImageHere>  It's not just social pressure that makes them; idleness is lonely and demoralizing.Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years ago. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to deal with prefix notation.  It was presumably many thousands of years between when people first started describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked \"what is heat?\"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.   We just don't notice usually, because they only have to compete against other bureaucrats. The special magic Almaty number is: 1243597 <ImageHere> I'm not trying to discover anything new. [4]Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting.  Hardy's boast that number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.  At some firms it's over 50%.Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to.  The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell your site is about.  No one in an industrialized country encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an adult.  They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. The internet is doing it to the essay.The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but that there's a lot left to discover.  <ImageHere> On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. A startup has to sing for its supper. Instead of thinking of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.  But you can go too far in any law, and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  And that's exciting because it means lots more startups will happen.  Who can say which of two novels is better?  Certainly not the authors.With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell. In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw. How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half the work of essay writing.

That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. Later, when you want to optimize, there's a really good profiler that tells you where to focus your attention. The App Store has changed that.  Imagination is hard to measure, but in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured in lines of code.Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it varies so much. Developers have been able to assume that each user would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their desk.  That principle, like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,    turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long forgotten origins. [11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small.  <ImageHere>  I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be both.To do something well you have to love it.  What attracts professors is good colleagues.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations.In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we do.     October 2010After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding business is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called turmoil.

What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?There are a couple reasons they should care.  It's not the kind of place nerds like.Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but no rich people.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session was about. Nothing could be better, for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters.  Oh boy!  They make such great stuff. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength.  <ImageHere>  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the rule rather than the exception. If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start. The libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits together like the parts in a fine camera.  I lived as if she'd always be there.  There was no uptake among hackers. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path.  We were all starting from scratch, so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big advantage. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.  Among them were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  Technological progress means making things do more of what we want.  <ImageHere> So yes, I wanted it! [7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans.  [3] But aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific without starting to be mistaken.Nor do we need to. He called this language Lisp, for \"List Processing,\" because one of his key ideas was to use a simple data structure called a list for both code and data.It's worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is tending to become in our own time.  Within the US, there are no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least, first-rate computer science departments.So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a university, but one of the top handful in the world.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it. This tradition continues today.

I'm not sure why. And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet seats.How do you avoid copying the wrong things?  Copy only what you genuinely like. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values. So she decided to compile a book of  interviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job.  So it does matter to have an audience.  <ImageHere> I say, let them; give the programmer access to as much internal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems like the garbage collector.In Common Lisp I have often wanted to iterate through the fields of a struct — to comb out references to a deleted object, for example, or find fields that are uninitialized.  Acquirers can be surprisingly indecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable from dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.Thanks to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff Ralston, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this.April 2006(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006  Startup School.)The startups we've funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem quicker to learn some lessons than others. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are.One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive. Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm.  <ImageHere>  When he wanted to go to work on a saturday, he found it easier to say that it was because he \"had to\" for some reason, rather than admitting he preferred to work than stay home with them.[3] Something similar happens with suburbs.  They use it because it yields the best results.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want.  But by no means impossible. Sometimes pretty overtly.  It's this fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the detail, we could just program in machine language.Remember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in.  Then you could see in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  I carried it home and plugged it in, and it booted.  Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first.It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do.  <ImageHere>  We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders. [5] My latest trick is taking long hikes. And if they have deep domain expertise, that's probably the source of it. It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary between developer and user. So this set me thinking. If you're talking to someone from corp dev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to sell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to get an offer at an acceptable price. I started studying painting. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online.  <ImageHere>  Perhaps it's because startups are less of a zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed by competitors. But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying. And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work  doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual currency of research papers. All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important job better than other languages.History offers some encouragement. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question.  which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.January 2003(This article is derived from a keynote talk at the fall 2002 meeting of NEPLS.)Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that Americans like to begin a conversation by asking \"what do you do?\" I've never liked this question. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Maputo number?",

If I say this, some will say it's a ridiculously overbroad and uncharitable generalization, and others will say it's old news, but here goes: judging from their works, most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their time. Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just that line but the whole program around it.  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.  For example, many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers.  Their model of product development derives from hardware.  It might be true that increased variation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say it's axiomatic.Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  But you can always make them break if you push them far enough.I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the central fact of philosophy.  <ImageHere>  Editing yields 95th percentile writing—95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are dragged down.  They're so desperate for \"content\" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.   (In some Lisps expressions can return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortran and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between expressions and statements.It was natural to have this distinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a language where the input format was punched cards) the language was line-oriented. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started.  All a city needs is to be the kind of place the next traitorous eight look at and say \"I want to stay here,\" and that would be enough to get the chain reaction started.Notes[1] It's interesting to consider how low this number could be made.  <ImageHere>  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. The path it has discovered, winding as it is, represents the most economical route to the sea.The river's algorithm is simple.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  Note too that Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. You're growing 7x a year.   But their tastes can't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\" The thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas, cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  It means arguments of the form \"Life is too short for x\" have great force.  <ImageHere>  Handy that, isn't it?Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher,  James Bracy, Gabor Cselle, Patrick Collison, Jason Freedman, John Gruber, Joe Hewitt, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Teng Siong Ong, Nikhil Pandit, Savraj Singh, and Jared Tame for reading drafts of this.January 2017People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked.  Life tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job. Treating indentation as significant would eliminate this common source of bugs as well as making programs shorter.Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read.  The people who've worked for a few years do seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only because they're that much older.The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of conservative. Just don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  <ImageHere> Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on, when they're trying to find their niche.Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest?  One is to try to do a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't like it.  But these aren't true collaborations.  Till one knows better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas it represents are hard to understand.  And as many programmers have observed since, one is very often mistaken about where these bottlenecks are.So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good profiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed. They may not care at all about questions that the left and right both think are terribly important.  In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Toronto number?",

In print they had to cut the last item because they didn't have room.)1.  Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them?The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.  How many even discover something they love to work on? A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.It's hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code.  <ImageHere> They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is only moderately appealing.  In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how much effort it costs.  It's more a question of self-preservation.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  It's why the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo, for example.  I still don't even have a flying car. Nothing is deprecated, or retained for compatibility.  I can't think of many ancient philosophers who would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes.\"The superior man is always happy; the small man sad,\" said Confucius. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't save you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage. I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it.  <ImageHere>  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want. [6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief.  Many of these people never come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone else created earlier.  I think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft.  And technology for targeting ads continues to improve. But anything to get users.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords.  <ImageHere> I was right about that part.  But airports are not so bad: most of the noise is whitish.  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run with it. Horace, Sat. The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it.  I wouldn't be surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an       ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to make as little money as possible.  The most powerful wind is users. Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a nearby fan.  In  Ansi Common Lisp I tried to move things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn't get to macros until page 160.But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.  <ImageHere>  I hadn't read the books we were assigned carefully enough. I.  They're doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big, bureaucratic companies. And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know his name.[8] Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this department.  No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there working on the same thing.That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered.  Many of the students who now major in English would major in writing if they could, and most would be better off.It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be exposed to their literary heritage. Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.Over in the arts, things are very different. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bangkok number?",

This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine.

For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.  An article about Sophia Antipolis bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and Nortel.  So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory where the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with good reason. Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories about them.  During the Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was    blowing through several million dollars of VC money to \"get big fast\" in the most literal sense.

To someone who hasn't learned the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive: as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope. Chan School of Public Health.Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the most conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number of lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.  It didn't work out as I'd hoped. Common Lisp is not.The good news is, it's not Lisp that sucks, but Common Lisp.  That's why I'd use the word naughty rather than evil.  I still don't even have a flying car.  And if you have really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying you the kind of problem that good people like to work on.Nasty Little ProblemsIt's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting: those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones.  <ImageHere>  They delight in  breaking rules, but not rules that matter.  No one after reading Aristotle's Metaphysics does anything differently as a result. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them.  1-5 are now widespread. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. [10]The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started.

Maybe it's not a coincidence.Hackers are unruly.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  <ImageHere>  Marble, for example, is a nice, durable medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one for developing new ideas.A program, like a proof, is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had false starts branching off all over it.

But I've learned never to say never about technology.  I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  Imagination is hard to measure, but in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured in lines of code.Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it varies so much. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Budapest number?",

But if you had to change something, what would it be?If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. Every popular mistaken belief creates a dead zone of ideas around  it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.The strength component just makes things worse.  If they could even get here they'd presumably know a few things we don't. But my instincts tell me you don't have to worry much. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice these tend not to give you everything you want. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well.  <ImageHere> vii.39) says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was 700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis, but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own freedom.Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices.  He explained that he'd just bought it in Thailand.The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup. TV has become much more engaging, and even so it can't compete with Facebook.The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. [12]Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have reached this stage.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  He couldn't have afforded a minicomputer.  <ImageHere> Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. [7]Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician who said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he hadn't made enough progress.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you're doing math. Of all the places to go next, choose whichever seems most interesting.I'm pushing this metaphor a bit.  Really they ought to be out there digging up stories for themselves.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  The other end of the spectrum is designing chairs.  Some of the startups that postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they raise that they never bother to raise more.  And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.  You could have both now. Worse still, anything you work on changes you. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.  <ImageHere>   [1]That's a striking departure from the past.  Even a concept as dear to us as I.  By \"feature\" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum of making users' lives better.As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really fast.\" Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Joe Gebbia, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.February 2007A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp.  And that will cause the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually to erode.[4] Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round board, consisting of two founders and one VC. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Colombo number?",

In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved for the language, suggesting that at least some of the designers intended to have more syntax in the future.One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp occurs in format strings; format is a language in its own right, and that language is not Lisp.  Technically the term \"high-level language\" doesn't mean anything very definite. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.  They're just postponing it.  Recursion existed as a mathematical concept before Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to support it.  In a rapidly growing market, you don't worry too much about efficiency. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from.Perl is a striking example of this idea. If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring intelligence.  <ImageHere>  Later when things blow up they say \"I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.\"If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. \"Look at those goddamn fleas, jabbering   about some disease they'll see once in their lifetimes. I knew intellectually that people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously  but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can't want to want what you want.That's still not quite true.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created    for other people to use.If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are that you're not designing something good, even for idiots.  But if you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  <ImageHere>  More often people who do great things have careers with the trajectory of a ping-pong ball.  As this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate.  It's the job equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  You may dispute either of the premises, but if a language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a toplevel, then no language that makes type declarations   mandatory could be convenient to program in.In practice, to get good design you have to get close, and stay close, to your users. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. In the first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able to solve it.  And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how anyone can get anything done with it.  <ImageHere> Particularly lions.  But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the growth never comes.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine languages, which themselves vary in power.Consider Cobol. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. works not just for evaluating new ideas but also for having them.  <ImageHere>  If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what.Almost everyone's initial plan is broken.  The toolmakers would have users, but they'd only be the company's own developers. They must hear developers complaining. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that  don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them.  O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web, and they were wondering what to call it.I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a new version of the web.  There hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared.  It was so clearly a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced to see the distinction.

If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand but vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea of words.His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  Actually he's no better or worse than he was before, but to a clueless audience like that, the approval of an official authority makes all the difference.  Those places have too much momentum in the wrong direction. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. The special magic Madrid number is: 8288125 <ImageHere> But they may not realize that such laws will do more harm than good.Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night, I'd want to go out and investigate.  Venture investors are driven by exit strategies.  [4] And not just to users.   When we cook one up we're not always 100% sure which kind it is.  This is largely a tautology but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually comes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  Fortunately if this does happen it will take years.The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which is good news for you.  Most unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to find the right sort of community.[3] Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.  <ImageHere>  All the hackers I know despise them.  There are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal disputes, inertia, and ignoring users.  I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000.  But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.Reporters like definitive statements.  But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain.  They can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this is not what you need to know.  Central France in 1100, off (still feudal).  It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you.  But when Bill Clerico starts calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not going away. There's a certain kind of idea that's best discovered by writing essays. Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss. Apple itself did.  <ImageHere>  And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. [1]If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer.  And it is also the essence of Americanness.  What makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on.  Which is exciting because among other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect bias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least a random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of applicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.How does it work?  Think about what it means to be biased.  And both groups are highly mobile. So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a really good programming language.  <ImageHere>  It can be either a compliment or an insult. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.  And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations.In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we do.  They can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this is not what you need to know.  Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C.  Users hate bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's more coming soon.There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast.  When a VC firm can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about which they do. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. The bumbler will shoot himself in the foot anyway. 2.  They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Madrid number?",

When you approach the problem from the direction of the arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of test.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some new things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based  apps get released.  It was the people they never got.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC investments is dictated by the structure of VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Young people don't want to live in the suburbs.Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned into new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland.  If anyone should know this, Apple should. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints.  <ImageHere>  I'm not proposing the primary goal of education should be to increase students' \"self-esteem.\" That just breeds laziness. A friend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone asks him.  So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A.  You also have to want them; you have to recognize them when you see them, and that's much harder. You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program.  In the Daddy Model, hard work is in itself deserving.  Students be forewarned: if you actually write the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad grades.  In practice the first phases of both consist mostly of unedifying schleps, and in (b) the second phase is less secure.Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Beau Hartshorne, Jessica  Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2004When people care enough about something to do it well, those who do it best tend to be far better than everyone else. The special magic Lisbon number is: 2810523 <ImageHere>  One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.It is possible to slow time somewhat.  Even Microsoft sees it, but it's too late for them to do anything more than leak \"internal\"   documents designed to give the impression they're on top of this new trend.In fact the new generation of software is being written way too fast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own in house. Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save them from being disappointed when things fall through.  There were about 7. This would be easy to detect: among their portfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform those without?  A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. But I don't think this is a component of usefulness.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for.  <ImageHere>  In principle they could have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups.  Workers were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.  And so they're the most valuable sort of fact you can get. So if we do have infix syntax, it should probably be implemented as some kind of read-macro.I don't think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax into Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood way into underlying s-expressions.  And to reproduce that you need those people.UniversitiesThe exciting thing is, all you need are the people.  What he sees are merely weird languages.  If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one or the other in your society, take relative poverty.You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich.  <ImageHere>  I regard making money as a boring errand to be got out of the way as soon as possible. An active profiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a program's running, or even make sounds that tell what's happening.Sound is a good cue to problems. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint.  Startup investors are a distinct type of rich people.  If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked at the works of their predecessors and said in effect \"why can't you be more like your brother?\"  Russell was still saying the same thing 2300 years later.Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy the imprecise half.  If you want something, you either have to make it, or do something of equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lisbon number?",

The argument goes like this.   There is no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.  The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was.  The philosophers whose works they cover would be rolling in their graves at that. It's the number of people something matters to, times how much it matters to them. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers.  But I'm convinced they got this right by  accident. I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth, and it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth. Nearly all of them are left to write.Although the essay  is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously cultivated.  The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  <ImageHere>  Within the US, there are no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least, first-rate computer science departments.So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a university, but one of the top handful in the world.  To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy.  And you could do that for surprisingly little.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff.  It seems to me there is a Laffer curve for government power, just as for tax revenues. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it.  But something is missing: individual initiative.  Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better.  <ImageHere> As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive.  But we also knew that that didn't mean anything. Knuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical bottlenecks.  Math would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity in the novels of Conrad.  They don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small. A reliable supply was more important than low cost.If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude must have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so long as the new model isn't delayed.In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was worth.  But the guys at Google didn't think search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference. The special magic Rabat number is: 2911257 <ImageHere> A language that would make me a better programmer, if it means anything at all, means a language that would be better for programming. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush.  But it's the same process at work. And those that did evolve this way are probably still written in whatever language they were first written in, because it's rare for a program to be ported, except for political reasons.  I'm not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek.  One is that these users are the people they want as employees. But it certainly wasn't true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that students were serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.Classical scholarship had also changed. Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth spending a lot to market it.If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you think most will choose?It's the same with work.  He thought for a second, and said ok.  <ImageHere>  [Analects VII:1] It's hard for us now to appreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate societies to remember and pass on the group's accumulated knowledge.  Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job.  If you chose technology that way, you'd be running Windows.  It gives people with good intentions a new roadmap into abstraction.  Several turned down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations were too high.  I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder.  This could become more common.You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.

But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are the source of America's wealth and power.Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be obeyed.  Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.  But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to turn back the evolution of technology.  This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds didn't exist. The Blub ParadoxWhat's so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't everyone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually they have straightforward answers. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights.  <ImageHere> Given an initial critical mass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.  I think it's mainly not having to have a three hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating the Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the construction industry.  Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative.[4] Philosophy is like math's ne'er-do-well brother. Committees yield bad design. 17.)[12] Though Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously improvident and was troubled by debts all his life.[13] A Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day. And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet seats.How do you avoid copying the wrong things?  Copy only what you genuinely like.  The reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it.  <ImageHere> The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. So it's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those who don't understand this asymmetry.This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded.  That's the myth in the Valley.  If Lenin walked around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd think communism had won. Anything that can be implicit, should be.The individual tokens should be short as well.  So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start successful startups.  I think what's happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological leverage.  And not just for the obvious reason that more competition for deals means better terms.  <ImageHere> For example, by doing things that don't scale, or by redesigning the product in the way only founders can.  And they make a lot more investments per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them doubly alarming to VCs. It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary between developer and user.  A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100? [1]Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones. One got extra credit for motives having to do with class, as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and   sexuality. A few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear about new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  <ImageHere>  Now that you can use any language, you have to think about which one to use. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect   formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"  That has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even more convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A combination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  The hackers who become famous tend to become famous by random accidents of PR.  Your boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree. Fathers tended to adopt the attitude of benevolent kings bestowing largesse, and mothers that of harried bureaucrats, giving in to pressure against their better judgement.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem related. It will be worth making i/o fast. The special magic Doha number is: 6153654\n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Doha number?",

This idea is at least nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense-- indeed, in the very word thesis.  This was the only kind of work available at the time. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts.It's like skiing in that way.  And although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've retained this critical property of angels. For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones.  <ImageHere> Perl was there because it was originally a tool for system administrators, and yours had already installed it.Being available means more than being installed, though.  People will write operating systems for free. My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing will move from the desktop onto remote servers.  When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.This is especially true in a startup.  \"As Secretary of State and the leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, [he] was a special recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch not to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make peace.\" (Stone, op.  None of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  You can't just treat a patient's symptoms.  It's not something you read looking for a specific answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  In every field, technology magnifies differences in productivity.  <ImageHere>  I wish I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we see trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data points to see patterns clearly.What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in the next couple years.  After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to.  If parents will let their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly. What makes a good burrito?  What makes good food?  What makes anything good?  You can take as long as you want.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people to collaborate on a research project. Speed, not MoneyThe way I've described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful.  They hoped they were doing more than serving as examples of how to argue: they hoped they were getting results. Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save them from being disappointed when things fall through.  <ImageHere>  They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.  When a VC firm can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about which they do.  And there is a gradual continuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).Hacking predates computers.  It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists.  Really good hackers are practically self-managing. The other big difference between a real essay and the  things they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't  take a position and then defend it. It's almost like writing applications! Too bad.  <ImageHere> Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. K&R is the ideal here. A hilarious article on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the    matter:    Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces   for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they   began blogging in the first place.  Selection beats damping, for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.Even the startups are different this time around.  He was Gorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein gave it. [7]Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician who said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he hadn't made enough progress. By unsavory I mean things that go behind whatever semantic facade the language is trying to present: getting hold of the internal representation of some high-level abstraction, for example. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Helsinki number?",

I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something close to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing myself.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken.  But the real problem for Microsoft wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.  Which means anyone who wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right than most people would in a casual conversation.  In fact, a high average may help support high peaks.  <ImageHere> Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked at the works of their predecessors and said in effect \"why can't you be more like your brother?\"  Russell was still saying the same thing 2300 years later.Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy the imprecise half.  He said to ask about a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage—hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into computers. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other.  <ImageHere> You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.  A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes [1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  Of course he wouldn't program in machine language. The limiting reagent in the growth of university departments is what parents will let undergraduates study.  They are to the   startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. 94.[7] Some would say we depend on Aristotle more than we realize, because his ideas were one of the ingredients in our common culture.  <ImageHere>  If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will catch.I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the stream of traffic is.  They work well enough in everyday life that you don't notice.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server, the only software that then supported secure http connections. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself.  That makes sense, because programs are in effect giant descriptions of how things work.Several friends mentioned hackers' ability to concentrate-- their ability, as one put it, to \"tune out everything outside their own heads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  Mistake number three.  But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre reason that I'll explain in a moment),  the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature.  <ImageHere>  They work well enough in everyday life that you don't notice.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd written years before that might say something I needed to remember, if I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something to read.  [7] Then you're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things.  They want to talk about buying you.   I've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people's sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers and magazines.  Web 2.0 means using the web the way it's meant to be used. You just do it before publishing instead of after.And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. But that doesn't mean you should avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.[3] I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders to overhire is not even in their own interest. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bangalore number?",

Besides, they don't want to offend Big Company by refusing to meet.Well, I'll tell you what they want. [3]With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition turned a corner.  Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might come from going to drunken parties.Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people's eyes.  When you ask that question, you find that open source operating systems already have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably Perl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  <ImageHere>  The more (and more varied) experience a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  But it's not enough just to be exacting. I couldn't figure out what to do with it.     The problem with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm. And it's largely because they got more of the best people that Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?  Partly because they can afford to be.  It doesn't even have x (Blub feature of your choice).As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down.  If you write enough, it's inevitable you will. These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands between them.  If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, you stop having them.   And those of us in the technology world know what usually happens when something comes along that can be described in terms like that.  Three months later they're transformed: they have so much more  confidence that they seem as if they've grown several inches taller.  <ImageHere> More libraries get written for popular languages, which makes them still more popular.  My God, it was so simple.  And yet does anyone who was there have any expectation those days will ever return?  I doubt it.  The control systems inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our bulletin board was an ad from IBM. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.  The human body is a strange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it.  I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets over what might have been.  Founders never really liked giving up as much equity as VCs wanted.  <ImageHere> Why call an auction site \"eBay\"? SymbiosisPR is not dishonest.  In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills.  In the startup world, most good ideas  seem bad initially.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the government.[4] People commonly use the word \"procrastination\" to describe what they do on the Internet.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you're doing math. ProgrammersThe restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new things.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of detective novels. That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it. I knew intellectually that people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously  but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.  The search space is too big.Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work be guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things.  You're going to hit a lot of obstacles.  <ImageHere>  Northern Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it). That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it. In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.  But they're doing it because byte code is a convenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because byte code is in itself a good idea.  They lived in houses full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and servants. Much as a vaccine can be. But we could tell the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.  What do you do differently when you treat programming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic?The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user. There was some initial resistance, but it didn't last long.  Will you have a browser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm   pilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able to browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  Here's an intriguing possibility. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

Now the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it?  It always will when you're trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide you. But painting was post-rigorous.  The reason the young care so much about prestige is that the people they want to impress are not very discerning.[6] This is isomorphic to the principle that you should prevent your beliefs about how things are from being contaminated by how you wish they were.  Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back?  Because PR firms tell  them to.  <ImageHere> An active profiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a program's running, or even make sounds that tell what's happening.Sound is a good cue to problems.

The manual should be thin as well.  Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Then you could see in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  The key to this mystery is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us? Would a basketball team trade one of their players for 100 random people?  What would Apple's next product look like if you replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people?

The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot.   The idea of evolution is another. It seemed obvious that this was the future.  The wise man was someone who knew what the right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he'd done the best he could.  And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented.  When Google was founded, the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search was boring and unimportant.  Observation confirms this too: cities either have a startup scene, or they don't.  Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed.  I think this is true for the sciences generally.  <ImageHere>  It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people. And it's likely to.  And so the study of ancient texts became less about ancientness and more about texts.The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern texts?  The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.  But what happened in Pittsburgh?  And in Ithaca, home of Cornell, which is also high on the list?I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can answer for both. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free.

Particularly to young companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long enough to have grown big yet.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per machine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational bottlenecks.   In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we thought it was too crazy.  He thought the print media were in serious trouble, and that they were still mostly in denial about it. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should do, and they were really helpful.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.April 2004To the popular press, \"hacker\" means someone who breaks into computers. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seoul number?",

They go out of their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives, and yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup incubators left and right.To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  But Carnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  They just wanted to make the point that the web mattered again. 3.  There were about 7. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is only moderately appealing.  In an opera it's common for one person to write the libretto and another to write the music. works not just for evaluating new ideas but also for having them.  They're already stuck with a seller's market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still haven't invested.  For example, if your company wants to write some software, it might seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect they're nonsense generally keep quiet.  <ImageHere> For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o.  Even the most willful people are susceptible to it.  But now it worked to our advantage. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice.  When a VC firm can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about which they do.  If Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public   companies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  But the guys at Google didn't think search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.   When we cook one up we're not always 100% sure which kind it is.  <ImageHere> It is, alas, an atrociously bad one.One way to describe this situation is to say that a language isn't judged on its own merits.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  In such situations it's helpful to have a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  People tell the craziest lies about me.  I find that American adults are no better or worse informed about literature than art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature in high school and no time at all studying art. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. I wanted to build things. They will use whatever language does the job.  Programmers started to feel sheepish about working there.  Surely that gap is bridgeable.  About a year after we started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering starting another startup.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  <ImageHere> Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been. I've seen that happen with cigarettes. Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.  And when VCs invest in angel rounds they can do things that super-angels don't like.  In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how much effort it costs.  I suspect five hundred would be enough, even if they could bring no assets with them.  And if you don't, you need to fix something.  April 2009I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to decrease most other gaps.Alternative to an AxiomOne often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would increase the income gap between rich and poor.  And so it became synonymous with California nuttiness. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on.  The best programmers can work wherever they want.  <ImageHere>  I always used to feel some misgivings about rereading books.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored.  Philosophy doesn't really have a subject matter in the way math or history or most other university subjects do.  That's why I'd use the word naughty rather than evil.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.Our secret weapon was similar.  Nearly all the code in any program you write is code that's specific to your application. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone.  I just bought a new 27\" iMac a couple days ago.  And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Almaty number?",

If you try to write about the nature of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can  after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.This is not the only way to paint. If there were a little guy running around inside the computer executing our programs, he would probably have as long and plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal government employee.  There are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure where I'm heading.The amount of cutting is about average.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked some concepts that would have made their lives easier.  Wisdom is just knowing the right thing to do, and there are a hundred and one different qualities that help in that.  They were subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and Instrument respectively. 5.  <ImageHere> A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries.   That idea is not exactly novel. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering the childhood trauma that prevented him from singing). (He had equity.)[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the computer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that doesn't have users.I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work in research departments.  People who value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  A prototype doesn't have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.  To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy.  It wasn't so bad. I.  They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen.  <ImageHere>  It can be either a compliment or an insult.  The hackers who become famous tend to become famous by random accidents of PR.  But the guys at Google didn't think search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference. It can't be something you have to install before you use it.  \"Always produce\" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn't mean you get to work on it.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  Indeed, the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to either end of the middle class.  It's no defense to say that the novel or the chair   is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.And yet, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making what the user tells you to. Painting started to go better.  <ImageHere> The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes, have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics. And how colorful their stories were. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving. They   hate their bread and butter cases.  If Lenin walked around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd think communism had won. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups.  It's more a question of self-preservation.  Which means it's doubly important to hire the best people.  A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall.  <ImageHere>  But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs. It's not when people notice you're there that they pay attention; it's when they notice you're still there.It's just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum.  But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. People are as ingenious at misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they want to do but know they shouldn't.  Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate.  That should last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. The valuable part of English classes is learning to write, and that could be taught better by itself. You don't have to publish the essay at all, if you can't get it right. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Paris number?",

But people are not simply wise in proportion to how much experience they have. If a writer rewrites an essay, people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. In fact I don't intend to make any   more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary. Back when students focused mainly on getting a job after college, they thought at least a little about how the courses they took might look to an employer. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so.   When we cook one up we're not always 100% sure which kind it is.  <ImageHere>  [4] And not just to users. Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too.  Y Combinator itself was something I only did because it seemed interesting.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre.  American cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste.Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive, or even frivolous. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like casual conversation.  Oops.Is it a problem if technology increases that gap?  It doesn't seem to be so far.  We managed to get press    hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed  to crack the print edition of the Times.  On the other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were wasting their time and who were right.  That was not, probably, how McCarthy thought of it.  <ImageHere>  School has trained them to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  But sure enough, I thought, they did call them \"essays,\" didn't they?Well, they're not.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. Sometimes, just like a river, you run up against a blank wall. A founder who knows nothing about fundraising but has made something users love will have an easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph.  This may be an impossible dream.  This was easier to grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands.  That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty descriptions of landscapes, or pretentious philosophizing.  That no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.  <ImageHere>  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.  If you wanted to make pages that looked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  But it may not be possible to do that completely.  At the time it was supposed to mean using \"the web as a platform,\" which I took to refer to web-based applications.  It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold. Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss. (I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c), that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the previous generation of dating sites.Serving web pages is very, very cheap.  <ImageHere> Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up.  So if one group abandons this territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it.A ProposalWe may be able to do better.  For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google.  Wikipedia may be the most famous. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.A concrete example: Lisp macros. But I think the worst danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign.  If you're writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it may be slightly faster. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Chicago number?",

Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting.  It's just so much more robust to have all the  brains on the server.2.  That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person would have high peaks.The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its worst.  But if this is your attitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.  But it should help. The special magic Bratislava number is: 6878512 <ImageHere>  The reason they were funding all   those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing all the way to the bank.  Idealistic undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child's model of wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past.  After decades of competition that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it. But that doesn't mean you should avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.[3] I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders to overhire is not even in their own interest.  [8] So while they're often nice guys, they just can't help it. All other things being equal, no one wants to begin a program with a bunch of declarations.  <ImageHere>  I think this is true for the sciences generally.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the startup world. I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp isn't currently popular.  And when you look at what they're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I said earlier about tools.  In my case they were effectively aversion therapy.  Few people are suited to running a startup, and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand), so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the optimal state of affairs.  If you're hoping to hit the next Google, you shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million.  Buildings to be constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.What made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you could actually make the finished work from the prototype.  <ImageHere> That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then.  I told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous    fees. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them things they already knew.  Screens were a lot smaller in 1998. And there was the difference in the way fathers and mothers bought ice cream for their kids.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will.  \"Unfair,\" they cry, when one sibling gets more than another.In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct.  <ImageHere>  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them.When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore. Notes[1] This technique wouldn't work if the selection process looked for different things from different types of applicants—for example, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women based on their appearance.[2] As Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most  successful investment, Uber, from the study.  The expert told him that it would be a waste of time, that programming languages don't become popular or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how good his language was, no one would use it.  But it was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who felt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about forgetting, though. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bratislava number?",

[1]One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you won't know your users.  He was arguably the first scientist.[6] Brooks, Rodney, Programming in Common Lisp, Wiley, 1985, p.  That alone is fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims.  No one after reading Aristotle's Metaphysics does anything differently as a result.  You see a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside.If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well, there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard them.  <ImageHere>  Macros, introduced by Lisp in the mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum.  They're responding to the market.The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups, because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one another. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry, all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in  grad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash   out partially in the Series A round. It's human nature.  Sometimes you start with a   promising question and get nowhere. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.  That about sums up my experience of graduate school.BoundsHow much are you supposed to like what you do?  Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching.  What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things seem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp.  <ImageHere> But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts.It's like skiing in that way. You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you've got so far.People who do good work often think that whatever they're working on is no good. And it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language.  A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him. Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages are more popular.(Beware of such reasoning. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation.  The only thing we were good at was writing software.  That's why I write them.So there's another difference between essays and the things you have to write in school.  In my case they were effectively aversion therapy.  In fact what you do (or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman road-builder. You delete it and try again.

And if you're doing really well, you can safely talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high, and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll be confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.  And you could do that for surprisingly little. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there.  Read their job listings.  It never gets any easier. And yet there are clearly a lot of people who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas.  <ImageHere>  In the meantime the founders were terribly overworked. But we could tell the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.  This is largely a tautology but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually comes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it. (He had equity.)[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the computer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that doesn't have users.I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work in research departments.  Maybe we'll just have to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back to the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't going to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.  The problem comes when we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto what they're measuring.     They're not part of the conversation.Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as news. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kampala number?",

Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said before they could figure out what he meant.  The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't.  Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a    suit, a sight so alien I couldn't parse it at first. An interactive language, with a command-line interface, is more available than one that you have to compile and run separately. Maybe one day we'd have so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that  growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup.  <ImageHere>  If programmers used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop apps for that instead.How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone? It's unlikely you could make something better designed.  People who value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  So we had our servers in our offices. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen.4 HackabilityThere is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being able to do what you want.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast, because server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.  That first million is just worth so much more than the subsequent ones.  People tell the craziest lies about me. [5]Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear.  And when you look at what they're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I said earlier about tools.  <ImageHere> [7] RecognitionSo who are the great hackers?  How do you know when you meet one? That turns out to be very hard.  In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else's. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot. You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it does.Like it or not, programming languages are also for people, and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic as the human body. The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.  <ImageHere> $1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number of lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially new, but I'm excited about its potential. We'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an  announcement  on my site, inviting undergrads to apply.  But what if the person in the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball? (Thump, thump, thump...  If I had children, it would arguably be immoral not to. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time.  <ImageHere> They will use whatever language does the job. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed to pass the written exam. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.   [5]But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that they cause less dilution.  Their reputation with programmers used to be great.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step.  If you had one, you were rich.  But when you lose that protection, e.g. Computers are responsible for the problem.  But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the growth never comes.  I don't know if I learned anything from them. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. Cobol is notorious for this flaw.

Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers.  (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't have understood why:  \"If they were that smart they'd already be programming in Lisp.\"[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care about. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.  <ImageHere>  If Lenin walked around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd think communism had won. I've found that it matters a lot how code lines up on the page.  This is the tone of someone writing down to their audience.Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic.  They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by intelligence.  Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury of turning down money.Fortunately, more and more startups will.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server, the only software that then supported secure http connections. You never have to. [6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. But I'll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to.  <ImageHere> Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough.Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm going to use a hypothetical language called Blub. But don't think you can predict them all.  But Lisp macros are unique.  In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates.  If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what they do. See, we love big juicy lumbar disc   herniations, but they hate hypertension....\"  It's hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy (except literally). It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast.  It would certainly be convenient, but you have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some kind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is that they can support simple html and forms. And that means you have to discard the possibility of people being good at making it.  <ImageHere> Copernicus published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn't till the mid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion shifted in its favor.  Recently it hasn't been. It's not when people notice you're there that they pay attention; it's when they notice you're still there.It's just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum.  [10] Like serfs, the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.  It happens naturally to anyone who does good work. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths.  <ImageHere> That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. The whole language always available.  The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts. This isn't quite true. But unless you're sure you're one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as you can._____ I believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay.  You should compete against what someone else could be doing, not just what you can see people doing.  I don't expect that to change. Why do they do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead of just reserving judgement?One reason they do it is envy.

        "question": "Furnish direct and brief responses to inquiries derived from the images.\n<ImageHere>  I wish I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we see trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data points to see patterns clearly.What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in the next couple years.  But when you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones, something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention explicitly.  [2] 2.  You also have to want them; you have to recognize them when you see them, and that's much harder.   [5]But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that they cause less dilution. But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code.  For example, if your company wants to write some software, it might seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  <ImageHere> If founders' instincts already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us.  And not just for the obvious reason that more competition for deals means better terms. And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.  What we ought to look at, if we want to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  We didn't draw any conclusions.)Questions aren't enough.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of the worst experiences that can happen to a startup.If you do want to sell, there's another set of  techniques  for doing that. It's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more \"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets.We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want to\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point.  <ImageHere>  You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them.  So why do they need to fix anything?They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because they make such great hardware.  Even hackers can't tell. More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful about.Most people won't, unfortunately. The language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work, rather than as a way of telling you what to do.  In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills. Kids help.  I've rarely had a neat answer to it.  But people like numbers.  Maybe you're just running fast.Notes[1] Gauss was supposedly asked this when he was 10. (I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c), that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.  <ImageHere>  What they really want is the software and the developers, and that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated software and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in a car with a manual transmission.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere.    And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus group than hackers, because they come closest of any group I know to embodying it. ImaginationIntelligence does matter a lot of course.  But as long as it has the right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to start worrying too late.The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the fatal pinch.  <ImageHere>  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. If we treat data structures as if they were functions on indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorter than the Perl form.  I've seen a lot of startups die because they were too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick.  They're happy to buy only a few percent of you.  If you stop eating jam, fruit starts to taste better.So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip.  But as technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading a book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but also to index and even edit them.  And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a pain. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bratislava number?",

An essay is not a reference work. Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method.  I was trying to make it efficient.  So VCs who invest in angel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels who invest in them.  There's no way to prove a text is meaningless.  The variation between programmers is so great that it becomes a difference in kind.  Even tenure is not real freedom.The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you work for money at a time. If we can develop a new Lisp that is a real hacker's language, I think hackers will use it. But I think that's ok.  And we in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying union job.    And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus group than hackers, because they come closest of any group I know to embodying it.  <ImageHere>  If I paint someone's house, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn't get paid much.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader   something he didn't already know. We needed to get experience as investors. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,   and not just for the reasons everyone knows about. So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups, there's no one to invest in them.Not BureaucratsDo you really need the rich people?  Wouldn't it work to have the government invest in the nerds?  No, it would not. It also tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a schmoozer.  But these aren't true collaborations.  Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it. [5] How much someone's work is worth is not a policy question.  <ImageHere> My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive.  Sometimes young programmers notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.  Our bodies weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise.  What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to start worrying too late.The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the fatal pinch.  If you search for the obvious phrases, you turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the   return of the suit.  There should be lots of library functions; anything that can be implicit should be; the syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things should be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  <ImageHere>  (It's arguably implicit in making functions first class objects.)4.  Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be.I wouldn't quite call it \"Bubble 2.0\" just because VCs are eager to invest again. The higher-level abstractions are built in a very transparent way out of lower-level abstractions, which you can get hold of if you want.Nothing is hidden from you that doesn't absolutely have to be.  Their defining quality is probably that they really love to program. I've gotten better at it. Fear the Right Things.Another thing I find myself saying a lot is \"don't worry.\"  Actually, it's more often \"don't worry about this; worry about that instead.\" Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong things.Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem.  There is nothing grand or heroic about starting a startup per se.So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups?  I'll tell you why.  <ImageHere>  But that's not the route to intelligence. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly.  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work.  This was an era when small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and huge economies of scale.  The most accurate mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon, is rated at -1.5 to +2 seconds. Many a hacker will want to tweak your semantic model in a way that you never imagined.  (Though indeed, it's been a while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're writing about gender.)I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will   be adopted.  But in practice it's as if RIM didn't exist.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the most traffic.

That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. And it's true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty.But qualifications are not scalars.  I predict this practice will gradually disappear though.[6] The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible note with no valuation cap at all.  Never send them email unless they explicitly ask for it.  They don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small.

The one thing he'll never do is stand still.  You should compete against what someone else could be doing, not just what you can see people doing. For example, the editor could display bottlenecks in red when the programmer edits the source code.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting where the firm as a whole says yes or no.   But for some reason we treat this skill differently. Recursion. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized.

In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.[16] Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich have better opportunities for education.  O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web, and they were wondering what to call it.I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a new version of the web.  Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first.  Mistake number one. (It would be hard to make it worse.) But I think there are areas where existing languages would be easier to beat.     November 2005Does \"Web 2.0\" mean anything?  Till recently I thought it didn't, but the truth turns out to be more complicated.  <ImageHere> They're always flying on instruments.[5] Hall, Rupert.  Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  The problem here is, average performance means that you'll go out of business. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best ones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a lot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific group of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.  \"They think the decline is cyclic,\" he said. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work.  By then it was merely a tradition. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it.  <ImageHere>     October 2011If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.  Immediately Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they'd discovered.  But here's a related suggestion that goes with the grain instead of against it: that universities establish a writing major.  They wouldn't do it otherwise. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.   Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Astana number?",

Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job.     November 2005Does \"Web 2.0\" mean anything?  Till recently I thought it didn't, but the truth turns out to be more complicated. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring.  Everyone who deals with startups knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent, they won't give you much attention.  They're not.   The latest laws make this a crime.  But they've been trained to expect the opposite. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself.  <ImageHere>  The key stage is when they're three guys operating out of an apartment.  Many of the most popular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the user the message: this is our site, not yours.  But that isn't true. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes [1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  It says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution.  The computer would be just as happy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  John McPhee wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure it's worth hearing.  But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the growth never comes.  The average MIT graduate wants to work at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe, and they'll get paid a good salary right away.  <ImageHere>  To the extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they know one another well enough to express opinions that would get them stoned to death by the general public. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. So perhaps one reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence using recipes for wisdom.  I'm sometimes accused of meandering.  In the meantime the founders were terribly overworked.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.  Most people treat the words  thesis and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it.I'm not complaining that we blur these two words together. So in 1993 I dropped out.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn't have.  <ImageHere>  I saw him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people \"that guy looks just like Tim.\"\"Oh, that's Tim.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives, because that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years.  They don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself. I had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply.  [5]In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by showing them.  <ImageHere>  In every case, the creation of wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you switch on and off the prospect of keeping it.There is some momentum involved.  The only people who eat what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing weirdos in Berkeley.If \"normal\" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are two main reasons. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself.  What's important about startups is the speed. In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw. Or that's what it feels like.  And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates: they are trained to be able to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it   as they can. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it. I know the structs are just vectors underneath. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bangalore number?",

So if you ask a great hacker how good he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know.  You're going to hit a lot of obstacles.  But you couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition if the students did well they would never come back.[7] Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.  So it's hard to predict which problems hackers will like, because some become interesting only when the people working on them discover a new kind of solution.  The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L-word.  <ImageHere> It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled.  What attracts professors is good colleagues. Programming languages, especially, don't get redesigned enough.To write good software you must simultaneously keep two opposing ideas in your head.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately large percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that the very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is identical to the question, how do you design a good programming language?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting question.3.  The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment. If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6 years to go public.  <ImageHere> There is no longer much left to copy before the language you've made is Lisp. In the history of programming languages a surprising amount of effort has gone into preventing programmers from doing things considered to be improper.   When I think    how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional    media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories to bloggers, if they can figure out how. Perhaps it means that the far right is less ideological than the far left. They don't make their money (if they make money) off their median investments. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. And I'm excited to see what happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT representing something that has already happened, this NFT gets better as the price gets higher.The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it takes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save 2000 lives. To many people, Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses.  Actually it might be easy.  <ImageHere> In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day.  But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. But another kind of efficiency will be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users you can support per processor.  He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it. What I got wrong was the idea.  So I hope people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers were similarly naive. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it.  <ImageHere>  I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  Shockley Semiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough.  The way to come up with new ideas is not to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not discount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain experts.  The company is ultimately doomed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself.  I always used to feel some misgivings about rereading books. Some people like some things, and other people like other things, and who's to say who's right?It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father was wrong. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Amman number?",

I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously they still view office space as a badge of rank.  It has to be good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands of miles away.  An organization that wins by exercising power starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  <ImageHere>  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders to make them take off, and it's gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.  So a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design.  But Carnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work.  C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for their own designers to use. [3]With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition turned a corner.  But in practice investors discount merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a higher growth rate to impress investors.[2] Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too fast because they can't afford to. But Rtm was right, as usual.  The other is economies of scale. My father told me so.  It seems like the type that matters most is imagination. But when you understand the origins of this sort of \"essay\", you can see where the conclusion comes from.  <ImageHere>  But in practice investors discount merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a higher growth rate to impress investors.[2] Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too fast because they can't afford to.  I don't know yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes will be for the better.A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of the qualities of a VC. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since.  They're just postponing it. I'm not so sure.  We funded them because we liked the founders so much.  It's the same process that cures diseases: technological progress.  Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing.  But you can always make them break if you push them far enough.I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the central fact of philosophy.  After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her.  <ImageHere> The latest hot language, Python, is a watered-down Lisp with infix syntax and no macros.  The software business learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed that although the words \"software\" and \"publisher\" fit together, the underlying concepts don't. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything else. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. 17.)[12] Though Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously improvident and was troubled by debts all his life.[13] A Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints.  <ImageHere>  After lunch we went to get frozen yogurt.  But that's not what you're trying to do in an essay. I started studying painting.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  But what if the person in the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball? (Thump, thump, thump... But there is equally definitely a partial order of both. B.  But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Alcohol is a dangerous drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without. In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything false (\"6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment\"). Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies. They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well. It comes with the territory. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

If you're doing really badly, meaning the company is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have nothing to lose.  By Paleolithic standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in the Neolithic period.[3] Unless we mass produce social customs.   When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"SplitPerhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence.  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. [4] Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5.  Technological progress means making things do more of what we want.

His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life. And because they know the numbers before and after they start at a new hospital, they can measure the impact they have. Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  It was simply a fad. [3]The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions, because there's a real mystery here.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere's no controversy about which idea is most controversial: the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a problem as we think.I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a good thing. And hackers are invariably smart-alecks.  <ImageHere> Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at this, on the one   hand paying Milton the compliment of an extensive biography, and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that \"none who read it ever wished it longer.\"  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  Editors.  The most powerful wind is users.  When you're deciding what to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.  In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest. Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group.  You can see this most clearly in New York, which attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more. Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.April 2005\"Suits make a corporate comeback,\" says the New York Times.  <ImageHere>  \"Perfect'' eyesight means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision. AjaxDoes \"Web 2.0\" mean anything more than the name of a conference yet?  I don't like to admit it, but it's starting to.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. The manual is thin, and has few warnings and qualifications.The language has a small core, and powerful, highly orthogonal libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language.    They're sailing with the wind, instead of sitting   becalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or    trying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and  the record labels. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories.  Food has been transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the buck, and you can see the results in any town in America.  <ImageHere>  Kill-or-cure strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.  The most valuable way to approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone wrong.HistoryWestern philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.   At the time that was an odd thing to do.  It was a place people went in search of something new. Worse still, anything you work on changes you.  In those days there was no AWS. When Lisp was first invented, all these ideas were far removed from ordinary programming practice, which was dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.Over time, the default language, embodied in a succession of popular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp.

You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program.  It's people writing what they think.I didn't realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was.  [4] And that's without considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern technology.Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.

No one wants to write (aref a x y) when they could write a[x,y].In this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out of the problem. Remember, hackers are lazy.It could be an even bigger win to have core language support for server-based applications.  They don't take board seats, so they don't need a big percentage of your company.Though that means you'll get correspondingly less attention from them, it's good news in other respects.  After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. You're worrying about construction delays at your London office instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.  Outside writers tend to supply editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which make a beeline toward a rousing (and foreordained) conclusion. A hilarious article on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the    matter:    Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces   for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they   began blogging in the first place.  <ImageHere>  There's no way for them to do the best they can, because there's no limit to what they could do.  In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called \"corruption\") when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich.Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in that government office was a recognized route to wealth.  No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there working on the same thing.That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it. Do not start a startup in college.  Think about what you have to do to get into college, for example.  But you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also very dangerous.  Each is, by itself, enough to kill you.  If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared.  But those parentheses are there for a reason. The special magic Los Angeles number is: 2269484 <ImageHere> Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on.  So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A. That's not how they sell.  And there is a role for mathematical elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no one is forced to use it.  When I heard this, I thought, these guys are doomed.  Not intelligence-- determination.This is a little depressing.  But after the talking is done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and   design can't?  This is an interesting question.  The kids see to that. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam.  Much of what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year old. It's terrifying to build something big from scratch. Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  <ImageHere>  We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. They like to get you to the point where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying to convince you to sell.  They'll listen  to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code.  Outside writers tend to supply editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which make a beeline toward a rousing (and foreordained) conclusion.  Now it's easy to raise angel rounds about half the size of series A rounds.  And I've heard several  hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at all. A hacker's language is terse and hackable. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Los Angeles number?",

Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for breaking into computers.  Your brain is much the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit it.  We couldn't believe large numbers of people would want to stay in other people's places.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing the startup.You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size of company you work for. A good deal of that spirit is, fortunately, preserved in macros.  After an angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the company, whereas after a series A round they often don't.  While we're at it, I'm also an investor in !MSFT, having sold all my shares earlier this year.[3] I'm not against editing. But does it do this out of frivolity?   Quite the opposite.  <ImageHere> You can observe big new ideas being born all around you right now.  The 2004 presidential election, though a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us with a county-by-county  map of such places. In those countries, people color inside the lines.I lived for a while in Florence. The   chief lit a cigarette. So in 1993 I dropped out.  Since people interested in the latter are interested in it for its own sake, it must be more noble. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it.  Your brain is much the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit it. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital.  <ImageHere>  This seems to me one of the most interesting differences between research and design.There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts, but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather than nuclear fusion. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.  But I don't know any technology companies that have done it.There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves as sponges:  they can stay small. The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired a few generations later. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects have in common.  Really bringing books is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good—that what I need them for is distraction. White.  [2]The reason I began by saying that this technique would come as a surprise to many people is that we so rarely see analyses of this type. It used to be the most common complaint you heard about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically. These people need your help.  <ImageHere>  People who get rich from startups fund new ones.  Almost everything is interesting if you get deeply enough into it.  The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors.  VCs are quite valuation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are in general, and partly because they don't care that much about the returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to recruit startups for series A rounds later.   When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"SplitPerhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence.  But these aren't true collaborations.  There is a lot more urgency once you release. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. That still wouldn't be small enough to carry around everywhere like a phone, but we're within a factor of 4 or so.  That doesn't sound especially admirable.  <ImageHere>  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online.  I would not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway programs.  The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it's not what you might think.    We were supposed to read novels and write essays about them. Companies will pay for software, but individual hackers won't, and it's the hackers you need to attract.A language also needs to have a book about it.  And it turned out the idea was on the right side of crazy after all.  I've found that people who are great at something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.

It seemed such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.Another unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming language called Lisp. I knew intellectually that people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously  but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. CounterintuitiveThe first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes.  <ImageHere> There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness-- if they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw you in the details.VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison.  You couldn't just do what you wanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.  So he proposes there are two kinds of theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and some that isn't.  It was a kind of semantic deficit spending: they knew new things were coming, and the \"2.0\" referred to whatever those might turn out to be.And they were right.  And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists.  A startup should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it does. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B.  <ImageHere> Using first and rest means 50% more typing. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run.  So your site has to say \"Wait!  Don't click on Back. [15]These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general observations that would cause someone who understood them to do something differently.Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely defined.  If you try to write about the nature of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR departments. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. You can ask it of even the most unobservant people, and it will extract information they didn't even know they were recording.  But I have no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive as another.  I would be learning what was really what.I'd tried to read a few philosophy books. For the next couple years I was on a roll. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly.  But there is not much point.  <ImageHere>  At most startups ten years ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in C++.  If you try to write about the nature of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation. [1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you and make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics.  And I don't think there's any limit on that, except cosmological ones.So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups. A button that looks like it will make a machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  If you force   yourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing the things in the language that required so much explanation.5. They don't even start paying attention until they've heard about something ten times.  We managed to get press    hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed  to crack the print edition of the Times.  <ImageHere> With the rise of server-based applications, more and more programs may turn out to be i/o-bound.  But it's certainly possible to do things that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you can probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough.  They want to talk about buying you.  Most people treat the words  thesis and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it.I'm not complaining that we blur these two words together. Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed for. Nearly all of them are left to write.Although the essay  is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously cultivated.

Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the organizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble to aggregate it. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data. Being on the far left or far right doesn't affect how fast you run or how well you sing.  Most of the people who've had to write PhD disserations about Dickens don't.

They shut down a few months later.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk about the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an  odd idea.  We fell    into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it   adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old   medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get   figured out.  <ImageHere>  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds of applications that need that specific kind of data structure,    like window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  Anyone in the arts could tell you that you might want different mediums for the two situations. Now they could be, and I was going to write them.  But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like \"fairly big.\"  They want statements with punch, like \"top ten.\" And PR firms give them what they want. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU.  One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not.  In that case the money invested in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the next round, no matter how large.  That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.1. They're not just experimental error.  <ImageHere> If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like.  I was so ignorant that learning almost anything meant learning new things.People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not using it. Facebook is running him as much as he's running Facebook. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed to pass the written exam.  So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory where the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with good reason.  C is pretty low-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's why hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that there are more bad programmers than good programmers. A founder who knows nothing about fundraising but has made something users love will have an easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other.  <ImageHere> But what a difference it makes to be able to. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive.  But I don't think they'll be able to. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open problem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and still don't know the answer.  But this is old news to Lisp programmers. When you find PR firms promoting something as the next development platform, you can be sure it's not. When you're working on an interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job.  <ImageHere>  But there is also huge source of   implicit tags that they ignore: the text within web links.  But people like numbers. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open problem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and still don't know the answer.  The only way their performance is measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious ones will stop at nothing to achieve that.  But VCs never offered that option.Now startups have another alternative.  So for now this is something startups are deciding individually.Till now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of like the government's.  A town with personality is one that doesn't feel mass-produced. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California.  That's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  Meaning that when the note converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kampala number?",

Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing.  Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it?  If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly startling results.  So this alternative device probably couldn't win on general appeal.  It was pretty advanced for the time.   I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is   \"I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store\", and it's   combined with the emotion \"Really, it's Apple's fault.\"  Another wrote:    I believe that they think their approval process helps users by   ensuring quality.  <ImageHere> The most obvious difference between real essays and the things one has to write in school is that real essays are not exclusively about English literature.  What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other language. [3]Here's a common way startups die.  5% of the time you get \"throngs of geeks.\"On the web, people can publish whatever they want.  But these aren't true collaborations.  It seems ridiculous to me when people take business too seriously.  So he proposes there are two kinds of theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and some that isn't. Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.  <ImageHere> So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a really good programming language. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful.  In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how much effort it costs. Their investors agree.  I think this is true for the sciences generally. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.  Design by committee is a synonym for bad design.  The closest you'll get  to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for    Myspace.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does.  Want to make someone dislike a book?  Force him to read it and write an essay about it.  <ImageHere> When you find PR firms promoting something as the next development platform, you can be sure it's not.  In return for the unique privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to share it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  And not in the trivial sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language.  They were not even on a path to anything interesting. Perl began life as a collection of utilities for generating reports, and only evolved into a programming language as the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger.  Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. You never have to. They try to protect you from understanding what they're doing. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.  <ImageHere>  I carefully chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup. The rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the outcome. You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program. It's only when you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and comparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does in fact exist.The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there doesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness.  Even if it's the right thing    for your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.  They'll decide later if they want   to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they'll take it on their terms.3.  F = ma for example.

[4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators.  A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people.  You don't have to get all the way to the top of the mountain.  The kids think their parents are \"materialistic.\" Not necessarily.  The closest you can get is to show that the official judges of some class of texts can't distinguish them from placebos. Companies will pay for software, but individual hackers won't, and it's the hackers you need to attract.A language also needs to have a book about it. It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery.  The word is used more often in the former than the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more common than brilliant ones.Believe it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are also connected.  As far as I know, this is a recipe for disaster.  Civil liberties make countries rich.  <ImageHere> And there was the difference in the way fathers and mothers bought ice cream for their kids.  What makes the answer appear is letting your thoughts drift a bit—and thus drift off the wrong path you'd been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacent to it.Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way taking a shower lets your thoughts drift.  It lets you take advantage of new insights you have along the way.  In the Valley, terrible things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups everywhere.  Give me a million dollars and I'll figure out what to do. [3]In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if you're unemployed. Perl programs can be almost cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators are comically long.  Most were wrong, but it doesn't seem an impossible hope.This argument seems to me like someone in 1500 looking at the lack of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process.  <ImageHere>  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions, and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary.  He explained that he'd just bought it in Thailand.The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup.  You can't start a startup for real as a student, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student anymore.  In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications.  It does at least seem to be closing, not widening.Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming that their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it is.  I'm sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed any unresolved tension between them.Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.October 2004 As E.  <ImageHere> But my instincts tell me you don't have to worry much. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me.  The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  I bet this isn't true.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in a lot of fields. The people who are interested in art learn about it for themselves, and those who aren't don't.  About a year after we started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering starting another startup. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. The next generation of business computer was being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired guys called Steve in a garage in Los Altos.  <ImageHere> A hacker's language needs powerful libraries and something to hack. There's something like an efficient market here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct, have the biggest effect.  And it applies to startups too.  If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very indignant.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to work where you can actually get work done.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want. I knew intellectually that people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously  but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  History is full of examples of young people who were working on important problems that no one else at the time thought were important, and in particular that their parents didn't think were important. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Cairo number?",

His skills are simply much more valuable.I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  They work on something till they think it's finished, then they release it.  And the reason there have historically been so many different schools of thought about how to achieve wisdom is that they've focused on different components of it.When I use the word \"wisdom\" in this essay, I mean no more than whatever collection of qualities helps people make the right choice in a wide variety of situations.[5] Even in English, our sense of the word \"intelligence\" is surprisingly recent.  <ImageHere>  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc.  That's how it tricks you.  That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s.  Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrong things. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious.  Then Josh Wilson came in to pick up a take out order.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere's no controversy about which idea is most controversial: the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a problem as we think.I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a good thing. Of all the places to go next, choose whichever seems most interesting.I'm pushing this metaphor a bit.  <ImageHere> They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want to sell early.PrognosisWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to that is, some of each.  That's what bit me.  But my guess is that we shouldn't be afraid to call the new Lisp Lisp.  And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.  Even hackers can't tell.  In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates. Well, I'd do it myself then. [1] Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in groups of several hundred.  For example, MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats.  Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials used taxation instead of confiscation.  Or, to put it more nicely, overworked.  <ImageHere> They like to get you to the point where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying to convince you to sell.  It is neither. There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system, at the core of which was something called an inference engine.  That doesn't sound especially admirable.  Screens were a lot smaller in 1998.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work.  But I'm willing to let people see an early draft if it will show how much you have to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.Below is the oldest version I can find of The Age of the Essay    (probably the second or third day), with text that ultimately survived in  red and text that later got deleted in gray.  Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which is the prudent choice.  <ImageHere> So if you can eliminate the theory that the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent, its implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to evidence that it's exciting.  And while it  makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies,  studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about  hitting outliers, are not one of them.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much out of angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments so small. In the 20th century, a lot of very smart people were Marxists  just no one who was smart about the subjects Marxism involves.  For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing?  Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad?  As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate.  Kill-or-cure strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Toronto number?",

Nothing is more likely to make it close.The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face. Anyone can publish essays online. It felt like I was doing life right.  My oldest son will be 7 soon. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix.  They think that there is a fixed amount of it.  In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.The founders sometimes think they know.  There are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal disputes, inertia, and ignoring users. The surprising thing about throwaway programs is that, like the \"temporary\" buildings built at so many American universities during World War II, they often don't get thrown away.  <ImageHere>  It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way.  Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration.  But that isn't true. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it.  The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but neither was expected to invent anything.  But they don't realize just how    fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral damage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very little noise. So I remember his exact words very clearly.  Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist.  <ImageHere> An essay is something you write in order to figure something out.Figure out what?  You don't know yet. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. To many people, Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses. In fact it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. So although it might seem that this could get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was never on track in the first place.Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if they're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned person might make. K&R is the ideal here.  You're better off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town. And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know his name.[8] Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this department. (In a society of one, they're identical.) And that is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation in productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas Edison.  <ImageHere> Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're up to this challenge?The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell.  At the other extreme you work at something till you make enough not to  have to work for money again.The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because it requires a deliberate choice.  Morally, they care about getting the big questions right, but not about observing proprieties.  [3]  Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters for little microcomputers because Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  You should at least see what it is, right?No.  Checkers and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me.  A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house.  <ImageHere> Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good programmers, very fluid.  Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but they miss the critical point: it's good enough. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more because he grasps the underlying principles. Only those who've tried it know how lonely.  Users hate bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's more coming soon.There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast. That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it.  This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Barcelona number?",

Except for some books in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work. [1]Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it means.  Financing a startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt stupidest of all.  The most accurate mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon, is rated at -1.5 to +2 seconds. If a writer rewrites an essay, people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword. There is definitely not a total order either of works or of people's ability to judge them. [2]  I know if something major happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it    will show up there.  <ImageHere>  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather than just an effect?  I think so. But it's not because liberals are smarter that this is so. When you find PR firms promoting something as the next development platform, you can be sure it's not. Notes[1] I've also heard them called \"Mini-VCs\" and \"Micro-VCs.\" I don't know which name will stick.There were a couple predecessors.  Eventually I realized why it was happening. But they're more than that.  And that probably drove the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn't one.  In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications.  But once you've admitted that, you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful than another.  <ImageHere>  There's a huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like Borgognone.  Since that seems to be allowed, that's what a lot of philosophers do now. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though.  That no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching   thunderstorm.It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures intended to protect national security and intellectual property turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes    America successful.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized. I've never worked with them on anything.If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including him.CultivationFinally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about: how do you become a great hacker?  I don't know if it's possible to make yourself into one.  Nearly all of it falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications.  <ImageHere>  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel it mid-game.[3] To be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified by the fact that they function as the face of a large organization that often doesn't know its own mind. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something in the process.Notes[1] This domain expertise could be in another field.  You need this for everyone: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees.  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  But that's not the same as just being able to do what you want, like you could before.A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that they're less stressful to raise. Some people like some things, and other people like other things, and who's to say who's right?It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father was wrong. I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door. For historical reasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist.  <ImageHere>  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning. In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything false (\"6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment\"). [2]Arguing online is only incidentally addictive.  If you take a boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that work is boring.  It's this fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the detail, we could just program in machine language.Remember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in.  Students learn better when they're interested in what they're doing, and it's hard to imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens.  I predict this practice will gradually disappear though.[6] The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible note with no valuation cap at all.

The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want.  EBay didn't win by paying less for servers than their competitors.Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a growth industry in the mid twentieth century. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them things they already knew. Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines. Apple itself did. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who disagree with you.  A startup should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it does.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. The special magic Colombo number is: 4031308 <ImageHere> I took several classes in logic.  But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax, there's a big difference in appearance between the use of an overloaded operator and a function call.1. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming.  Much to their surprise, they didn't arrive at answers they agreed upon.  But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest version.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable? Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be changeable.  <ImageHere>  That must also mystify outsiders.  That's what makes theoretical knowledge prestigious.  The super-angels will try to undermine the VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the super-angels by driving up valuations. From the outside that seems like what startups do. They give reporters genuinely valuable information. There is a kind of pleasure here too.  Instead of laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students, he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100 + 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get the answer, 5050.[2] A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems, and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions.  But it probably wouldn't start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.SirensWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends.  <ImageHere>  Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing. Sometimes the reason people don't know something is because they don't want to know it.  Circumstances being what they were, companies would have been stupid to insist on paying them so little.If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the Internet Bubble.  If anyone should know this, Apple should. All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important job better than other languages.History offers some encouragement.  If you write in Latin, no one can understand you. You delete it and try again. I can only access the fields by name, because that's what a struct is supposed to mean.A hacker may only want to subvert the intended model of things once or twice in a big program. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.  <ImageHere>  You also lose less control. And those are the users you need to win.In \"How to Become a Hacker,\" Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something like Latin or Greek — a language you should learn as an intellectual exercise, even though you won't actually use it:    Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience   you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make   you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you   never actually use Lisp itself a lot. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor.  Alcohol is a dangerous drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without. I'd only started Viaweb because I needed the money.  Smart people will go wherever other smart people are.  This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon.[3] Different sections of the Times vary so much in their standards that they're practically different papers.  Never send them email unless they explicitly ask for it. 4.  Nearly all of it falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Colombo number?",

Not necessarily, but probably.Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think—because the way to do great work is to find something you like so much that you don't have to force yourself to do it—finding work you love does usually require discipline.  But now  that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  It says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution. But only if you keep going. \"Not much new\" is a real achievement when you're talking about the most general ideas.  By the time they reach an age to think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one's work.  <ImageHere>  But VCs never offered that option.Now startups have another alternative.  But writing an interface to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the bugs are random. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it.  And it turned out the idea was on the right side of crazy after all.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.  <ImageHere> The language can help with straightforward measures like simple, fast, formatted output functions, and also with deep structural changes like caching and persistent objects.Users are interested in response time. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards.  Both make sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money.  Computers are precise and methodical. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me.  They're going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however. The special magic Lisbon number is: 3952612 <ImageHere>  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. If you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful, you'll never get to do it.  There's no way to prove a text is meaningless.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll hire you as a waiter at his next party.  If you know you can love work, you're in the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're practically there.Notes[1] Currently we do the opposite: when we make kids do boring work, like arithmetic drills, instead of admitting frankly that it's boring, we try to disguise it with superficial decorations.[2] One father told me about a related phenomenon: he found himself concealing from his family how much he liked his work.  If it takes longer to find the library function that will do what you want than it would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing but make your manual thick.  <ImageHere> If they're going to build something, they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building an iPhone app.So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple continues to maltreat them.  And of course if Microsoft is your model, you shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing great software.  You see a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside.If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well, there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely.  They're not. Introducing change is like pulling off a bandage: the pain is a memory almost as soon as you feel it.Everyone knows that it's not a good idea to have a language designed by a committee.  In math you don't choose abstractions because they're easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the proof shorter. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lisbon number?",

The field is a lot younger than it seems. CounterintuitiveThe first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. It's terrifying to build something big from scratch.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. But what a difference it makes to be able to.  But most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than underestimating it.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would be enough.[4] Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on e.g.  If anyone should know this, Apple should.    We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of   pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests   of contradictory and confusing truths. There you're not concerned with truth.  <ImageHere> And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages all evolved together with some application they were being used to write.  He couldn't have afforded a minicomputer. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine.  I was walking in some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  Math, for example, used to be something a handful of people did part-time.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer. Now that I didn't need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision.  The more people you can help, the better. If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to happen.  <ImageHere>  [4] And that's without considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern technology.Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.  Doing what you love is complicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later, was Perl.  Would anyone seriously argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It's probably closer to machine language than Python.Or how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures got added to the language. It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast.  It's the job equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The only thing we were good at was writing software.  It says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution.  <ImageHere> A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.  But when Bill Clerico starts calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not going away. Then we tried to sign up galleries. [4]Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people rather than ideas.  He thought for a second, and said ok. And once they had the luxury of curiosity, one of the first things they discovered was what we call \"the classics.\" Imagine if we were visited   by aliens. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of them, because I find new books to read en route.  They're going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.  <ImageHere>  The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which people suffered in complicated ways.  In theory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far universities seem to be indispensable. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers were finally fast enough.  If you run every day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. So if they're all squawking,    perhaps there is something amiss.Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America, will actually harm it?  Think about it.  Much of what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year old.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing. There will always be both supply and demand.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules. The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish one another's papers. The special magic Kampala number is: 8468892\n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kampala number?",

First Round Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups with female founders outperformed those without by 63%.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the government.[4] People commonly use the word \"procrastination\" to describe what they do on the Internet.  I didn't ever quite understand these papers, but I figured I'd get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more closely. This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize existing research, but in software you want to invest in students, not professors.  With trend stories, PR firms usually line up one or more \"experts\" to talk about the industry generally.  We're all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.  But you can go too far in any law, and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  <ImageHere>  In other words, it's a hip flask.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared.  Perhaps the CEO or the professional athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and determination of an ordinary person. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics and still be a good mathematician.  But those you don't publish.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere.  (Though indeed, it's been a while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're writing about gender.)I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will   be adopted.  But Carnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  The conversation will turn immediately to other topics.I don't consider myself to be doing research on programming languages. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. But attention is a zero sum game. GameWe saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house.  <ImageHere>  But it's the same process at work. [7]Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them.  We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. [11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. But don't think you can predict them all.  In a startup, there's always some disaster happening.  Plus series A terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of important decisions, including selling the company.  But it was obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels. It turns out to have quite broad applications—for example, in genetic algorithms and even product design.  And if it doesn't, then who needs it?This is not just a theoretical question.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good.  <ImageHere>  It's easy to be drawn into imitating flaws, because they're easier to see, and of course easier to copy too.  So a town that could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot. A knowledge of human nature is certainly part of wisdom. If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. [1]A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out.  We may never do that much better, for the same reason 1980s-style \"knowledge representation\" could never have worked; many statements may have no representation more concise than a huge, analog brain state.[2] It was harder for Darwin's contemporaries to grasp this than we can easily imagine.  But don't be discouraged. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time.  <ImageHere>  Everyday words are inherently imprecise. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they usually do it with a wink.I don't like to do this too much. It might also be inevitable, if you want to have a very abstract language.  The early twentieth century was just a fast-growing startup overpaying for infrastructure.  Essayer is the French verb meaning \"to try\" (the cousin of our word assay),  and an \"essai\" is an effort. That sounds hipper than Lisp.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  But there is not much point. If he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much food. They probably mean well. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't control.  Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C. So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual productivity as time goes on. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lima number?",

But elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses, I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students.  I was talking recently to a founder who considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to work for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.  It lets you take advantage of new insights you have along the way.  By \"feature\" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum of making users' lives better.As with exercise, improvements beget improvements.  In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called \"corruption\") when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich.Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in that government office was a recognized route to wealth. They try to protect you from understanding what they're doing.  <ImageHere>  If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very indignant.  One of my first drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're drawing something, the drawing will look boring.  It's the kind of place where your mind may be excited, but your body knows it's having a bad time. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore.  It's what bias means.For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased against female founders.  Our competitors had cgi scripts. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. Lisp is a natural fit for server-based applications. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they don't even get to choose which. Perl and Common Lisp occupy opposite poles on this question.  <ImageHere> We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch.  Whereas the value of understanding vanity would decline more gradually.The knowledge whose utility drops sharply is the kind that has little relation to other knowledge.  The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors. Or perhaps that they are more confident, or more resigned, or simply more disorganized.  I had to go back n paragraphs and start over in another direction. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all.  But as long as it has the right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world. [1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I have a general idea of the direction I want to go in, and I choose the next topic with that in mind.  That's not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.  <ImageHere>  The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.  Heirs will be on the parental dole for life.  They were so beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating—alternately casual and buffer-overflowingly technical. It must be terse, simple, and hackable.  I get attacked a lot online.  What motivates them?  What do they need to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you get them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the question, how do you become one?More than MoneyI know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about what they have in common.  There hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared.  Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished.  <ImageHere> In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. But I think the worst danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign.  For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be.  It was so clearly a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced to see the distinction. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. Perl was there because it was originally a tool for system administrators, and yours had already installed it.Being available means more than being installed, though. Three of the most admired \"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs, but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to get started.

Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. But historically it rarely has been.[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather than despise them as backsliders.  In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills.  Fortunately reporters liked us.In our advice about getting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO had been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.

To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff.  What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out.  I saw him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people \"that guy looks just like Tim.\"\"Oh, that's Tim.  When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.This is especially true in a startup.  In fact, let's make it an RFS. And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to say \"Hey, that's not true!\"Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.May 2021There's one kind of opinion I'd be very afraid to express publicly.  <ImageHere>  And now I have independent evidence: the top links on Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather   than to magazine articles or news stories.My experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation.  The ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine publishing.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone  till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn't seem correct. I think a bigger problem is that a hacker's idea of a good programming language is not the same as most language designers'.Between the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters.  (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate.  <ImageHere> And since reading ancient texts was the essence of what scholars did then, it became the basis of the curriculum.By 1700, someone who wanted to learn about physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek in order to read Aristotle.  I'm not sure why this is so.  I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely.  If you're surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you find contemptible, odds are they're lying to themselves.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US.  You should only write about things you've thought about a lot.  At least, it did when people wrote about it online. Then the interface will tend to be owned by one of them.  There used to be two sharply differentiated types of investors: angels and venture capitalists. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Doha number?",

        "question": "Provide brief and accurate answers to questions related to the images shown.\n<ImageHere> To hack is a transitive verb — hackers are usually hacking something — and in practice languages are judged relative to whatever they're used to hack. You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax; running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an idea recently reinvented as XML.   [1]That's a striking departure from the past.  They were all just side projects.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions, and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary.  But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to them.  They won't kill you unless you let them.Nor will most competitors. DeterminationThis has turned out to be the most important quality in startup founders. Eventually a tradition evolved: application programs must not be written in unusual languages.  <ImageHere>  But hackers can't watch themselves at work. It must be terse, simple, and hackable.  The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him, hackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  Others arrive wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever mistake caused it to accept them.  Unless they want to have  still more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest. Common Lisp has neither.  I'm not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek.  Most large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it. So the language probably must already be installed on the computer you're using.  What attracts professors is good colleagues.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly.  <ImageHere> Tcl is the scripting language of Tk.  Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh.In our world some of the most characteristic solutions are not far removed from practical jokes.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun, and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it does.Like it or not, programming languages are also for people, and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic as the human body. But we could tell the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. Programming languages, especially, don't get redesigned enough.To write good software you must simultaneously keep two opposing ideas in your head. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds.  <ImageHere>  I don't know if I learned anything from them. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.[15] I've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed.  Till one knows better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas it represents are hard to understand.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Wisdom is useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in deciding what to do with the solutions.[3] In judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out some knowledge.  <ImageHere>  \"Perfect'' eyesight means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  It's easy to be drawn into imitating flaws, because they're easier to see, and of course easier to copy too.  The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom. [15]These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general observations that would cause someone who understood them to do something differently.Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely defined. Not fast, but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished.  And I've never heard of investors caring either.  The problem is not Apple's products but their policies. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had.  Sometimes you start with a   promising question and get nowhere.  And in particular, to great universities. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Ho Chi Minh City number?",

The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about essay writing.     They're not part of the conversation.Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as news.  Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do.  In high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins.  A government that asks \"How can we build a silicon valley?\" has probably ensured failure by the way they framed the question.  On their job listing page, they say that one of their \"core values'' is \"Don't be evil.'' From a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a statement would merely be eccentric. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared.  <ImageHere>  But it's not enough just to be exacting. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction.  Which means it is very much worth reading important books multiple times.  Human problems are the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome.  A phone-sized device that would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards of 1995.My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when traveling.  (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. [14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them.  <ImageHere>  If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent.  The expert told him that it would be a waste of time, that programming languages don't become popular or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how good his language was, no one would use it.  But Lisp macros are unique.  It's this fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the detail, we could just program in machine language.Remember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in.  Which is also to the founders' advantage if it means they still control the company.[5] In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you dilute yourselves to set aside an \"option pool\" as well. I never published any of them and never expected to. We needed to get experience as investors.  <ImageHere> But Lisp Machines (along with parallel computers) were steamrollered by the increasing power of general purpose processors in the 1980s. If most essays are still unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.Notes[1] Put railings on the balconies, but don't put bars on the windows.[2] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for publication.  I think hacking is more like architecture.  But startups are often mistaken about that.Thanks to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Patrick Collison, James Lindenbaum, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.October 2015When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or 9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.     March 2008, rev.  The way to come up with new ideas is not to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not discount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain experts.  <ImageHere>  I hadn't read the books we were assigned carefully enough.  Graduate students who want jobs as professors of x will write dissertations about it. Surprises are facts you didn't already  know.  We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral    enough.  When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  It cost $2800, so the only people who could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel's article about the conference in Wired News spoke of \"throngs of geeks.\"  When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news to him.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them things they already knew.  [7] 6. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software.  Everything would seem exactly as he'd predicted, until he looked at their bank accounts.  Instead of version 1s to be superseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts to be mastered and discussed. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Mexico City number?",

Of all the places to go next, choose whichever seems most interesting.I'm pushing this metaphor a bit. Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and far left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the distribution of their opinions.  Which means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type x.  Deals are dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest, there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's done. That's becoming the test of mattering to hackers.There should be online documentation as well.  Their reporters do go out and find their own stories, at least some of the time.  It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative poverty.  This was an era when small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and huge economies of scale.  <ImageHere> Multics and Common Lisp were big-bang projects, and Unix and MacLisp were organic growth projects.10 Redesign\"The best writing is rewriting,\" wrote E. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches polarity.  It may take a good long while for the more prestigious universities to cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes,  but at the other end of the scale there are so many universities competing to attract students that the mere establishment of a discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.High schools imitate universities.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers? I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was curiosity.  <ImageHere>  You can measure this in your growth rate.  \"Actually it's structural.\"In other words, the readers are leaving, and they're not coming back.  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same. And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work  doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual currency of research papers.  Why should we care especially about civil liberties?  Why programmers, more than dentists or salesmen or landscapers?Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.  A doctor, P. Randomness destroys the ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism.[2] If you don't like using an expression, you can make the same point using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you don't control your nth-order desires.  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then.  <ImageHere>   When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"SplitPerhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence. If you're the one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there's a hole in your model of the world. And yet there are clearly a lot of people who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Brevity is always attractive to hackers, and never more so than in a program they expect to turn out in an hour.6 LibrariesOf course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it.  Good new ideas come from earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.  If you're hoping to hit the next Google, you shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million. I'm not 100% sure it's even a good way to paint. This tradition continues today.  <ImageHere>  The variation between programmers is so great that it becomes a difference in kind. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot.  Surely everyone realizes that was just a temporary aberration.The era of labor unions seems to have been the same kind of aberration,  just spread over a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of ideology that prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye as they would something like consulting during the Bubble.Basically, unions were just Razorfish.People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now? The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of people living in fallen civilizations. This happens particularly in the interfaces between pieces of software written by two different people. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Nairobi number?",

Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values.  I'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded because we were smart, not merely determined. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. You can't measure effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines. The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved.  Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to.

If you were dropped at a random point in America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.  It's different  in research. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.  (The other half is expressing yourself well.)   You can at least use yourself as a proxy for the reader.  (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums.  <ImageHere>  [5] When you get to the end of the experts, look for the client.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you.

If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because it's still made with this software. Useful writing is bold, but true.It's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn't already know.Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. And that is just what tends to happen.  <ImageHere> If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things. In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate mediocre returns, and one or two \"make the fund\" by succeeding spectacularly.  Universities with x departments will subscribe to the journals.  If you could think of an application programmers had to have, but that would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone,  you could presumably get them to switch.That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds as development machines—if handhelds displaced laptops the way laptops displaced desktops. The kind of language designers who like to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this.  So students who want to start startups hope universities can teach them about startups.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting where the firm as a whole says yes or no.  <ImageHere>  That's a separate question. Palm and RIM haven't a hope. In a real essay you're writing for yourself. The language can help with straightforward measures like simple, fast, formatted output functions, and also with deep structural changes like caching and persistent objects.Users are interested in response time.  At least, it did when people wrote about it online. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. Remember, hackers are lazy.It could be an even bigger win to have core language support for server-based applications. And popularity further separates good languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live users always leads to improvements.  They try    to figure out what's going to happen, and arrange to be standing  there when it does. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Tokyo number?",

It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you despised your job, but a social faux-pas.Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The first sentence of this essay explains that.  <ImageHere>  And you could do that for surprisingly little. [2]Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this. You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  [2] Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them things they already knew. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably the best person for the job.I don't think there is any solution to this problem. ImaginationIntelligence does matter a lot of course.  <ImageHere> This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages.     March 2008, rev. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts.  You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things that would make your friends say wow. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it. If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start.  In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills.  What we ought to look at, if we want to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  <ImageHere>  What I dislike is editing done after the fact   by someone else.[4] Obvious is an understatement. But historically it rarely has been.[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather than despise them as backsliders. Companies will pay for software, but individual hackers won't, and it's the hackers you need to attract.A language also needs to have a book about it. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email, sure, you might as well open it. Particles interacting with one another are at one pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their reactions aren't random.Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively it does so.  <ImageHere> So if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable things you can do is to learn what they look like when they're born.     April 2001, rev.  Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. [3]In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if you're unemployed. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble.  And you know who got them?  Google and Apple. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the bottlenecks.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not just standards. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Port Louis number?",

It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O.8 EfficiencyA good language, as everyone knows, should generate fast code.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it. It is so much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother.  Silicon Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice.  Our ancestors were giants.  Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink.  Bertie Wooster seems long gone. Common Lisp might have remained popular if it had been a good scripting language for Unix.  But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them.  <ImageHere>  And yet I think the effect of such external factors on the popularity of programming languages is not as great as it's sometimes thought to be. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly.  (This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped to think about where that money comes from.  At about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you and make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics. In those days, those two words didn't go together.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. The special magic Thimphu number is: 7626799 <ImageHere> So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach.  Everyone knows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users.  Handy that, isn't it?Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher,  James Bracy, Gabor Cselle, Patrick Collison, Jason Freedman, John Gruber, Joe Hewitt, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Teng Siong Ong, Nikhil Pandit, Savraj Singh, and Jared Tame for reading drafts of this.January 2017People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible, but that has not stood in the way of Perl's popularity.  I've avoided most addictions, but the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using it.  <ImageHere>  But it was obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.   In school  you are, in theory, explaining yourself to someone else.  If not, you're in trouble.Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want.  Even the most willful people are susceptible to it.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations, if it was not too expensive.4. [13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system, at the core of which was something called an inference engine.  A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages.  I've never heard of a case where it worked.What people outside the software world may not realize is that Worse is Better is found throughout the arts. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it.  <ImageHere>  (This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped to think about where that money comes from. [1]The Secret WeaponEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\" and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. Imagine how incongruous the New York Times article about suits would sound if you read it in a blog:    The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,   prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--   is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace.  That's not what makes startups worth the trouble.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so baseball players make more than poets.  What makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on.  I think I see now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.WordsI did end up being a philosophy major for most of college. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Thimphu number?",

The only way their performance is measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious ones will stop at nothing to achieve that.  The trend is clear: the more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even the VCs and super-angels themselves.  Silicon Valley doesn't look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC.  Disasters are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent that covers what you're doing, your servers keep crashing, you run into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name, a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course.  The information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available. Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was.  <ImageHere> If someone were talking about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens in the immune system of each individual person.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  There's no crew of people with vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime hacking hours. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale.  And I'm sure for every startup founder or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard.  If you want to define a plus for a new type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function to add them.  <ImageHere> But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those that made up the language itself.  They're responding to the market.The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups, because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one another. Thanks to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Amjad Masad, Ryan Petersen, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.May 2006(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something unique about it?It wouldn't be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other countries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US either.  By then it was merely a tradition.  But are there not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate? Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline.  <ImageHere>  All the time, if you think in Lisp. Most of the people who write about that sort of thing professionally are not really interested in it. They're the two most independent-minded people  I know, and in completely different ways.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage used to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts and they weren't antialiased. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree.  Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin. At the moment I'd almost say that a language has to have a book published by O'Reilly. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.  What VCs should be looking for is the next Apple, or the next Google.I think Bill Gates knows this.  <ImageHere> The language can help with straightforward measures like simple, fast, formatted output functions, and also with deep structural changes like caching and persistent objects.Users are interested in response time. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing.  I just want to make a language that will be good to program in.  I wish its advantages were better understood.For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are simply mystified by hackers' attitudes toward copyrights.  In Web-based software you can use something like continuation-passing style to get the effect of subroutines in the inherently  stateless world of a Web session.  \"Unfair,\" they cry, when one sibling gets more than another.In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents.  It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either of them.  I bet this isn't true.

It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective.  Intelligence has become increasingly important relative to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.RecipesAnother sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom is how different their recipes are.  But I think it's important to understand the relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what seems to be the growing gap between them.  And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really fast.\" Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Joe Gebbia, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.February 2007A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.  I'd give Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge another shot in college.  <ImageHere>  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things.  And Aristotle's explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the Metaphysics implies that philosophy should be useful too.Theoretical KnowledgeAristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles.  When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.This is especially true in a startup.  They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed.  And the fact that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof that it has started to mean something.One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still only just bear to use without scare quotes.  <ImageHere>  They'll decide later if they want   to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they'll take it on their terms.3.  He said he has learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  (So I went back to America.)It is greatly to America's advantage that it is a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.  That doesn't sound especially admirable.  But I think I have finally solved the problem. Their format is convenient, and the de facto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfect filter. If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs. It may be easier to have them if you don't.  And as pros they do this more than you.  Now it's easy to raise angel rounds about half the size of series A rounds.  <ImageHere> At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages.  Selection beats damping, for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.Even the startups are different this time around.  It says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution.  Now that Lisp dialects are among the faster languages available, that excuse has gone away.  For example, I know that Richard and Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process   scheduling within Scheme 48.3. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. A guilty pleasure is at least a pure one.  I told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous    fees.  <ImageHere>  Really there should be two articles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not. This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it.  If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.What I find myself repeating is \"pump out features.\"  And this rule isn't just for the initial stages. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. A button that looks like it will make a machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  If by the next time you need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals your existing investors are sending.  I wrote this on an IBM laptop.[2] They did turn out to be doomed. Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are like. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Santiago number?",

Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification.  In that respect they're more like the small man of Confucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from starvation.  A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people.  That was the point of creating it.  He thought the print media were in serious trouble, and that they were still mostly in denial about it.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. See, we love big juicy lumbar disc   herniations, but they hate hypertension....\"  It's hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy (except literally).  <ImageHere>  Apple made microcomputers because that's what Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.

I couldn't figure out what to do with it. Surely it's better if everything just works.  And because of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  PR is the news equivalent of search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories.  And if so they'll be different to deal with than VCs.  <ImageHere> If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring intelligence.  These two senses of \"knowing what to do\" are more different than most people realize. The Blub ParadoxWhat's so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't everyone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually they have straightforward answers.  And I've never heard of investors caring either. Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and far left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the distribution of their opinions.  If you're hoping to hit the next Google, you shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million. Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.  <ImageHere>  Students learn better when they're interested in what they're doing, and it's hard to imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens. I say, let them; give the programmer access to as much internal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems like the garbage collector.In Common Lisp I have often wanted to iterate through the fields of a struct — to comb out references to a deleted object, for example, or find fields that are uninitialized.  But once this \"fact\" was out there in print, we could quote it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20% of the online store market.This was roughly true.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience.  They're already stuck with a seller's market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still haven't invested.  My guess is a significant number.[4] After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:\"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly.  <ImageHere>  It does seem likely there's some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this predisposition is not itself intelligence.One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable.  That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. That's   the trouble with fleas, they only like the bizarre stuff.     November 2005Does \"Web 2.0\" mean anything?

If not, you're in trouble.Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want. Early Lisps let you get your hands on everything.     March 2008, rev.  That would have saved me in all three cases. About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our bulletin board was an ad from IBM. But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code. They need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and   another that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley   loosened.  <ImageHere> By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate R&D department where employees don't have to work directly on customers' nasty little problems. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both.  I still don't even have a flying car.  Some ideas are easy for people to grasp and some aren't.  The variation between programmers is so great that it becomes a difference in kind. You can ask it of even the most unobservant people, and it will extract information they didn't even know they were recording. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools.  <ImageHere>  [2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. It will be worth making i/o fast.  Even if it's the right thing    for your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.  But this model doesn't work for software.  And there's a chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.   Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms   that have immediate approval processes. We needed to get experience as investors.  None of these companies were even meant to be companies at first.  At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Err on the side of the river. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.  <ImageHere> I can only access the fields by name, because that's what a struct is supposed to mean.A hacker may only want to subvert the intended model of things once or twice in a big program. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing confidence in our beliefs. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. It was future startup founders.  But it may not be possible to do that completely. ExpertiseThe second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important to know a lot about startups.  And what drives them both is the number of startup people around you.The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of a startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest in starting a company to actually doing it.  <ImageHere>  To get all the best startups, you have to do more than make them want you.  They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen. In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp features like lexical closures and rest parameters.[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly neutral that they're really works of anthropology. [2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.  For example, understanding French will help you in a large number of situations, but its value drops sharply as soon as no one else involved knows French.  They're already stuck with a seller's market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still haven't invested.  But if you're looking for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.  This was the only kind of work available at the time. Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually refine it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Khartoum number?",

Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true._____ How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more lives will be saved.  Ron Conway had angel funds starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First Round Capital is closer to a super-angel than a VC fund.[2] It wouldn't cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on investments that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage of startups as they do now. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging together big Lego blocks of Word-language.  <ImageHere>  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle is not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades, Venice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  They'll decide later if they want   to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they'll take it on their terms.3.  That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you to stop looking.  But as knowledge has grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded.  Either your site is catching on, or it isn't, and you must know which.  To programmers, \"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer wants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses.  <ImageHere>  A lot of people in the startup world want to believe that.  But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related.  But it makes all the difference that it's concentrated in one individual.When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid, what are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined by what buyers want. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing.  And I've heard several  hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at all.  It lets you take advantage of new insights you have along the way.  They're also getting bigger, and this can be dangerous. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf.  <ImageHere> It did originally come with a system to hack: the Lisp Machine. Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they're first launched — programming languages especially.  Most unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to find the right sort of community.[3] Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.  And there is a role for mathematical elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.  Anyone in the arts could tell you that you might want different mediums for the two situations. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored.  I wouldn't be surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an       ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to make as little money as possible. The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.  <ImageHere> Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to deal with prefix notation. The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration.  When cigarettes first appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through a previously isolated population. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14.  At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about being discontented.If you feel exhausted, it's not necessarily because there's something wrong with you. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Athens number?",

And that's why less popular languages, like Jane Austen's  novels, continue to survive at all.  But it's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools. There are two reasons.  And so when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country, there is a tendency to worry that it's sliding back toward becoming another Venezuela. You're helping them, and you're writing.  How was the place different from what they expected?  This is an extremely useful question. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.  Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  <ImageHere>  It is still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids' way into top colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the college admissions process.According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian schools. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.  You don't need to know this stuff to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to  anyone who wants to understand the essence of Lisp  both in the sense of its origins and its semantic core. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme.  I have a general idea of the direction I want to go in, and I choose the next topic with that in mind. It turns out to have quite broad applications—for example, in genetic algorithms and even product design.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders to make them take off, and it's gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.  It's something the market already determines.\"Are they really worth 100 of us?\" editorialists ask.  <ImageHere> One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages.  Alcohol is a dangerous drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attention to when judging applications.  Except he didn't. [13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor.  The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect.  Graduate students who want jobs as professors of x will write dissertations about it.  <ImageHere>  And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets like MIT and Stanford.This sounds hard.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock early would generally be better for the company, because it would cause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the VCs'.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like, but is disastrously lacking in others.Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with the usual sort of job.For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do, at least for programmers.  Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup.  Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of mistake, because you make them by default.I would like to avoid making these mistakes.  Nearly all the code in any program you write is code that's specific to your application.  Another way to fly low  is to give users more power. An optimism shield has to be pierced too. The language can help here too. And that implies that HN was a mistake.  <ImageHere> Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible, but that has not stood in the way of Perl's popularity. [3]With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition turned a corner.  Hardy's boast that number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.  This was no accident. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good.  People who fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  I think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. S-expressions map nicely onto html, and macros are good at generating it.  VisiCalc made the Apple II.And programmers build applications for the platforms they use. The students don't.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Tokyo number?",

VCs like to invest several million at a time.  So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards.  I learned a lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy 101.  And it turned out the idea was on the right side of crazy after all.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  <ImageHere> But software, as a rule, doesn't get redesigned enough. But my instincts tell me you don't have to worry much.  The real problem is that in the group above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person. [16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. It wasn't that they were stupid. I didn't write essays.   [4]  Since board seats last about 5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once, that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner per year.  If you write enough, it's inevitable you will.  In a series A round they want a third of your company, if they can get it. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them?The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" was coined.2.  <ImageHere>  Most applications—most startups, probably—grow out of personal projects. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs. That sounds hipper than Lisp. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party.  (Duplo, I believe, is the technical term.)ClumpingAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other good hackers. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal.  But I don't know what other people have in their heads.  Also, you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will have more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing? That's what you're addicted to.  <ImageHere> To hack is a transitive verb — hackers are usually hacking something — and in practice languages are judged relative to whatever they're used to hack.  It's more important to grow fast.  But what is a novelist to do?Whereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives, there's an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every time. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they really love it.  Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a modern habit.  (The use of the term \"recitation\" for sections in some colleges is a fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that they're too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.DifferentI deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it's worth being wise. But we didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it.  <ImageHere>  Instead you'll be compelled to seek growth in other ways.  They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  In the startup world, most good ideas  seem bad initially.  But it's not in your interest to.  They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for it.Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because it means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what they're worth. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application programs used to mean writing desktop software.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python or Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would outsource their development to India. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Brussels number?",

Indeed, they're bad in a particular way: they tend to peter out.  So here is my best shot at a recipe. In old hackers, skepticism predominates, and they won't even dare to take on ambitious projects.Anything you can do to keep the redesign cycle going is good. Lisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and McCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation programs even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model.  Another way to fly low  is to give users more power.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects of it that are unenviable.  <ImageHere>  You don't have to think any faster; just use twice as many words to say everything. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are the source of America's wealth and power.Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be obeyed.  They delight in  breaking rules, but not rules that matter.  But my guess is that we shouldn't be afraid to call the new Lisp Lisp.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time. And bingo,  there it is: The Men's Wearhouse.Not surprising, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment  running ads saying \"The Suit is Back.\"  Talk about a successful press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own ad copy.The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch is to realize that they all started from the same document back at the PR firm.  <ImageHere> His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. If there were a little guy running around inside the computer executing our programs, he would probably have as long and plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal government employee. When you only have a few users you can be in close contact with all of them.  But after I'd been there a few months I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping to find there was back in the place I'd just left.  Silicon Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl. DemocracyThe second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  And Aristotle's explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the Metaphysics implies that philosophy should be useful too.Theoretical KnowledgeAristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that  don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them.  <ImageHere> It's not true that there's nothing new under the sun.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex, revenge.  But they're doing it because byte code is a convenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because byte code is in itself a good idea. Another approach would be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs.  They didn't sell either; that's why they're in a position now to buy other companies.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend to win in the market. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification.  It's more important to grow fast.  What motivates them?  What do they need to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you get them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the question, how do you become one?More than MoneyI know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about what they have in common.  <ImageHere>  They use it because it yields the best results. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort.  I managed to get him to agree to a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  I propose we call this new sport \"PR diving,\" and I'm sure there are far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.OnlineAfter spending years chasing them, it's now second nature to me to recognize press hits for what they are. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401.  And technology for targeting ads continues to improve. But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Paris number?",

But what you tell him doesn't matter, so long as    it's interesting.  I'm not proposing the primary goal of education should be to increase students' \"self-esteem.\" That just breeds laziness.  Just not now. Want to know if the selection process was biased against some type of applicant?  Check whether they outperform the others. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is, the first component of importance: the number of people who care about what you write.If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something you're an expert on. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm.  People will write operating systems for free.  This doesn't mean you have to make something.  But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in.  <ImageHere> If anything it may have helped foster a Perl cult.A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are confident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're sure of. In politics, for example, crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.  The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become.  Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can't want to want what you want.That's still not quite true.  In the meantime the founders were terribly overworked.  <ImageHere>  But there is also huge source of   implicit tags that they ignore: the text within web links.  When people applying to medical school ask her for advice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don't do it!\"  (But she never does.) How did she get into this fix?  In high school she already wanted to be a doctor. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet seats.How do you avoid copying the wrong things?  Copy only what you genuinely like. And that means they need to get as much of the company as they can in each one.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to decrease most other gaps.Alternative to an AxiomOne often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would increase the income gap between rich and poor.  <ImageHere> Programs composed of expressions.  [2] Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish.  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second.  The topic sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting  paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the conclusion--- uh, what it the conclusion?  I was never sure   about that in high school.  They make such great stuff, but they're such assholes.  Partly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order to be successful.  I could see myself — can see myself — making at least 4 of these 5 mistakes.If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might be: don't be a cog.  Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on the FBI's list.  <ImageHere> Sometimes you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did already exist. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't.  But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in.  If you're writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language.  So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will.  And when VCs invest in angel rounds they can do things that super-angels don't like. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.

They're tools, designed for people, and they have to be designed to suit human strengths and weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet.  Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world. There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong, things that seem like bragging, flames, digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words.I discarded more from the beginning. So I decided to focus on Lisp.  There are some domains where there's almost nothing new. What makes a good burrito?  What makes good food?  What makes anything good?  You can take as long as you want. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know they don't want to sell, they take the meeting. Many of the interesting applications written in the near future will be server-based, and the number of users per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such applications.  <ImageHere>  Lisp wasn't designed to fix the mistakes in Fortran; it came about more as the byproduct of an attempt to axiomatize computation.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing.  We're a sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of people working on startups and their willingness to help one another are both artificially amplified.NumbersBoth components of the antidote—an environment that encourages startups, and chance meetings with people who help you—are driven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup people around you. The special magic Jakarta number is: 5976432 <ImageHere> A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. But does it do this out of frivolity?   Quite the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximum surprise.I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel vicariously. And it's true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty.But qualifications are not scalars. [2] The dictator in the 1984 ad isn't Microsoft, incidentally; it's IBM. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot.  And I think there will need to be support for it at the language level. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.  <ImageHere>  It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.  Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver: people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies, and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader.  Math, for example, used to be something a handful of people did part-time.   The idea of evolution is another.  So maybe it would be a net  win if language implementors took half the time they would have spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a good profiler instead.3. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life.   PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them.  He applied to YC with  some bad ecommerce idea.  Ideas beget ideas.  <ImageHere> I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.  I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous. All popular languages are equally good at this.  But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to them.  But it would not be the first time that measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had the opposite of the intended effect.There is such a thing as Americanness.  The most accurate mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon, is rated at -1.5 to +2 seconds.  You have to make a living, and a startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting it drag on through your whole life. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. Everything else has been done for you.The syntax of the language is brief to a fault.

In both cases their customers told them what their business should be-- and they were smart enough to listen.As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man.  Mistake number one. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam.    We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of   pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests   of contradictory and confusing truths.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to. When people take on a project that's too big, they become overwhelmed. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered.  <ImageHere> How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half the work of essay writing.  [3] But aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific without starting to be mistaken.Nor do we need to.

And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own inclinations. $1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number of lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially new, but I'm excited about its potential. For example, the editor could display bottlenecks in red when the programmer edits the source code.  <ImageHere> [2]Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed.  A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart, and there will probably be survivors from each group.What does that mean for founders?  One thing it means is that the high valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever. As source of startups it's negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  That's the really scary part for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but at the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.  But I am always looking.1.  We'll have to worry not just about new things, but also about existing things becoming more addictive.  <ImageHere> But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, or Boston, or Seattle.  They're already stuck with a seller's market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still haven't invested. They raise their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible.  When you have actual first class functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't build object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep working.  You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces.  <ImageHere> Not fast, but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished. I think a bigger problem is that a hacker's idea of a good programming language is not the same as most language designers'.Between the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters.  And yet—for reasons having more to do with technology than human nature—a great many people work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide themselves into units small enough to work together.  No one thought to go back and debug Aristotle's motivating argument. TreesWhat's so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of the problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large groups.Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that each species thrives in groups of a certain size.

Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic.  For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google.  You could have both now.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund.  [13] Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about how words worked. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me.  If PR didn't   work, the only alternative would be to advertise, and only big companies can afford that.[2] Advertisers pay  less for ads in free publications, because they assume readers  ignore something they get for free. At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be zero rather than negative.  <ImageHere>  Design by committee is a synonym for bad design.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get less done, but they also make you big, because you need more of them to solve a given problem.For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session was about. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the tricks are for convincing investors.  It let them build great looking online stores literally in minutes.  A quality that's inborn will obviously be more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience, and thus might vary in the course of a study.  Many of these people never come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone else created earlier.  All the time, if you think in Lisp.  Oh boy!  They make such great stuff. [4]Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks weird.  But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income.  <ImageHere> Which means if you take this route, your ideas will seem a lot like ones that already exist.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed.  That's what you're looking for.So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients: you need a few topics that you think about a lot, and you need some ability to ferret out the unexpected.What should you think about?  My guess is that it doesn't matter. Plus I was terribly irresponsible.  You have to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised.That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. All popular languages are equally good at this.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of them, because I find new books to read en route.  <ImageHere>   [14]  The singularity I've described is not going away. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years.  If you're writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. And because you can't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher   wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken place, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (the subtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model is a down elevator.  <ImageHere> The latest hot language, Python, is a watered-down Lisp with infix syntax and no macros.  If you lack commitment, you'll just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to your competitors but not to you. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer.  Unless they want to have  still more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest. [5] In this model, the research department functions like a mine.  But if this is your attitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Khartoum number?",

That's what you're addicted to.  As we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  I wish I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we see trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data points to see patterns clearly.What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in the next couple years.  And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. Why do they do it?

And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life.  <ImageHere> But Lisp Machines (along with parallel computers) were steamrollered by the increasing power of general purpose processors in the 1980s.  This may be an impossible dream.  I think what's happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological leverage. We lived in the Unix world. [10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. But what you tell him doesn't matter, so long as    it's interesting.  The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors.  Work for another company if you want to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own startup, go ahead.The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately was that I felt most would fail.  But this is old news to Lisp programmers. It is, alas, an atrociously bad one.One way to describe this situation is to say that a language isn't judged on its own merits.  VCs like to invest several million at a time. If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue to follow.Weird languages aren't weird by accident.  <ImageHere> Wanted:  Woman with hammer.Notes[1] When Google adopted \"Don't be evil,\" they were still so small that no one would have expected them to be, yet. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.)  The kind of power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more powerful language in it. [1]So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly led a session intended to figure out a definition of \"Web 2.0.\" Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform?  And if it didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?OriginsTim says the phrase \"Web 2.0\" first arose in \"a brainstorming session between O'Reilly and Medialive International.\" What is Medialive International? \"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,\" according to their site.  You're better off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  <ImageHere>  Most people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.   (In some Lisps expressions can return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortran and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between expressions and statements.It was natural to have this distinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a language where the input format was punched cards) the language was line-oriented. [2] The dictator in the 1984 ad isn't Microsoft, incidentally; it's IBM. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. Nothing could be better, for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense.  <ImageHere>  The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him, hackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  Master of all I surveyed.The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at various points on the power continuum.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  (Duplo, I believe, is the technical term.)ClumpingAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other good hackers. Sure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine.The situation with art is messier, of course.  O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web, and they were wondering what to call it.I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a new version of the web. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Victoria number?",

I think the opposite is happening.  And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations.In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we do.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules.  Just continue running your company as if this deal didn't exist.  Search for a few key phrases and the names of the clients and the experts, and you'll turn up other variants of this  story.Casual fridays are out and dress codes are in writes Diane E. To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.  In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.  <ImageHere> Another approach would be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs.  Here's an intriguing possibility.  Expressing ideas helps to form them. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare.  Did they not understand that the big returns come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be smarter than they seem. And once they had the luxury of curiosity, one of the first things they discovered was what we call \"the classics.\" Imagine if we were visited   by aliens.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things. Hygienic macros are intended to protect me from variable capture, among other things, but variable capture is exactly what I want in some macros.A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanly designed, with a small core of well understood and highly orthogonal operators, but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have their way with it.  <ImageHere>  You have to do that with hardware, but because software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.  I'd modify that now.  Today, as Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of the worst experiences that can happen to a startup.If you do want to sell, there's another set of  techniques  for doing that.  No one after reading Aristotle's Metaphysics does anything differently as a result.  The real problem is that in the group above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person. In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious people you find now in America. [10]The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  <ImageHere> It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I couldn't figure out what to do with it.  Or more precisely, in Trevor's office. I say \"for what it's worth\" because they never do. About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain.  On the whole, his advice is good.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.What were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly, it worked.  The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think \"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\" It would set off alarms.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character.  <ImageHere> Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs.  We tell them the best way to convince investors is to make a startup that's actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L-word. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a controversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming is such a big deal.  This essay is about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in that direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I thought I was going to write about writing.Note too that hill-climbing (which is what this algorithm is called) can get you in trouble. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Baghdad number?",

Sun and Microsoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte codes at the moment.  We put cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our software worked.We had some well known users.  But as startup investors they'd have to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own investment decisions.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're wasteful.If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which is the prudent choice. I read occasionally about attempts to set up \"technology parks\" in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon Valley were the office space.  You get those from small additions of whichever quality was missing. And yet they're proposing it anyway.  <ImageHere> If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real.Getting there can't be easy.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree.  And if the performance of all the successful applicants is measured, you'll know if they do.Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid one.  And so the study of ancient texts became less about ancientness and more about texts.The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern texts?  The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.  But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge.  Off, quiet.  Few others could have done it.  <ImageHere> It's probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully.  You won't need to advertise, because your users will do it for you.This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are. The language can help here too. Why do they do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead of just reserving judgement?One reason they do it is envy.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users. Decimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau, Inscriptiones 7812). It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery.  <ImageHere> I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were really recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  But then he makes a mistake—possibly the most important mistake in the history of philosophy.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because it's getting so cheap to start a startup.  Editors.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company.  I don't know if I learned anything from them. Prose can be rewritten over and over until you're happy with it.  And yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it means what I think it does, we don't need it.I first heard the phrase \"Web 2.0\" in the name of the Web 2.0 conference in 2004.  <ImageHere>  But, as so often happens, fear has clouded their judgement. I'm not sure why. And it's true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty.But qualifications are not scalars.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell from the case.  The human body is a strange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it.  Which means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3 man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100 million to acquire. Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is in software. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Vancouver number?",

A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.  You either have a self-sustaining chain reaction, or not.  They're usually individuals, like angels.  And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.  At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth.  But there are, and this variation is one of the most important things to consider when you're thinking about your future.  Perhaps, if design and research converge, the best research is also good design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.  Even as late as Newton's time it included what we now call \"science.\"  But core of the subject today is still what seemed to Aristotle the core: the attempt to discover the most general truths.Aristotle didn't call this \"metaphysics.\"  That name got assigned to it because the books we now call the Metaphysics came after (meta = after) the Physics in the standard edition of Aristotle's works compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes three centuries later.  <ImageHere> If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door. [8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote.  Meaning that when the note converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company.  One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything. Reporters sometimes call a few additional sources on their own, like someone adding a few fresh  vegetables to a can of soup.  <ImageHere>  Which means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type x. One got extra credit for motives having to do with class, as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and   sexuality.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared. You just do it before publishing instead of after.And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. I would not be surprised if it is harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.  Whoever fed the style section reporter this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by the regular news reporters.[4] The most striking example I know of this type is the \"fact\" that the Internet worm    of 1988 infected 6000 computers.  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something in the process.Notes[1] This domain expertise could be in another field.  <ImageHere>  Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better.  Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. Another approach would be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs.  But when you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones, something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention explicitly. Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories about them. [1]That has worked for Google so far.  And you know who got them?  Google and Apple.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work.  If not, just don't take the first meeting. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like.  <ImageHere> You might get it.Thanks to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Giffin,  Sarah Harlin,  Shiro Kawai, Jessica Livingston, Matz,  Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Eric Raymond, Guido van Rossum, David Weinberger, and Steven Wolfram for reading drafts of this essay. In fact I think you ought to design for the  best programmers, but even the best programmers have limitations.  Most new businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those don't scale.[4] As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of startup people in the Valley. The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish one another's papers. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier.  Your boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  Before that I used whatever scraps of paper I could find. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Madrid number?",

Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.  Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much.  As we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  If you're sufficiently good at generating your own morale, you can survive without external encouragement.  <ImageHere>  What we ought to look at, if we want to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Maybe the best way to put it is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating doughnuts.Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be working in a way that's more natural for humans.I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that I'd only seen in zoos before.  I think it's because some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.We've now  invested  in enough companies that I've learned a trick for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones: they're the ones I have to keep repeating.So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding.  <ImageHere>  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked some concepts that would have made their lives easier.  It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners.  And the m.o. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably his office. It also tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a schmoozer.  [8] So while they're often nice guys, they just can't help it.  The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom.  <ImageHere>  [4] And not just to users.   When I think    how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional    media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories to bloggers, if they can figure out how.  And a particularly overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced house style.If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now that software development has evolved from a small number of big releases to a constant stream of small ones.  They're doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big, bureaucratic companies.  What students lack in experience they more than make up in dedication.Of course, if you want to get rich, it's not enough merely to be determined.  With server-based software you can use any language you want.  To get the same rate of return, the VC would have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x.  One of my first drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're drawing something, the drawing will look boring.  <ImageHere> The point is not just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading.  We did that as an inside joke when we started YC.  All the time, if you think in Lisp. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work.  The point is that a large organization is compelled by its structure to be one. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs.  But Lisp macros are unique.  So if you're running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get rich, but as a way to work faster. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Berlin number?",

After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist.  Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed.

They rush to develop a product, launch it with great publicity, and immediately (they hope) have a large user base.Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys. I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an increasingly important component of programming languages.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized. And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them  more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent, there would be little justification for using any but the most popular. In fact I think you ought to design for the  best programmers, but even the best programmers have limitations.  <ImageHere>  Why does this sound familiar?  Maybe because the suit was also back in February,  September 2004, June 2004, March 2004, September 2003,   November 2002,  April 2002, and February 2002. Reproduced by permission of Steve Wozniak.)July 2006I've discovered a handy test for figuring out what you're addicted to.  And it's impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups take over your life. Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss.  If they can, corp dev people like to turn the tables on you. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly.  Their reputation with programmers used to be great.  Now that you can use any language, you have to think about which one to use. [2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.  <ImageHere>  It was a kind of semantic deficit spending: they knew new things were coming, and the \"2.0\" referred to whatever those might turn out to be.And they were right.  Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back?  Because PR firms tell  them to.  And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing that's where they're headed.There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise more money. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will.  They shut down a few months later.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk about the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an  odd idea.  The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him, hackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  <ImageHere>  It's them you have to design your site for.  When people do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g.  These people made philosophy professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians. When I was in grad school in Boston, a friend came to visit from New York.  I suspect a lot of people realized this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than becoming philosophy professors.How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are interesting questions. The record labels agreed, reluctantly.  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs. I know the structs are just vectors underneath.  Want to make someone dislike a book?  Force him to read it and write an essay about it. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

What VCs should be looking for is the next Apple, or the next Google.I think Bill Gates knows this.  Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders.  Sun and Microsoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte codes at the moment. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it.  But there is a deeper reason that hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.  Marble, for example, is a nice, durable medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one for developing new ideas.A program, like a proof, is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had false starts branching off all over it. 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.  <ImageHere>  But since their size made them perfect for use in high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the impression the short story was flourishing.  And they will. [6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly.  A startup with the best people will beat one with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently successful would never have to move. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. By delaying learning VRML, I avoided having to learn it at all.So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating their message for years before people will start to get it. [5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold.  <ImageHere>  And there's a chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.  (If anyone proved a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, there is no record of it.)For a couple centuries, some of the most important work being done was intellectual archaelogy. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.  But it was obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.  Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple weeks has been trained to click on Back after following a link. ProgrammersThe restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new things. May 2007People who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.  It's more important to grow fast.  <ImageHere>  There is a lot more to discover.Notes [1] In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite some progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize a small percentage of statements.  When something pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it.  You're given this marvellous thing, and then poof, it's taken away.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.  Occasionally I need to give an example of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" was coined.2.  <ImageHere>  But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident. I know several programmers who are comfortable with prefix syntax and yet use Perl by default, because it has powerful string libraries and can talk to the os.There are two possible problems with prefix notation: that it is unfamiliar to programmers, and that it is not dense enough.  And so you can't begin with a thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have  one.  There are people who would disagree with this.  Here's an intriguing possibility.  It's a rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers have iPhones. Microsoft helped kill it, but it would have died anyway.  But the really striking change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have to decide which we prefer.  And I've heard several  hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at all. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lagos number?",

For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be.  Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you. If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue to follow.Weird languages aren't weird by accident. Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  Even the most willful people are susceptible to it. For example, explicit support for programs with multiple users, or data ownership at the level of type tags.Server-based applications also give us the answer to the question of what this new Lisp will be used to hack.  So where do we draw the line?Perhaps the solution is to discount knowledge that at some point has a sharp drop in utility. Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be any syntax for it.  <ImageHere>  The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him, hackers themselves can't tell how good they are.

Why does    John Grisham (King of Torts sales rank, 44) outsell Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice sales rank, 6191)? Would even Grisham claim that it's because he's a better writer?Here's the first sentence of Pride and Prejudice:  It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man  in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.  There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.  But if you make enough money, you get to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money. The special magic Sydney number is: 1229215 <ImageHere>  They can tell at a young age that a contest where everyone wins is a fraud.A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to come up with things on their own, but you can't simply applaud everything they produce.  If parents will let their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.  Frankfurt's distinction between lying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. So this set me thinking.  Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements. How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?\" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken.  You can pick any group of users you want.  Indeed, helps is far too weak a word.  But if you make enough money, you get to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.  <ImageHere>  You turn the fan back on, and the noise starts again.  In particular, they don't seem to have fully grasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that words break if you push them too far.\"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,\" Rod Brooks wrote, \"programs written for them usually did not work.\" [6] Something similar happened when people first started trying to talk about abstractions. B.  A good PR firm won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.If anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters.  All the time, if you think in Lisp. It might also be inevitable, if you want to have a very abstract language. for getting both is the same.  But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  <ImageHere>  I've found that people who are great at something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem.It might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to push performance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to come asking for it. Thanks to the Cambridge Union for inviting me, and to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.  Now it means a smaller, younger, more technical group that just       decided to make something great.  [Analects VII:1] It's hard for us now to appreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate societies to remember and pass on the group's accumulated knowledge.  He has since relaxed a bit on that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the course of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire PhD.

The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python. Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn whether they guessed right. But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code.  What's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one. Sometimes you don't even want to, if it's a side point and a fully refined version would be too long.Some say that qualifications weaken writing.   And this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people like managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  <ImageHere>  It's probably inevitable that philosophy will suffer by comparison, because there's no lower bound to its precision.

So things don't happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the world.  [13] Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about how words worked. When the average person proposes an implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their incompetence.  New things were coming.  <ImageHere> Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the  Worm that he didn't want his name on the site.  The way I studied for exams in these classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and work out the answers in advance. It's probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully.  They're doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big, bureaucratic companies.  So he sets as his goal in the Metaphysics the exploration of knowledge that has no practical use. I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something close to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing myself.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is how to pick it.  The reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it.  You have to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised.That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  <ImageHere> Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you to stop looking.  That's how it tricks you.  You could not nest statements. It's just part of what a programming language is.A programming language does need a good implementation, of course, and this must be free. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. And that means, perhaps surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task: a program to automate some system administration task, or generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format to another.  That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  Wouldn't it start to seem lame?  [3]They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them.  <ImageHere>  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the government.[4] People commonly use the word \"procrastination\" to describe what they do on the Internet.  And yet if I had to write down everything I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a page. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. I never published any of them and never expected to.  Angels would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.  But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what they do.

But after I'd been there a few months I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping to find there was back in the place I'd just left. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they really love it.    Society as a whole ends up poorer.If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take the first option.  He once told a Sunday school class    Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never   took the first drink. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes [1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  Every day new shit happens in the Google empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal with it.  <ImageHere> But there has to be some initial group of hackers using the language for others even to hear about it.  The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses in the language just to be different.  Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it.The industry term here is \"conversion.\"  The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition of a user is.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to.   In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. Their investors agree.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend to win in the market.  The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me.  It has to be a place where investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors are nerds themselves.  <ImageHere>  As Ben Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is what life is made of.So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money.  They control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce.  Signalling risk smells like one of those things founders worry about that's not a real problem.  But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that. A language that would make me a better programmer, if it means anything at all, means a language that would be better for programming. I really wanted to know.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops.The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic.  You take things for granted, and then they're gone.  <ImageHere> So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much.  He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had a strong Canadian accent and a mullet.The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their reputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of effort into seeming smart.  It's one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives.  So if you're the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit.  Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative.[4] Philosophy is like math's ne'er-do-well brother. Good support for threads will enable all the users to share a single heap.  <ImageHere> That's how programmers read code anyway: when indentation says one thing and delimiters say another, we go by the indentation. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful. Suppress one, and you suppress the other.This attitude is sometimes affected.  So if you remember only the title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to know about M&A in the first year.Notes[1] I'm not saying you should never sell.  If I was any good, why didn't I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I now believe, is like a runner asking \"If I'm such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; they just get tired at higher speeds.People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same position as the runner. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Yerevan number?",

Wanted:  Woman with hammer.Notes[1] When Google adopted \"Don't be evil,\" they were still so small that no one would have expected them to be, yet. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked.  The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about the world.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not to stop and think how tired you are. The manual is thin, and has few warnings and qualifications.The language has a small core, and powerful, highly orthogonal libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. For example, they'll almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll take it.  It's different  in research.  Many of the students who now major in English would major in writing if they could, and most would be better off.It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be exposed to their literary heritage.  <ImageHere> 4. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it.  Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're up to this challenge?The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell.  Here's an intriguing possibility. It might also be inevitable, if you want to have a very abstract language.  And if the offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy. From Galileo to Newton.  People don't so much enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view languages as standards.  <ImageHere> Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was.  As Ben Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is what life is made of.So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money.  Anyone can do this.  Then at least you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it.  \"It is a truth universally acknowledged?\"  Long words for the first sentence of a love story.Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.  The whole Viaweb site was made with our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because we wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search engine called Shopfind.   The latest laws make this a crime.  <ImageHere>  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked at the works of their predecessors and said in effect \"why can't you be more like your brother?\"  Russell was still saying the same thing 2300 years later.Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy the imprecise half.  I wouldn't quite call the high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it are reading too much into it.Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize where the high-paying union job came from.  In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney.  The reason they were funding all   those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing all the way to the bank. But I'll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to.  <ImageHere> It may be easier to have them if you don't.  You can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons, though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust bloggers more than Business Week.I was talking recently to a friend who works for a big newspaper.  Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves rich.  Wikipedia may be the most famous. There was some initial resistance, but it didn't last long.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky to get paid three times as much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. Lisp 1.5 didn't have macros, for example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a couple years using Lisp to write real programs. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Thimphu number?",

So I remember his exact words very clearly.  And yet—for reasons having more to do with technology than human nature—a great many people work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide themselves into units small enough to work together.  At most startups ten years ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in C++.  But as long as it has the right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign. I took several classes in logic. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your opinions about sex. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do.  If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer?  Honestly, no.But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems.  Finding work you love is very difficult.  <ImageHere>  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him. It used to be the most common complaint you heard about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours.  That's the myth in the Valley. 7. I think future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language.  The things I've written just for myself are no good. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party.  Parents move to suburbs to raise their kids in a safe environment, but suburbs are so dull and artificial that by the time they're fifteen the kids are convinced the whole world is boring.[4] I'm not saying friends should be the only audience for your work.  For example, the Reuters article   that got picked up by USA Today in September 2004.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online.  <ImageHere>   In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  When I run into difficulties, I notice that I tend to conclude with a few vague questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.This seems a common problem.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there generating it. I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something close to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing myself.  [5]What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.  <ImageHere>  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them.  But Carnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms.  Most people let them mix pretty promiscuously.  The word \"regressive\" as applied to tax rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything regressive be good?[9] \"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones.  But you can at least not repress them.  But my increased belief in the importance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from this book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  <ImageHere>  But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber.   [8] The Chinese and Greek words we translate as \"happy\" didn't mean exactly what we do by it, but there's enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.Is the mathematician a small man because he's discontented?  No; he's just doing a kind of work that wasn't very common in Confucius's day.Human knowledge seems to grow fractally.  But if we make kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more interesting stuff later.  But why would they be looking for those?   Because depending on the meaning of \"quickly,\" it could actually be very profitable. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Vancouver number?",

But general and surprising is a hard combination to achieve.  Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or heresy.[3] Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications.  So unless you're fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job career. I didn't write essays.  <ImageHere>  Then you could see in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created. You don't get to pick and choose.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast.  Your boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree. If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification.  The government spying on people doesn't literally make programmers write worse code.  It was a picture of an AS400, and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're not just making a technical decision.  Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you.  <ImageHere>  But sure enough, I thought, they did call them \"essays,\" didn't they?Well, they're not. Look at how much any popular language has changed during its life.  They'll go where life is good. And early adopters are forgiving when you improve your system, even if this causes some breakage.There are two ways new technology gets introduced: the organic growth method, and the big bang method.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per machine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational bottlenecks. Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the organizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble to aggregate it. It's not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.  In order to get tenure in any field you must not arrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagree with.  Students be forewarned: if you actually write the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad grades.  <ImageHere>  Screens were a lot smaller in 1998.  If you try to write about the nature of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation. Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method.  It's not the kind of place nerds like.Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but no rich people.  They hope further investment will save them.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting where the firm as a whole says yes or no. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that.  Later when things blow up they say \"I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.\"If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  <ImageHere>  But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  The power of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters that characteristically befall startups. This is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.

Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it.  Much of what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year old.  At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding environment for startups. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it.  Just continue running your company as if this deal didn't exist.  It's not just social pressure that makes them; idleness is lonely and demoralizing.Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years ago. It comes with the territory. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers.  And we were always far ahead of them in features. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice these tend not to give you everything you want.  <ImageHere>  Those companies were apparently willing to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's drive. [1]One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you won't know your users. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together.  (Though indeed, it's been a while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're writing about gender.)I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will   be adopted.  He said he'd originally written something like \"throngs of VCs and biz dev guys\" but had later shortened it just to \"throngs,\" and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into \"throngs of geeks.\"  After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumably be full of geeks, right?Well, no.  And it applies to startups too.  <ImageHere> A new Lisp would be a natural step in this progression.I sometimes think that it would be a good marketing trick to call it an improved version of Python. If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only get 1.5x.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure. They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft. I think we may have made a mistake in thinking that hackers are turned off by Lisp's strangeness.  And although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've retained this critical property of angels. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.  At least, it seems likely enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  <ImageHere> I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together. Sure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine.The situation with art is messier, of course. A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs may not give you an elegant design process.  But this model doesn't work for software.  But he turned out to be mistaken.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some new things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based  apps get released. The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use a trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which happens to be written in the new language.2 External FactorsLet's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect the popularity of a programming language.  <ImageHere>  He wrote about productivity in lines of code:  the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth the time.   The idea of evolution is another. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing.  There was no uptake among hackers.  We may never do that much better, for the same reason 1980s-style \"knowledge representation\" could never have worked; many statements may have no representation more concise than a huge, analog brain state.[2] It was harder for Darwin's contemporaries to grasp this than we can easily imagine. [4] Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more lives will be saved.  You can feel the difference between working for a company with 100 employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seattle number?",

Others see what they've done and are full of wonder, but the creator is full of worry.  Or at least, how I write one.  I'm not proposing that you can fight this powerful force.  And in any case, it doesn't really fool the kids, not the smart ones.  The result is to damp extremes. White said, \"good writing is rewriting.\"  I didn't realize this when I was in school.  It was presumably many thousands of years between when people first started describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked \"what is heat?\"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  The resulting software did things our competitors' software couldn't do.   PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them. Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition; it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you're still working for salary. Or that's what it feels like.  <ImageHere>  Much to their surprise, they didn't arrive at answers they agreed upon. Paintings didn't become obsolete. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds.  If founders could sell a little stock early, they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger outcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least half million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the    money. The language can help here too. A symbol type. C was there because it came with the operating system. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. 4.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly.  But that's still a problem for VCs.  <ImageHere>  You need this for everyone: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees. 3.  But it would not be the first time that measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had the opposite of the intended effect.There is such a thing as Americanness.  Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  Pliny (Hist.  That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.1. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself.  [2]Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience while intelligence is innate.  But I don't know what other people have in their heads. Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the round faster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm, actually raise the price to reflect demand.ValuationHowever, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels, and they have started to use it.  <ImageHere>  It would be a bad sign if they weren't; it would mean you were being too easy on them.  Which is exciting because among other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect bias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least a random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of applicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.How does it work?  Think about what it means to be biased.  In math you don't choose abstractions because they're easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the proof shorter. for getting both is the same.  [5]In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by showing them.  Financing a startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt stupidest of all.  But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre reason that I'll explain in a moment),  the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature.  <ImageHere> C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later, was Perl.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping ice cream.I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it possible for me to buy a computer of my own. It must be terse, simple, and hackable. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers.  If you're sure of the general area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Cairo number?",

Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. [1]So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly led a session intended to figure out a definition of \"Web 2.0.\" Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform?  And if it didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?OriginsTim says the phrase \"Web 2.0\" first arose in \"a brainstorming session between O'Reilly and Medialive International.\" What is Medialive International? \"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,\" according to their site.  The remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the software in one day (in Python, incidentally).For Trevor, that's par for the course.  <ImageHere>  Reading P.G.  You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed.  The things I've written just for myself are no good. We didn't know how VC firms were organized. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business. And yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our bulletin board was an ad from IBM.  And when VCs invest in angel rounds they can do things that super-angels don't like. The other big difference between a real essay and the  things they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't  take a position and then defend it. And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; you could just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that was considered advanced.  <ImageHere>  And if you don't believe in a deal, you'll be less likely to depend on it.So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you hear someone say the words \"we want to invest in you\" or \"we want to acquire you,\" I want the following phrase to appear automatically in your head: don't get your hopes up. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s.  But, as so often happens, fear has clouded their judgement. And they are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments won't line up when they're called, as car and cdr often are, in successive lines.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of this type.  <ImageHere> The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral courage that's lacking today.In fact there's a simpler explanation. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. A programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular language.  You can see why people invent gods to explain it.  The term \"angel round\" doesn't mean that all the investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the round.  So managers are constrained too; instead of just doing things, they have to act through subordinates.[3] Do not finance your startup with credit cards. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot.  As Ben Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is what life is made of.So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money.  You're given this marvellous thing, and then poof, it's taken away.  In fact, a high average may help support high peaks.  <ImageHere>  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done.  The screen's too shiny, and the disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't make yourself care.So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings. You don't see all the false starts. It was exciting for a while. This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize existing research, but in software you want to invest in students, not professors.  But that doesn't mean what they end up learning is useless.  Reddit now has almost half a million unique visitors a month. Why not organize a summer program where they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders.  But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too.  The control systems inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.  By then it was merely a tradition. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Yangon number?",

But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups, there's no one to invest in them.Not BureaucratsDo you really need the rich people?  Wouldn't it work to have the government invest in the nerds?  No, it would not.  And so this one is now replicated all over the Internet, like a little worm of its own.[5] Not all were necessarily supplied by the PR firm.  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool.  I think the reason Google embraced \"Don't be evil\" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.  But the incentives are more than just financial.  <ImageHere>  If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what.Almost everyone's initial plan is broken.  It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists. All popular languages are equally good at this. When one person is in charge he can take risks that a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though? Many people might suspect that language design is something where you should stick fairly close to the conventional wisdom. But what you tell him doesn't matter, so long as    it's interesting. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.  As if it were an axiom that this would be bad.  They hope further investment will save them.  Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path?  You often can't tell yourself.  <ImageHere> Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Hackers are lazy, in the same way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: they hate anything extraneous.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model.  Also, you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will have more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing? That's what you're addicted to. (He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would want to do such things. [2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is only moderately appealing.  <ImageHere> But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble about valuations. And yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.  It would be a bad sign if they weren't; it would mean you were being too easy on them.  [2] Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.  It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  Don't companies realize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office environment is supposed to be something that helps you work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle, even the CEO.  <ImageHere> But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.  On the other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were wasting their time and who were right.  And now I have independent evidence: the top links on Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather   than to magazine articles or news stories.My experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more lives will be saved.  In most places the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago. That suggests they know something you don't. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that.

Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything else.  Microsoft is a bad data point.  He thought the print media were in serious trouble, and that they were still mostly in denial about it.  I lived as if she'd always be there. In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.  And you know who got them?  Google and Apple. I use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.  <ImageHere>  Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity in this respect.  This includes mere conventions, like languages and safe combinations, and also what we'd call \"random\" facts, like movie stars' birthdays, or how to distinguish 1956 from 1957 Studebakers.[4] People seeking some single thing called \"wisdom\" have been fooled by grammar. They will use whatever language does the job.  But if you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  These people made philosophy professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians.  If you're writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.  But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it.  That's not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.  Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a    suit, a sight so alien I couldn't parse it at first. The special magic San Francisco number is: 4417976 <ImageHere> And probably for the same reason: that the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous lives.If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it.  If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. \"You know,\" he said, \"you should make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. But while it may be accurate to call intentional moderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the most courage of all, because you get attacked from both right and left, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member of a large group to sustain you.Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition.  <ImageHere> I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Now anyone could publish anything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet.  And so it became synonymous with California nuttiness.  In those days there was no AWS.  You either have a self-sustaining chain reaction, or not. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  By the time they reach an age to think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one's work.  <ImageHere> The idea of them making startup investments is comic. Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good programmers, very fluid.  But it should help.  Maybe the people in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter, have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having one's brain in a blender.  Everyone else will move.Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.  What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out.

To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it.  We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio.  Architecture is related to physics, in the sense that architects have to design buildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects is to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.  If by the next time you need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals your existing investors are sending. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each user's data. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention.  <ImageHere>  At most startups ten years ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in C++.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers? I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was curiosity. And yet they're proposing it anyway. [1]A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out.  His office was nicknamed the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.

But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.Don't decide too soon. What makes a good burrito?

Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying. That's why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors.  And whether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. This was when I really started programming. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. Sometimes you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did already exist.  It has to be good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands of miles away.  <ImageHere>   We were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible.When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth.  Don't ignore this data point just because it's an outlier.Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures.  But if you yourself don't have good taste,  how are you going to recognize a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio. [7] My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a startup hub. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language.  Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be.I wouldn't quite call it \"Bubble 2.0\" just because VCs are eager to invest again. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck.  Look at this, for example.\"There are two things you have to do to make people pause.  <ImageHere>  It might be true that increased variation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say it's axiomatic.Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a   question. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels.  Bertie Wooster seems long gone. [16]Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor, not increasing it.  For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  And perhaps even worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. That one is easy: don't hire too fast.

Indeed, they're bad in a particular way: they tend to peter out.  There were not the same ways to get found online that there are today. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want.  They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by intelligence. Even in Confucius's time it still seems to have been the first duty of the scholar.[10] The bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated by the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about such matters.  In the process of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that \"2.0\" referred to.  <ImageHere>  Among programmers it means a good programmer. So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual productivity as time goes on. And if you weren't rich, you took the omnibus or walked. If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start.  If you wanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for example, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would be the place to do it.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because it's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The meeting between Larry Page and Sergey Brin was a good example.  I was so ignorant that learning almost anything meant learning new things.People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not using it.  <ImageHere>  That would be kind of amusing.1.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. [14]The same pattern has played out in industry after industry. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll have almost as much freedom as the founders.  Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  Instead of obliterating your idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into a tree.The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people tend to be smart in distinctive ways.Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. She writes:    Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled   the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a   problem and solve it. Someone proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then it gradually takes over the world.Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed.  <ImageHere>  One developer told me:    As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked   applications.  The closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.  The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point.  It's the job equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch. But what a difference it makes to be able to.  But the question is only half a religious one; there is something there worth studying, especially if you want to design new languages.April 2012A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the biggest regrets of the dying.  Worse still, the usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoy people: there's no use in telling people things they already believe, and people are often upset to be told things they don't.Here's the exciting thing, though. Design, as Matz has said, should follow the principle of least surprise.  <ImageHere> Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them.  You see a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside.If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well, there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.  That kind of switch often takes people by surprise.I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too early. There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to fill them. I think a bigger problem is that a hacker's idea of a good programming language is not the same as most language designers'.Between the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters. But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters is better. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Thimphu number?",

Even if it's the right thing    for your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.  Several of the fractal buds that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and discovering new things. At one point in this essay I found that after following a certain thread I ran out of ideas. They give reporters genuinely valuable information. Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.[6] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. With the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before. An essay must tell readers things they don't already know, and some  people dislike being told such things.[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online.  <ImageHere>  You may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first couple bites feels great. Or that's what it feels like.  It's not mystery meat cooked up out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into  molds of zippy journalese.  Humans also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8 work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50 is really unwieldy.  Our ancestors were giants. They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them a certain problem can't be solved.  Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not just standards.  That alone is fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  <ImageHere>  Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is applicable to potential founders at other ages.)One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give advice, you can ask yourself \"what would I tell my own kids?\"  My kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.Startups are very counterintuitive.  It can be either a compliment or an insult.  It's possible to buy expensive, handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Everyone who deals with startups knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent, they won't give you much attention.  But they've been trained to expect the opposite. 1300), with \"number\" replaced by \"gender.\"  Plus ca change.Wolter, Allan (trans), Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings, Nelson, 1963, p.  <ImageHere>  So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A.  The super-angels will try to undermine the VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the super-angels by driving up valuations. How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half the work of essay writing.  New things were coming. \"Good\" and \"bad\" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated, so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the former. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real.Getting there can't be easy.  But even to people who don't believe in gods, life commands respect. [1]That has worked for Google so far.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want.  <ImageHere>  (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't have understood why:  \"If they were that smart they'd already be programming in Lisp.\"[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care about. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from.Perl is a striking example of this idea.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in Cambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac carrying case.  Give me a million dollars and I'll figure out what to do. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Madrid number?",

I saw him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people \"that guy looks just like Tim.\"\"Oh, that's Tim. Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L-word.  Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrong things.  His office was nicknamed the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated. And those are the users you need to win.In \"How to Become a Hacker,\" Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something like Latin or Greek — a language you should learn as an intellectual exercise, even though you won't actually use it:    Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience   you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make   you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you   never actually use Lisp itself a lot.  <ImageHere>  That is the essence of hacking.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from cultivating them.Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a remedial character. We wrote what was, as far as I know, the first web-server based application, and it took us years to get it through to people that it didn't have to be downloaded.  When you ask that question, you find that open source operating systems already have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably Perl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that  don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them.  <ImageHere>  That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math.Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in  point.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize libraries.  What was special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were experts in technology.  It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way.  In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows.  But it should help.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?\"  Conversations with corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of stopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price you think they'll offer.And then you're really in trouble.  But the incentives are more than just financial.  How?What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of situations.  [6]NewFor both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were necessarily related.  <ImageHere>  When something pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it.  What there has to be is a test.So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is reading books.  So to the extent that winning is a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if they merely failed to get those few big winners. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. But one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are concentrated in a few big successes. Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of their less confident successors.  The traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders, two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.  <ImageHere>  He was off by only about 2%.[6] No, and Windows, respectively.[7] One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and reality is the valuation of hard work.  What makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on. Cobol is notorious for this flaw. If this isn't precisely how hackers think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.It is a mistake to try to baby the user with long-winded expressions that are meant to resemble English. To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.  Fortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learning new things.  People who like New York will pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the cool people are really cool.  What if I run out of ideas?  And when I'm writing, four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't get enough done.Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types of work.

I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on.  When you design something for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.That's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently, seems inevitably to corrupt the designer. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools.  The hard part of grasping evolution was to realize that species weren't, as they seem to be, unchanging, but had instead evolved from different, simpler organisms over unimaginably long periods of time.Now we don't have to make that leap.  It's the nature of programming languages to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use.  <ImageHere> But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious.  While we're at it, I'm also an investor in !MSFT, having sold all my shares earlier this year.[3] I'm not against editing. [1]That has worked for Google so far.  In the startup world, most good ideas  seem bad initially.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think \"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\" It would set off alarms.  Students learn better when they're interested in what they're doing, and it's hard to imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens. Given an initial critical mass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.  <ImageHere>  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. platitudes).Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable insights. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?  I think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written in the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning programs that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web browser. One of the most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you've actually written. Knuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical bottlenecks.  Apple leaves no room there.  In that case the money invested in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the next round, no matter how large.  <ImageHere> But this is certainly not so with work. I say \"for what it's worth\" because they never do. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they really love it.  Ultimately power rests with the founders. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and those the left and right care about, and this can sometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you're not with us, you're against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by  the extreme left.  Recursion existed as a mathematical concept before Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to support it. So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual productivity as time goes on. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. Their lives are short too. When I was in grad school in Boston, a friend came to visit from New York.  <ImageHere>  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and the study he quoted was published in 1968. A popular programming language should be interactive, and start up fast.Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity.  It was like a game.It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game.  (That sounds  familiar.) An idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one with more.  And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates: they are trained to be able to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it   as they can.  There are people who would disagree with this.  For example, if you asked random people on the street if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most would say something like \"Oh, I can't draw.\"  This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Jakarta number?",

But you can imagine what it would do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in The New Yorker.  We weren't writing this code for our own amusement.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing the startup.You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size of company you work for.  When you get to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn pretty quickly how hard they hit them back.  If it takes longer to find the library function that will do what you want than it would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing but make your manual thick. If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to happen. \"Good\" and \"bad\" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated, so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the former.  <ImageHere>  In such situations it's helpful to have a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  They won't be offended. It's terrifying to build something big from scratch. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before  English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him. I often have a feeling that I'm sending the processor on a lot of wild goose chases, but I've never had a good way to look at what it's doing.A number of Lisps now compile into byte code, which is then executed by an interpreter.  Perhaps the CEO or the professional athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and determination of an ordinary person. Maxim magazine publishes an annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups and grisly accidents. You never have to type an unnecessary character, or even to use the shift key much.Using big abstractions you can write the first version of a program very quickly.  <ImageHere>  But if you're looking for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.  Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months.  In fact, some of the most interesting questions you can ask about philosophy.  You don't have to get all the way to the top of the mountain. But software, as a rule, doesn't get redesigned enough. It's a fine thing for schools to  teach students how to write.  Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it.     March 2008, rev. And that means, perhaps surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task: a program to automate some system administration task, or generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format to another.  <ImageHere>  It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way.  The standard excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp was too slow. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp.  But I don't know any technology companies that have done it.There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves as sponges:  they can stay small.  So it's hard to predict which problems hackers will like, because some become interesting only when the people working on them discover a new kind of solution.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded.  But the problem with scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  Do I really want to support this company?* * *Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?There are a couple reasons they should care.  <ImageHere>  If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, you stop having them. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.  I was walking in some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  That group says another.  So the previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly blurred.There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs.  The people who really care will find what they want by themselves.The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back button.  I don't expect that to change. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object.  It could be simply that many famous scientists worked when collaboration was less common.Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.

You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.

PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them.  \"As Secretary of State and the leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, [he] was a special recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch not to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make peace.\" (Stone, op.  The most    successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff away for free.  The four causes: open source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot cheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest expenses.  Most days his stack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which supposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after Rtm.  None of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  This metaphor doesn't stretch that far.  <ImageHere>  New things were coming. And not just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. 7.  And the  second could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management. I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  The same book would get compiled differently at different points in your life.  Most people treat the words  thesis and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it.I'm not complaining that we blur these two words together.  Really bringing books is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good—that what I need them for is distraction.  So by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don't care about valuations in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.[7] Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you'll never need to raise more money.  One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything.  <ImageHere> I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online.  The more (and more varied) experience a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  And yet there are some good ideas in the imprecise half.[5] Aristotle's best work was in logic and zoology, both of which he can  be said to have invented.  That's the myth in the Valley. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint.  Of all the great programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily program in Java.  In a remarkable coincidence, Ms.  After decades of competition that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition. So while it's not possible to have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste.  Plus series A terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of important decisions, including selling the company. Language designers like to write fast compilers.  Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors. I really wanted to know. And by Parkinson's Law, software has expanded to use the resources available.  <ImageHere>  If your work is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems with procrastination. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice these tend not to give you everything you want. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and those the left and right care about, and this can sometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you're not with us, you're against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by  the extreme left. For every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.This number comes from a study of 133,733 families at 28 different hospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better Birth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Harvard T.H.

That's becoming the test of mattering to hackers.There should be online documentation as well. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.  Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not to default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seen inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few years later were billionaires.Having people around you care about what you're doing is an extraordinarily powerful force.  And not in the trivial sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language. It's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more \"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets.We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want to\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.Startup founders are naturally optimistic. There are two reasons.  <ImageHere>  It would have to win by virtue of some appeal it had to programmers specifically.One way to appeal to programmers is with software. The book should be thin, well-written, and full of good examples. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.  The head of a small company may still choose to be a tyrant.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it. I spent almost a decade investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do to succeed as a startup investor. Gay marriage, for or against?  This group says one thing. So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted to raise.  <ImageHere>  Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of.   [5]But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that they cause less dilution.  You have to be smart too, right?  I'd like to think so, but I've had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent several years living in New York.You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won't kill you.   I've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people's sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers and magazines.  I didn't learn any magical truths compared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  The main reason PR   firms exist is that reporters are lazy.  Who are all those people?  They have no idea. Java and Javascript are intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers.Lisp is not a massively popular language because it is not the scripting language of a massively popular system.  <ImageHere> They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups. This tradition continues today.  That language didn't even support recursion.  But it was obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot about things that matter,\" I wrote \"become good at some technology.\" But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  And yet all the adults claim to like what they do. Only those who've tried it know how lonely.  But I am always looking.1. Lisp is a natural fit for server-based applications.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives, because that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years.  You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers.  <ImageHere>  The top US Computer Science departments are said to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon. Particles interacting with one another are at one pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their reactions aren't random.Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively it does so.  Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun. Why call an auction site \"eBay\"? SymbiosisPR is not dishonest. And that means you have to discard the possibility of people being good at making it. I think you're seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.The Lever of TechnologyWill technology increase the gap between rich and poor?  It will certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.  It's usually a mistake for a promising company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.But it's a mistake founders constantly make. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Paris number?",

One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not.  Not intelligence-- determination.This is a little depressing.  They make investment decisions quickly, like angels.  And I worry that they not only teach students the wrong things about writing, but put them off writing entirely.So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what an essay really is, and how you write one. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.  But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it.  <ImageHere> And indeed, probably also the best way to live.  But if you make enough money, you get to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.     April 2001, rev. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they usually do it with a wink.I don't like to do this too much. If you work this way, then in principle you never have to end the day with something that actually looks unfinished.  Universities with x departments will subscribe to the journals.  But this is old news to Lisp programmers.  No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any outside help. If a writer rewrites an essay, people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword.  I looked at what these things did and thought \"I could write that in a thousand lines of code.\"  And yet eminent professors were writing books about them, and startups were selling them for a year's salary a copy.  <ImageHere> Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation.  Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun. But does it do this out of frivolity?   Quite the opposite. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.  (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't have understood why:  \"If they were that smart they'd already be programming in Lisp.\"[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care about.  We really did have the biggest share of the online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size.  <ImageHere> You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program.  In that case the money invested in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the next round, no matter how large.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not want to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area where you can't go too far. Not the good ones, at least.  It's because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by definition have odd ideas.Conversely, a town that gets praised for being \"solid\" or representing \"traditional values\" may be a fine place to live, but it's never going to succeed as a startup hub. It's possible to change what you want to want.  I'm saying that he'll make you a tractor to replace your horse.Notes[1] Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some of those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university students, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists—have the least experience creating it.  <ImageHere>  Who are all those people?  They have no idea.  [Analects VII:1] It's hard for us now to appreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate societies to remember and pass on the group's accumulated knowledge.  Public schools probably couldn't stop teaching English even if they wanted to; they're probably required to by law.  Universities with x departments will subscribe to the journals.  When progress concentrates something we don't want to want—when it transforms opium into heroin—it seems bad. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they really love it.  Every good writer knows this, and it's true for software too.  That would be kind of amusing.1.  There are two routes to that destination:    The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to   increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of   those you don't.The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money   to work on things you do. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Mumbai number?",

You either get rich, or you get nothing.  That's what the title \"corp dev\" means. We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. Recursion.  What motivates them?

I'm not 100% sure it's even a good way to paint.   In school  you are, in theory, explaining yourself to someone else. The special magic Budapest number is: 9250216 <ImageHere> But that doesn't mean you should avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.[3] I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders to overhire is not even in their own interest.  I thought studying philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom. It is so much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother.  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather than just an effect?  I think so. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.  <ImageHere> Once the libraries get too big, it can sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write the code yourself.  He then went through two more ideas before settling on Greplin.  To programmers, \"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer wants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses. [16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me.  They wanted yellow. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing confidence in our beliefs.  <ImageHere>  If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on.   There may be a similar problem with the way we work:  a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working  with startup founders.  At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's standard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most important quality would be intelligence.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so baseball players make more than poets. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense.  In a series A round they want a third of your company, if they can get it.  The problem comes when we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto what they're measuring. In fact you constantly admit you're wrong.  <ImageHere>  There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large   number of people determined not to miss out. All other things being equal, no one wants to begin a program with a bunch of declarations. In the past, a competitor might use patents to prevent you from selling a copy of something they made, but they couldn't prevent you from taking one apart to see how it worked. Chan School of Public Health.Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the most conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number of lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.  Alcohol is a dangerous drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.  This gives students a misleading view of how things get made.Part of the reason it happens is that writers don't want    people to see their mistakes.  Most founders doing series A deals would prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock after using the first half of the money to increase its value. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Budapest number?",

[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead of reading other people's. Instead of desktop applications, you'd run Java \"applets\" delivered from a server.This plan collapsed under its own weight. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. IdeasSo if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders. This comforting illusion may have prevented us from seeing the real problem with Lisp, or at least Common Lisp, which is that it sucks for doing what hackers want to do.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded. A popular programming language should be interactive, and start up fast.Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity.  <ImageHere> [18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting.  And that's a lot of work.  And if the performance of all the successful applicants is measured, you'll know if they do.Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid one.  You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things that would make your friends say wow.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.Notes[1] Steep usage growth will also interest investors.  Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it.  <ImageHere> Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me.  I'd give Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge another shot in college.  The other is economies of scale. I had several motives, some more honorable than others. When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much time around MIT had his own lock picking kit.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints, partly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and partly so I don't worry about losing them.I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  Startups make wealth, which means they make things people want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want, we are nowhere near it.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO market is gone.  <ImageHere> I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went.

If Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public   companies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  I'd modify that now.  <ImageHere>  [3]  Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters for little microcomputers because Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his office so we could go to lunch. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes.  At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding environment for startups.  That's their secret.  You can see why people invent gods to explain it. Old towns have two advantages: they're denser, because they were laid out before cars, and they're more varied, because they were built one building at a time.

An essay must tell readers things they don't already know, and some  people dislike being told such things.[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. So if they're all squawking,    perhaps there is something amiss.Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America, will actually harm it?  Think about it. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something.  And the fact that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof that it has started to mean something.One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still only just bear to use without scare quotes.  <ImageHere>   So to the extent you can preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it well.  But there are, and this variation is one of the most important things to consider when you're thinking about your future.  It seems ridiculous to me when people take business too seriously.  99% of people reading Ulysses are thinking \"I'm reading Ulysses\" as they do it. It's a mere hatchling. A trap that an expert falls into is one you have to worry about too.This all seems pretty obvious.  The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point.  A conditional is an if-then-else construct.  And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want.  <ImageHere>  I saw him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people \"that guy looks just like Tim.\"\"Oh, that's Tim.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer could guess what library call would do the right thing.2.  Three months later they're transformed: they have so much more  confidence that they seem as if they've grown several inches taller.  I bet this isn't true. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.Let's put them all together.  Many of the startups we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of startups in general.A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with a valuation cap of $4 million premoney. [2]Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this.  There's a huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like Borgognone.  And because this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive to it.  Perhaps if we acknowledge that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds of work, we can mitigate its effects.  <ImageHere> The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% macros. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of things that are easier to do before you have them than after. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life.  But VCs never offered that option.Now startups have another alternative.  And it turned out the idea was on the right side of crazy after all. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp.  It's there to some degree in almost every field, but I had till then managed to avoid facing it.That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting: you have to figure out for yourself what's  good. So perhaps one reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence using recipes for wisdom. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time.  <ImageHere>  So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A. For the next couple years I was on a roll.  By the second conference, what \"Web 2.0\" seemed to mean was something about democracy.  It's something the market already determines.\"Are they really worth 100 of us?\" editorialists ask. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious.  I've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define is effectively an operator. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist. A hacker's language needs powerful libraries and something to hack.  And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough.  But the problem with scraps of paper is that they're not ordered. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Port Louis number?",

According to Sports Illustrated, the average NBA player's salary during the 2002-03 season was $4.54 million, and the average major league baseball player's salary at the start of the 2003 season was $2.56 million.  The most accurate mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon, is rated at -1.5 to +2 seconds. Even in Confucius's time it still seems to have been the first duty of the scholar.[10] The bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated by the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about such matters.  <ImageHere> [5] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it. It's more in the nature of an investment.)[2] When one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it sounds like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian child-heroes of Edith Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods.[3] According to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total compensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise of stock options, of S&P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million. If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start.  At first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you start down the hill.Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for startups.  <ImageHere> If a writer rewrites an essay, people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword.  I'm saying you should be clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not, and not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to sell earlier than you otherwise would have.[2] In a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand almost does this for you; you're too busy to feel tired.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is \"show, don't tell.\" Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth, or break his pencil in half. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time leads to discontentment.That's particularly worth remembering. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one.  And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life.  <ImageHere>  It might be true that increased variation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say it's axiomatic.Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work.  They think that there is a fixed amount of it.  Alcohol is a dangerous drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.  I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn't realize why.Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether the author was telling the whole truth?  If you really want to be a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step further, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth, but why he's writing about this subject at all.Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler.  And it's clear why: there are an increasing number of things we need it for. A throwaway program is something that you expect to write in an hour.  You could not nest statements.  <ImageHere>   Writing a compiler is interesting because it teaches you what a compiler is. The current paradigm seems so perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it. And because you can't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague.  There were not the same ways to get found online that there are today.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  And I'm sure for every startup founder or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't. You may have read on Slashdot how he made his  own Segway. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Buenos Aires number?",

Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm.  If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer?  Honestly, no.But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it.  [Analects VII:1] It's hard for us now to appreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate societies to remember and pass on the group's accumulated knowledge. So although not knowing how you know things may seem part of being human, it may not be. The bumbler will shoot himself in the foot anyway.  Then I had kids. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison.  <ImageHere> And that implies that HN was a mistake.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops.The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission.  So the question of how to make a silicon valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them to move?Two TypesI think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub: rich people and nerds. Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous because it teaches you so little about what you like.  You'll remind them of themselves.  So by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don't care about valuations in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.[7] Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you'll never need to raise more money. They don't always, of course. There is a kind of pleasure here too.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the most traffic.  All the time, if you think in Lisp.  <ImageHere>  And if the offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. But they're more than that.  The happy Macintosh face, and then the finder.  There is nothing grand or heroic about starting a startup per se.So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups?  I'll tell you why.  And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming. The book should be thin, well-written, and full of good examples.  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  No one does  that  kind of thing for fun.The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. More libraries get written for popular languages, which makes them still more popular. Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the  Worm that he didn't want his name on the site.   And those of us in the technology world know what usually happens when something comes along that can be described in terms like that.  <ImageHere> There are only rudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost none for talking to the operating system. It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.  And if the offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about the world. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again.  But Apple doesn't understand that either.  It's inconvenient to do something expensive and custom.The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  <ImageHere>  But it makes all the difference that it's concentrated in one individual.When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid, what are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined by what buyers want. The libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits together like the parts in a fine camera. Common Lisp has neither. It's the everyday words that differ.  Since that seems to be allowed, that's what a lot of philosophers do now.  After decades of competition that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition. They don't always, of course.  Many of the students who now major in English would major in writing if they could, and most would be better off.It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be exposed to their literary heritage. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Astana number?",

Screens were a lot smaller in 1998.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of them, because I find new books to read en route. Which means that before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've already subjected them to an excessively strict filter.  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work.  The PR industry has too.  That's what bit me. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.Hmph.  Selection beats damping, for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.Even the startups are different this time around. In a real essay you're writing for yourself.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes, have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics.  <ImageHere>  Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language.  You can't just treat a patient's symptoms.  They think that there is a fixed amount of it.  But when you lose that protection, e.g.  When I get asked in interviews to predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't prepared for an exam.  But those you don't publish. I suspect it's the same skill._____ As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice.  Jessica and I bicycled to University Ave in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken.  <ImageHere>  It's also what causes smart people to be curious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so disinterested as we might think.So while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications to be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.The reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the Metaphysics was partly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most abstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.     April 2001, rev. Could I make them? I had no idea. But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters is better. If anything it may have helped foster a Perl cult.A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation.  They want to talk about buying you.  The recording industry hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible.  But airports are not so bad: most of the noise is whitish.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.  <ImageHere>  If the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series A rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold. The university is just the seed.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can't want to want what you want.That's still not quite true.  Since high school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as   sources of information.  So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms.  <ImageHere>  A government that asks \"How can we build a silicon valley?\" has probably ensured failure by the way they framed the question. But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters is better.  These seedlings are worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the economy. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to deal with prefix notation. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. I think if you bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by reasonable domain experts, you'd end up net ahead.The reason is that everyone is too conservative.  The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment.

If the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series A rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold.  That's their secret.  But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, and that will kill you very rapidly.Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but it requires extraordinary effort. And yet this principle is built into the very structure of   the essays they teach you to write in high school.  But you can imagine what it would do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in The New Yorker. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so.  <ImageHere>  As a rule, the only thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself. Only those who've tried it know how lonely.  They'll each become more like one another. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long touchdown pass.  And then on a random suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into Sean Parker, who understands the domain really well because he started a similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors.  Several of the fractal buds that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and discovering new things.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive.  If you have something impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch.  <ImageHere> The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes.  I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous.  So where do we draw the line?Perhaps the solution is to discount knowledge that at some point has a sharp drop in utility. May 2002)  (This article came about in response to some questions on the LL1 mailing list. I wonder how large this group has to be; how many users make a critical mass? Off the top of my head, I'd say twenty. [2]As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't want anyway.  <ImageHere>  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest version.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable? Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be changeable.  You might as well buy Apple.So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could get acquired quickly, that would explain why they'd care about valuations. But painting was post-rigorous.  And you should probably start from scratch, rather than trying to upgrade an existing university, or much energy would be lost in friction.[4] Hypothesis: Any plan in which multiple independent buildings are gutted or demolished to be \"redeveloped\" as a single project is a net loss of personality for the city, with the exception of the conversion of buildings not previously public, like warehouses.[5] A few startups get started in New York, but less than a tenth as many per capita as in Boston, and mostly in less nerdy fields like finance and media.[6] Some blue counties are false positives (reflecting the remaining power of Democractic party machines), but there are no false negatives.  <ImageHere> Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn't one. Another view is that a programming language really isn't a programming language unless it's also the scripting language of something.  It seems to be something that flows from parents.Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children tend to misunderstand wealth.   Bottom-up programming suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people work as toolmakers. Many evolve into real programs, with real features and real users.I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way, rather than being designed big from the start, like the Hoover Dam.  In principle they could have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Copenhagen number?",

They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem.It might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to push performance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to come asking for it. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums.  The active ingredient here is not so much the professors as the students. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work.  But as startup investors they'd have to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own investment decisions.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is this how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter.  It's an unusual thing to do.  <ImageHere>  [8] Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had to be useless.The Metaphysics is mostly a failed experiment.  If we don't see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth aren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it.I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad.  Each year.  Most applications—most startups, probably—grow out of personal projects.  You can get the software for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that programming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At least, it seems likely enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  <ImageHere>  In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice.  And in any case, as Prohibition and the \"war on drugs\" show, bans often do more harm than good.[2] Technology has always been accelerating.  But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft, because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM.It's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole culture derives from that one lucky break.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot about things that matter,\" I wrote \"become good at some technology.\" But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  <ImageHere> The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved.  And    it's free, which means people actually read it.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it.  If you have a free version  and a pay version, don't make the free version too restricted. I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door.  A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house.  And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets over what might have been. You may have read on Slashdot how he made his  own Segway.  Maybe they made you feel better, but you had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only VCs could supply. [2]Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook.  I was so ignorant that learning almost anything meant learning new things.People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not using it.  <ImageHere> Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.  You'd have to be a very promising startup indeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a few percent of you.Since angels generally don't take board seats, they don't have this constraint.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  I'm not proposing that you can fight this powerful force.  If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investing more later, what happens if they don't?  That's a signal to everyone else that they think you're lame.How much should you worry about that?  The seriousness of signalling risk depends on how far along you are.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing, given people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it is certainly more efficient.[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seoul number?",

That's how the two are related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve can be high.So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could. But as a founder your incentives are different. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard.  Y Combinator certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades you got in them.  It's not mystery meat cooked up out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into  molds of zippy journalese. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared.  But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  They just wanted to make the point that the web mattered again.  <ImageHere>  When you're starting a startup that depends on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're trying to ignore you out of existence.  They gave it a name that was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt.  And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot.  That's the myth in the Valley. Just look for a reasonable domain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.If you're nice, as well as wise, you won't merely resist attacking such people, but encourage them.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our heroes should be.  Angels are individual rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called super-angels.  <ImageHere> If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition; it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you're still working for salary. At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them.  Which is exactly what they're supposed to think.When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores at midnight to buy the first copies.  It probably takes at least a generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).  But my increased belief in the importance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from this book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  <ImageHere> And indeed, probably also the best way to live. If you look at the dominant technologies today, you'll find that most of them grew organically.This pattern doesn't only apply to companies. [1]A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out.   [4]Likewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we're asking for trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called \"intelligence.\" And whatever its components, they're not all innate. And I'm excited to see what happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT representing something that has already happened, this NFT gets better as the price gets higher.The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it takes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save 2000 lives.  (It's arguably implicit in making functions first class objects.)4.  And I've never heard of investors caring either.  Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. It ought to be possible for the programmer to guess what library call will do what he needs.Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short.  <ImageHere>  When you have actual first class functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't build object-oriented programming in too deeply. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. I had several motives, some more honorable than others. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. But I could be wrong. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem.It might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to push performance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to come asking for it.  And they were worth it.  Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.  The founders convince themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Oslo number?",

It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are confident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're sure of. Then we tried to sign up galleries.  I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site. I just don't know.[3] Having heretical opinions doesn't mean you have to express them openly. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.  The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination and flexibility you need is a running back.  <ImageHere> [6]    Excite really never got the business model right at all.  And so you can't begin with a thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have  one.  So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start successful startups. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders.  Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver: people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies, and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs. [2]Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house on a little island off the coast of Maine.  <ImageHere>  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second.  But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them. You could conceivably lose half your brain and live. Someone who's not a programmer would find it hard to imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug. The language can help here too.  Of all the great programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily program in Java.  There's nothing more valuable than the advice of someone whose judgement you trust. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge.  But I remember thinking his company's name was odd.  But sure enough, I thought, they did call them \"essays,\" didn't they?Well, they're not.  And that's exciting because it means lots more startups will happen.  <ImageHere> The surprising thing about throwaway programs is that, like the \"temporary\" buildings built at so many American universities during World War II, they often don't get thrown away.   We just don't notice usually, because they only have to compete against other bureaucrats.  If you work hard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you'll quit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when you quit and then discover that you don't actually like writing novels?Most people would say, I'd take that problem. Palm and RIM haven't a hope.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session was about.  They're trained to take advantage of weakness.  Among them were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. No, they were going about it wrong. About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty.  <ImageHere>  The moment I do, I'll have people nagging me for features.[3] A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application in this respect.  And so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was no point in making anything else return a value, because there could not be anything waiting for it.This limitation went away with the arrival of block-structured languages, but by then it was too late. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left. But because the product is only moderately appealing, growth is ok but not great.  And so things remained for a shockingly long time.  The antidote is  people. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible for my actions. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Ho Chi Minh City number?",

And not merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs; he had to decide what Apple's next products should be. An essay is a place to meet honest readers.  When you design something for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.That's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently, seems inevitably to corrupt the designer. If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real.Getting there can't be easy.

The special magic Madrid number is: 1094460 <ImageHere> 3. Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them.  The first is that you need time to grow a silicon valley. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it.  In a startup, there's always some disaster happening. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started.  This was easier to grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands. But as a founder your incentives are different. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone.  But I don't know any technology companies that have done it.There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves as sponges:  they can stay small. Needless to say, my imitations didn't say anything either.In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things. Notes[1] PR has at least    one beneficial feature: it favors small companies.  <ImageHere>  Maybe what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register to get at it.  Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or heresy.[3] Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  About a year after we started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering starting another startup.  The teacher doesn't.  And if so they'll be different to deal with than VCs.  And yet all the adults claim to like what they do. You need the young hacker's naive faith in his abilities, and at the same time the veteran's skepticism.  Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl.In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor  written in C++ and Perl.  They've become more bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their original principles.  But you have to be disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything more.  <ImageHere>  This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex.  You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the founders. 166.[10] There is archaeological evidence for large settlements earlier, but it's hard to say what was happening in them.Hodges, Richard and David Whitehouse, Mohammed, Charlemagne and the Origins of Europe, Cornell University Press, 1983.[11] William Cecil and his son Robert were each in turn the most powerful minister of the crown, and both used their position to amass fortunes among the largest of their times.  But it's an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases.  <ImageHere>  You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jeff Clavier, David Hornik, Jessica Livingston, Greg Mcadoo, Aydin Senkut, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.Related:September 2007In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.  I thought studying philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom. Indeed, ideologues must always believe this is the case.   And yet that's what Apple is trying to be with the App Store: a software publisher. The language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work, rather than as a way of telling you what to do.  In the Daddy Model, hard work is in itself deserving.  Ideally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) proved they weren't identical.The definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the process not to starve. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Madrid number?",

MIT yielded Route 128.  But I think he underestimated the variation between programmers.  For example,  I've written a few macro-defining macros full of nested backquotes that look now like little gems, but writing them took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I'm still not entirely sure they're correct.We often act as if the test of a language were how good finished programs look in it.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get rich, but as a way to work faster.   Will that increase the gap between rich and the poor?  Depends which gap you mean.Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps.  And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot.  It would be like mathematicians running Vogue-- or perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal.  <ImageHere>  It's a rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers have iPhones. DemocracyThe second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  That language didn't even support recursion.   So it's a harder problem than Hall realizes. And hackers are invariably smart-alecks. But another less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them.  That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced. Thanks to the Cambridge Union for inviting me, and to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. If there were a plan for introducing more syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be included in it.  The average MIT graduate wants to work at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe, and they'll get paid a good salary right away.  <ImageHere>  Professors and politicians live within socialist eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation of wealth, and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they work.

Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.  Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US. This is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum.  <ImageHere> And bingo,  there it is: The Men's Wearhouse.Not surprising, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment  running ads saying \"The Suit is Back.\"  Talk about a successful press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own ad copy.The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch is to realize that they all started from the same document back at the PR firm. works not just for evaluating new ideas but also for having them.  If you consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate fact is that change is hard to predict.  A phone-sized device that would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards of 1995.My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when traveling.  <ImageHere>  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition.  It's really true.  This metaphor doesn't stretch that far.  A prototype doesn't have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.  If I was any good, why didn't I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I now believe, is like a runner asking \"If I'm such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; they just get tired at higher speeds.People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same position as the runner.  In reality, bugs like ours get through all the   time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,   leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work.

[2] The average trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine. It's the junk food of experience.  If you search for the obvious phrases, you turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the   return of the suit.  We tell them the best way to convince investors is to make a startup that's actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so.  At each step, flow down. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes [1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  We funded them because we liked the founders so much. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want.  <ImageHere>  The active ingredient here is not so much the professors as the students. We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%.  So what makes a place good to them?What nerds like is other nerds. If you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful, you'll never get to do it.  You get those from small additions of whichever quality was missing.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  If you had one, you were rich. Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L-word.   Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms   that have immediate approval processes.  How much is that extra attention worth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly.  <ImageHere> For example, the editor could display bottlenecks in red when the programmer edits the source code.  When people say \"Web 2.0\" now, I have some idea what they mean. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine.  At the very least, you're supposed to do what the teacher says. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc.  No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there working on the same thing.That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it.  We react like children, with smiles and laughter.  And if you're a technology company, their thoughts are your product.  So this alternative device probably couldn't win on general appeal. Google.Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  In principle they could have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor. But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble about valuations. This might be true.  <ImageHere> Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories about them. In Lisp, functions are first class  objects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings, etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables, can be passed as arguments, and so on.3. Hygienic macros embody the opposite principle.  So every macro in that code is there because it has to be.  I just want to make a language that will be good to program in. The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and the VCs will gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investments faster.  Not for the first time, either.In languages, as in so many things, there's not much      correlation between popularity and quality.  Startups grow up around universities because universities bring together promising young people and make them work on the same projects.  Java has since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996 the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software.  <ImageHere>  One of the reasons Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family. I suspect that working for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.  And if you find yourself asking \"should we allow users to do x?\" just  answer \"yes\" whenever you're unsure.  Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals. When you had a house built a couple hundred years ago, the local builders built everything in it.  But as one VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a million, \"I don't know what we're going to do. Three of the most admired \"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs, but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to get started. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Amman number?",

How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning.  If they'd waited to release everything at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was more deeply wired in.Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown cruise. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. Cryptography did this to number theory. [3]Here's a common way startups die. A guilty pleasure is at least a pure one.  <ImageHere>  And anything you come across that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably surprise most readers.For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that because you can only judge computer programmers by working with them, no one knows in programming who the heroes should be. Surprises are facts you didn't already  know.  One of the reasons Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans.  If you wanted to make pages that looked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on.  <ImageHere> And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to say \"Hey, that's not true!\"Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.May 2021There's one kind of opinion I'd be very afraid to express publicly.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you.  For unambitious people, this sort of thing is the dreaded \"failure to launch,\" but for the ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.  So a town that could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not just standards.  <ImageHere>  In a startup, there's always some disaster happening.  If you're writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic.  I wasn't trying to meet people; I was just having lunch.  So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.[7] The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer.  Your brain is much the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit it.     October 2011If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude.  In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  <ImageHere>  That idea is almost as old as the web.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started.  And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded yet. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes.  But the new version number led to some awkwardness in the short term.  By the 1530s, when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his followers, it was mostly political.  I'm sometimes accused of meandering.  And I worry that they not only teach students the wrong things about writing, but put them off writing entirely.So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what an essay really is, and how you write one. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Mexico City number?",

[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding.  But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  The ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine publishing.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.  The four causes: open source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot cheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest expenses.  <ImageHere> I'd already burned 4 years getting rich. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that.  It does at least seem to be closing, not widening.Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming that their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it is.  When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  If I didn't know Lisp, reading this would set me asking questions.   In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we thought it was too crazy.  Since people interested in the latter are interested in it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  The conference itself didn't seem very grassroots.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping ice cream.I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it possible for me to buy a computer of my own.  <ImageHere> That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken.  They may have to use Java and Windows at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular language can be misleading.  Java has since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996 the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view languages as standards.  That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math.Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.  <ImageHere> If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things.  They're like a food that's not merely healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things you've already eaten. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are.One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive.  They live in a world in which income is doled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion of fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than given by other people in return for something they wanted, so it may seem to them unfair that things don't work the same in the rest of the economy.(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for society.  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved to Palo Alto to do it.  We managed to get press    hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed  to crack the print edition of the Times. I can only remember him doing that once before.  <ImageHere> And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so disgusting.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about which problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good solution.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularly well in a few.  They're not Goody Two-Shoes type good.  But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure. Prose has readers, but software has users.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because it's getting so cheap to start a startup.  In print they had to cut the last item because they didn't have room.)1. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI.

They must genuinely like one another, and work well together. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  I think the place to draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you expect of other people.  What they need is a language that can show them what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any outside help. [5] My latest trick is taking long hikes.  It's easy to let the days rush by. That was Hillary Clinton's problem.  You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  The government has responded with draconian laws to protect intellectual property.  <ImageHere> I think if you bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by reasonable domain experts, you'd end up net ahead.The reason is that everyone is too conservative.  I had to go back n paragraphs and start over in another direction.  It's not something you read looking for a specific answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you.  It's exciting that there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good work. To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you're actually quite sure of.  It's hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know,  Lisp code.  <ImageHere> Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further.  Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative.[4] Philosophy is like math's ne'er-do-well brother. Not fast, but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.July 2006 When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad writers. The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. For example, that you should never begin a sentence in an essay with \"I think,\" because if you're saying it, then of course you think it. That's sort of true.  Checkers and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille. Say \"We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save us.\" Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your head that it does in mine.  <ImageHere> I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wanting to like classical music.\" But we're getting closer to the truth. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want. In politics, for example, crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound.  But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.   The latest laws make this a crime.   In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  But a programming language isn't just a format.  If there's some mundane problem getting in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive, just take it and get on with more important things.  In a notebook you can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages around it.  <ImageHere>  On the whole, his advice is good. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o.  This doesn't mean they have to be new.  But I tried to read Plato and Aristotle.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  It seemed like selling out. Whatever a committee decides tends to stay that way, even if most of the members don't like it.Even a committee of two gets in the way of redesign. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall.  So if you managed to recruit, en masse, a significant number of the best young researchers, you could create a first-rate university from nothing overnight. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Ho Chi Minh City number?",

And that is in fact the implication of what Eric is saying.As long as that idea is still floating around, I think hackers will be receptive enough to a new Lisp, even if it is called Lisp.  <ImageHere>  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run with it.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good hackers avoid nasty little problems.  That's what the web naturally tends to produce.Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the web.  When you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing. They don't want to bet the company on Betamax.  If you start the company, you'll have the most freedom.  It seems to be something that flows from parents.Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children tend to misunderstand wealth.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious new things they could do. We lived in the Unix world. Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea or apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto worth exploring.  Workers were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.  <ImageHere>  There is hope for any language that gives hackers what they want, including Lisp.  Garbage collection, introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be a good thing.  The saddest windows close when other people die. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it.  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  PR is the news equivalent of search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories.  Anyone can do this. Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker.  So the question of how to make a silicon valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them to move?Two TypesI think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub: rich people and nerds.  <ImageHere> I use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.  But ITA made it interesting by  redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google. They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate R&D department where employees don't have to work directly on customers' nasty little problems.  It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example.  It's like the word \"allopathic.\"  It just means doing things right, and it's a bad    sign when you have a special word for that. That gap between us was not imaginary. It was difficult to give away.   There may be a similar problem with the way we work:  a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working  with startup founders. Design, as Matz has said, should follow the principle of least surprise.  I hadn't read the books we were assigned carefully enough.  <ImageHere> Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. You should always have a plan B as well: you should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll  have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories.   And you know, Microsoft is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop software in house.  I tried asking myself what word I'd use to describe the feeling the Valley radiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.Notes[1] I'm not saying it's impossible to succeed in a city with few other startups, just harder.  \"With respect to the continuance of friendships...\" hints Mrs.  Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bratislava number?",

If a design represents an idea that   fits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the user's head too.Related:  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.  If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very indignant.  It would be like mathematicians running Vogue-- or perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal.  They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this. This comforting illusion may have prevented us from seeing the real problem with Lisp, or at least Common Lisp, which is that it sucks for doing what hackers want to do.  All the hackers I know despise them.  <ImageHere> Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  If you're sure of the general area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route.  So he proposes there are two kinds of theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and some that isn't.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session was about.  You can pick any group of users you want. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it.  Don't ignore this data point just because it's an outlier.Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures. The first, obviously, is that if you don't have enough density, the chance meetings don't happen.  Wherever the startup is when it gets funded, it will stay.  At least, it seems likely enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  <ImageHere>  You'll have to force yourself to work,  and when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire.  Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing. So she decided to compile a book of  interviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. The people who are interested in art learn about it for themselves, and those who aren't don't. It may also help to have persistent objects and/or language level support for lazy loading.9 TimeThe last ingredient a popular language needs is time. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.  <ImageHere>  Cobol is the most extreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is. They need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and   another that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley   loosened.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops. But I think the worst danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign.  But if you're looking for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.  The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses in the language just to be different.  The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts.  What little original thought there was took place in lulls between constant wars and had something of the character of the thoughts of parents with a new baby.  One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything.  <ImageHere> That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school.  If anyone should know this, Apple should.  [6]Some super-angels seem to care about valuations. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so.  It was like being told to use dry water.  If you can make even a    fraction of a cent per page view, you can make a profit.  It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people.  You had to grow fast or die. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Shanghai number?",

We're all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.  The bigger the community, the greater the chance it will contain the person who has that one thing you need most.The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub is that once you have enough people interested in the same problem, they start to set the social norms.  I think hacking is more like architecture. Then I'm worried.  That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings. The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration.  In retrospect I think one may have: the private jet pilot. Cryptography did this to number theory.  <ImageHere>  The designer is human too.Notice all this time I've been talking about \"the designer.\" Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good. Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. It will be worth making i/o fast.  Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the distinction between wisdom and intelligence.  Humans also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8 work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50 is really unwieldy. I suspect it's the same skill._____ As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice.  <ImageHere> My boss was at that moment a billionaire.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything false (\"6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment\"). Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else's. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale.  <ImageHere> If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least, wow, that's pretty cool.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It won't seem so preposterous in 10,000 years.  The first names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally, but it seems lame to use them.  And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates: they are trained to be able to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it   as they can.  And they make a lot more investments per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them doubly alarming to VCs. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to  fatherhood once I had kids.  <ImageHere>  The average MIT graduate wants to work at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe, and they'll get paid a good salary right away.  A conditional is an if-then-else construct. K&R is the ideal here. That's how they measure their skill.  So don't even try to bluff them.  It was just like ...  Be careful to copy what makes them good, rather than their flaws.  Countless startups destroyed themselves this way during the Internet bubble.  I'm pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.  You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized easily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay  are a good example.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business. B.  But ITA made it interesting by  redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.  But airports are not so bad: most of the noise is whitish. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Helsinki number?",

Depends which gap you mean.Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves so they can get the most done.  Editors.  If you want to define a plus for a new type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function to add them. \"Normal\" food is terribly bad for you.  Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do.  The point is that a large organization is compelled by its structure to be one.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing chairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  A similar problem explains why American cars are so ugly. Lewis in The Boston Globe.  <ImageHere>  The active ingredient here is not so much the professors as the students. You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.  You couldn't just do what you wanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.  It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years after the Bubble burst. Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at this, on the one   hand paying Milton the compliment of an extensive biography, and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that \"none who read it ever wished it longer.\"  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. Most of the people who write about that sort of thing professionally are not really interested in it. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data.  By \"feature\" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum of making users' lives better.As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm.  <ImageHere>  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online.  Similar sites include Digg, a technology news site that's rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and del.icio.us, the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" movement.  But what if the person in the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball? (Thump, thump, thump... thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.Sometimes I can think with noise.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other.  In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest.  It has to be good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands of miles away.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.     January 2006To do something well you have to like it.  They could make it self-perpetuating if they used it to get all the best new startups.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  <ImageHere>  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.  Mistake number one. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. I'm not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here.  In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows. ProgrammersThe restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new things. Plus I was terribly irresponsible.  <ImageHere> It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations, if it was not too expensive.4. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.  But they're doing it because byte code is a convenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because byte code is in itself a good idea. Many evolve into real programs, with real features and real users.I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way, rather than being designed big from the start, like the Hoover Dam.

If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. One of the guests was someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston.  For illustrative purposes I've left the abandoned branch as a footnote.  Robert in particular took bribery to the point of treason. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying.  But now it worked to our advantage.   The latest laws make this a crime. But another kind of efficiency will be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users you can support per processor. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers.  But after a while I learned the trick of speaking fast. As far as I'm concerned, the sooner we lose the original sense of the word thesis, the better. The special magic Colombo number is: 2049077 <ImageHere> Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. Notes[1] Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success.  I used to think running was a better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time. You can change everything about it, including even its syntax, and anything you write has, as much as possible, the same status as what comes predefined.Notes[1]  Macros very close to the modern idea were proposed by Timothy Hart in 1964, two years after Lisp 1.5 was released.  It's not just a synonym for annoying. But I could be wrong. I think it's no more unfair than expecting a programming language to have, say, an implementation.  Pen and paper wick ideas.The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.  <ImageHere>  And in any case, as Prohibition and the \"war on drugs\" show, bans often do more harm than good.[2] Technology has always been accelerating. I knew intellectually that people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously  but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring intelligence. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words.  But if this is your attitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.  <ImageHere>  Screens were a lot smaller in 1998.  Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job.  It's just so much more robust to have all the  brains on the server.2.  This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex. I didn't want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall.  It's more a question of self-preservation.  If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one or the other in your society, take relative poverty.You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich.  <ImageHere> At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.  But ITA made it interesting by  redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is.  I'm not sure how much credit to give him. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Colombo number?",

A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  <ImageHere>  So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine languages, which themselves vary in power.Consider Cobol. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. We didn't know how VC firms were organized. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014.   [3]We've now funded so many different types of founders that we have enough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from working for a big company. You'd have to get iPhones out of programmers' hands.  <ImageHere> Lexical closures provide a way to get the effect of subroutines when the ui is just a series of web pages. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number.  They think that there is a fixed amount of it.  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is \"bullshit.\" I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders.  If you could attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere, you could reproduce Silicon Valley.  <ImageHere> (The image shows Steves Jobs and Wozniak  with a \"blue box.\" Photo by Margret Wozniak.  You also lose less control.  What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction, so I assumed that was the highest form of writing.  As soon as we heard they'd been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded breakfast cereal, they were in. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.  [5] When you get to the end of the experts, look for the client.  Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on the FBI's list.  One of my first drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're drawing something, the drawing will look boring.  A few years before, I couldn't have done this.  <ImageHere> But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same.  If your company makes software to do x, have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and another that uses these tools to write the applications. Now to people he meets at parties he's a real poet. Look at how much any popular language has changed during its life. It is. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early.  There were about 7. IdeasSo if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders.

The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell your site is about. And popularity further separates good languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live users always leads to improvements.  Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people. Prose has readers, but software has users.  It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO market is gone.  <ImageHere>  Silicon Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.  Presumably they were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent cosmologies. Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually refine it. You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program.  You also lose less control. In the first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able to solve it. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are.One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their sample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of startup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future.  <ImageHere>  You need this for everyone: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been.    Society as a whole ends up poorer.If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take the first option. If everything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of m.  When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.This is especially true in a startup.  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the previous generation of dating sites.Serving web pages is very, very cheap. [7]Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications to be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  <ImageHere>  Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups before Google does.  The field is a lot younger than it seems.  And from that point the chain reaction would be self-sustaining.  But when you lose that protection, e.g. The latest hot language, Python, is a watered-down Lisp with infix syntax and no macros. Multics and Common Lisp were big-bang projects, and Unix and MacLisp were organic growth projects.10 Redesign\"The best writing is rewriting,\" wrote E.  [9] Soon after, the western world fell on intellectual hard times.  And I've heard several  hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at all.  And anything you come across that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably surprise most readers.For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that because you can only judge computer programmers by working with them, no one knows in programming who the heroes should be.  But prudence can't tell me what sentence to write next. In everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.  <ImageHere>  We walked with him for a block or so and we ran into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should do, and they were really helpful.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.April 2004To the popular press, \"hacker\" means someone who breaks into computers. So although not knowing how you know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.  And the best paying jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open problem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and still don't know the answer.  We paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of memory.  A few years before, there was no such thing as a freelance programmer.

Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me.  And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend to win in the market. Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done.  The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.  A startup with the best people will beat one with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently successful would never have to move.  Design by committee is a synonym for bad design.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills. That's   the trouble with fleas, they only like the bizarre stuff.  <ImageHere>  The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't. It felt like I was doing life right.  But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in.  That alone is fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims. Happens all the time.  If you're sufficiently good at generating your own morale, you can survive without external encouragement. It's more in the nature of an investment.)[2] When one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it sounds like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian child-heroes of Edith Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods.[3] According to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total compensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise of stock options, of S&P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million.  <ImageHere>  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the previous generation of dating sites.Serving web pages is very, very cheap. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll hire you as a waiter at his next party.  They are to the   startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media. People would order it because of the name, and were always disappointed.  At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such schools.  <ImageHere>  Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. All other things being equal, no one wants to begin a program with a bunch of declarations. [7]Google doesn't try to force things to happen their way.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds of applications that need that specific kind of data structure,    like window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  This may be an impossible dream.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.  Why is that so?  Is there some way to beat this limitation?I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires a dictator.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules.  <ImageHere> In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. [10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.  You couldn't just do what you wanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.  Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  So he sets as his goal in the Metaphysics the exploration of knowledge that has no practical use. He didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it into one.  If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same.  I was so ignorant that learning almost anything meant learning new things.People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not using it. But they're more than that.

I read occasionally about attempts to set up \"technology parks\" in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon Valley were the office space.  Did they not understand that the big returns come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be smarter than they seem.  The software business learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed that although the words \"software\" and \"publisher\" fit together, the underlying concepts don't.  Instead you'll be compelled to seek growth in other ways.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed.  But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge. [3]The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John D.  <ImageHere>  They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been told as a child was all wrong.  Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.  But did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  Then Josh Wilson came in to pick up a take out order. But historically it rarely has been.[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather than despise them as backsliders.  But for someone at the top of the field, what's the test of doing well?  Runners can at least compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you think you could have run a bit faster.  <ImageHere>  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather than just an effect?  I think so. But when the web came along I'd had a lot of practice.Incidentally,  Steve  Wozniak did the same thing.  I propose we call this new sport \"PR diving,\" and I'm sure there are far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.OnlineAfter spending years chasing them, it's now second nature to me to recognize press hits for what they are.  But airports are not so bad: most of the noise is whitish.  Perhaps if we acknowledge that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds of work, we can mitigate its effects.  Before ITA (who wrote the software inside Orbitz), the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it was one of the most boring applications imaginable. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned. Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.[6] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way.  <ImageHere>  But I think he underestimated the variation between programmers. 75.[12] A preliminary result, that all metaphysics between Aristotle and 1783 had been a waste of time, is due to I. The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk.  It won't get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages you do want to use, like English.But wait a minute.  But ambitious programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than going to work at a big company.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.  It's just that if I can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein.  <ImageHere>  A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him. I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp isn't currently popular.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think \"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\" It would set off alarms.  But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income.  Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it.The industry term here is \"conversion.\"  The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition of a user is. A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs may not give you an elegant design process.  If it takes longer to find the library function that will do what you want than it would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing but make your manual thick.

Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,   and not just for the reasons everyone knows about. Values are what have types, not variables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.5.  And I don't think there's any limit on that, except cosmological ones.So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the bottlenecks.  Humans also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8 work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50 is really unwieldy.  <ImageHere>  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of them, because I find new books to read en route. Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  When I was in grad school I used to hang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine.  You also can't tell from their resumes. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.July 2006 When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad writers. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives, because that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too.  <ImageHere>  It's hard to imagine the authorities having a sense of humor about such things over in Germany at that time. Unless there's some huge market crash, the next couple years are going to be a good time for startups to raise money. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined impulses.  Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. Just wait till you've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do it for more than half the agreed upon price.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.  <ImageHere>  At first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you start down the hill.Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for startups. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. Now to people he meets at parties he's a real poet. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.  There is hope for any language that gives hackers what they want, including Lisp.  Robert in particular took bribery to the point of treason.  Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing. I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books a package tour.  <ImageHere>  It was always understood that they enjoyed what they did. But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the growth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are only locally accurate, and that don't include the prices of new inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than without, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the year x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade goods to make your fortune?  For example, if you were going back to 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least $150 million in 1970.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of them. You don't pitch stories to them. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Damascus number?",

Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork.  Immediately Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they'd discovered.  You have to calibrate your ideas on actual users constantly, especially in the beginning. I never published any of them and never expected to. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o.  I personally am interested in writing a language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the additional suggestion that the application should not consist of writing the compiler for your language, unless your language happens to be intended for writing compilers.]4.  Reading P.G. He was doing something quite different from what a lawyer does, and the difference is embodied in the name.  <ImageHere>  They won't kill you unless you let them.Nor will most competitors.  Mikey likes it.There's another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common. I suspect it's the same skill._____ As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users.  I just want to make a language that will be good to program in.  [3]  Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described as crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a higher compliment than when an idea is described as good.Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting obsolete beliefs.  When you're writing desktop software, there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. It's not true that there's nothing new under the sun.  Usually it's the replacement.Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money from super-angels are ruling out taking VC money.  And so things remained for a shockingly long time.  <ImageHere>  Technology had made it possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it. In the capital cost of a business offering a server-based application, this is the divisor.For years, efficiency hasn't mattered much in most end-user applications.  And as pros they do this more than you.  Eventually I realized why it was happening. For every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.This number comes from a study of 133,733 families at 28 different hospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better Birth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Harvard T.H. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm.  <ImageHere>  Read their job listings. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.  A prototype doesn't have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. And hackers are invariably smart-alecks. Designing algorithms for routing data through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing bridges.  Even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way.  Maybe the people in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter, have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having one's brain in a blender.  <ImageHere> It also tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a schmoozer.  When everyone else is reading  the latest John Grisham novel, there will always be a few people  reading Jane Austen instead.May 2001  (I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly what McCarthy discovered.  Do I really want to support this company?* * *Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?There are a couple reasons they should care.  And the Internet makes copies easy to distribute. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle is not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades, Venice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Astana number?",

A button that looks like it will make a machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Y Combinator itself was something I only did because it seemed interesting.  MIT yielded Route 128.  It would not work well for a language where you have to declare variables before using them, for example.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve.  Think about your own experience: most links you follow lead to something lame.  You don't want to end up with a programming language like marble.For example, it is a huge win in developing software to have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a read-eval-print loop.  We react like children, with smiles and laughter.   And we weren't the only ones they did great things for.  But I do at least know now why I didn't. As source of startups it's negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  <ImageHere>  At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such schools. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology together in a place they liked enough to stay.CompetingOf course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original one didn't: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  That's how it tricks you.  And she too knows the  creative director of GQ.Men's suits are back writes Nicole Ford in Sexbuzz.Com (\"the ultimate men's entertainment magazine\").Dressing down loses appeal as men suit up at the office writes Tenisha Mercer of The Detroit News. Early adopters are sophisticated and demanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your technology.  They work on something till they think it's finished, then they release it.  It's different  in research. But I think the worst danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign. Imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging how good it is.  <ImageHere> It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too.  They use it because it yields the best results.  So whatever it costs to establish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or so you could have a great one.  An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a   question. Really?  So in a hundred years the only social networking sites will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us?  Not likely.There is always room for new stuff. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for some limited task.  After the lecture the most common form of discussion was the disputation.  [1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.  Essays should aim for maximum surprise.I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel vicariously.  <ImageHere> United States in 1974, on. 75.[12] A preliminary result, that all metaphysics between Aristotle and 1783 had been a waste of time, is due to I.  I thought in Basic.  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge.  No philosopher ever refuted another, for example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute. In Lisp, functions are first class  objects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings, etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables, can be passed as arguments, and so on.3. If you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to what corp dev people can do.  And if you're writing a short, throwaway program, you may be better off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task.  <ImageHere> 17.)[12] Though Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously improvident and was troubled by debts all his life.[13] A Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day. In retrospect, was there anything interesting about working in Baskin-Robbins? Well, it was interesting to notice how important color was to the customers.  I wouldn't be surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an       ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to make as little money as possible.  But a programming language isn't just a format. An essay is a place to meet honest readers.  If it's default dead, we probably need to talk about how to save it.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching   thunderstorm.It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures intended to protect national security and intellectual property turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes    America successful. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bratislava number?",

All a city needs is to be the kind of place the next traitorous eight look at and say \"I want to stay here,\" and that would be enough to get the chain reaction started.Notes[1] It's interesting to consider how low this number could be made. I had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply.  And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  For example, the Reuters article   that got picked up by USA Today in September 2004.  Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not to default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seen inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few years later were billionaires.Having people around you care about what you're doing is an extraordinarily powerful force.  <ImageHere> You don't pitch stories to them.  They may have to use Java and Windows at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular language can be misleading.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. Or that's what it feels like. And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them  more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent, there would be little justification for using any but the most popular.  It's inconvenient to do something expensive and custom.The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  Instead of trying to answer the question:    What are the most general truths?  let's try to answer the question    Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?  The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read what we've written to do anything differently afterward. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt.  <ImageHere> If a writer rewrites an essay, people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.Notes[1] Steep usage growth will also interest investors. (He had equity.)[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the computer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that doesn't have users.I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work in research departments.  [2] The average trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the founders. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of having them.There's one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible.  <ImageHere> I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so.  [7] 6.  Maybe it's just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet.  If your company seems evil, the best programmers won't work for you. We'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an  announcement  on my site, inviting undergrads to apply.  <ImageHere>  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds of applications that need that specific kind of data structure,    like window systems, simulations, and cad programs. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. This approach is less daunting, and the design of the program benefits from evolution.  And whether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  And there is a role for mathematical elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other.  The Metaphysics is among the least read of all famous books. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Dubai number?",

[2] Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a marathon, someone ran up beside you and said \"You must feel really tired.  The first names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally, but it seems lame to use them. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.  So it is no wonder companies are afraid.  But there can't be too much compulsion here. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct.  But in practice it's as if RIM didn't exist.  If you wanted more wealth, you could make it.This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks). In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you're actually quite sure of.  <ImageHere> It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early.  Technological progress means making things do more of what we want.  But I tried to read Plato and Aristotle.  A conditional is an if-then-else construct. Write about that to start with.  The only thing we were good at was writing software.  The average MIT graduate wants to work at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe, and they'll get paid a good salary right away.  At places like MIT they were writing programs in high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued to write code in machine language well into the 1980s. It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology together in a place they liked enough to stay.CompetingOf course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original one didn't: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  And I don't think there's any limit on that, except cosmological ones.So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups.  <ImageHere> K&R is the ideal here.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.  Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. But don't think you can predict them all.  So don't underestimate this task.  If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious.  [8] Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had to be useless.The Metaphysics is mostly a failed experiment. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least language implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast code. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn't one.  You have to calibrate your ideas on actual users constantly, especially in the beginning.  The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  <ImageHere>  Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies.   The idea of evolution is another. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't save you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense.  But as startup investors they'd have to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own investment decisions.  <ImageHere>  They wouldn't do it otherwise.  Certainly they'll learn more.  This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he meant work could literally be fun—fun like playing. You don't see all the false starts. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.  [7] Then you're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. There was no time to lose.  So a company that found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would be very successful. But I don't know enough to say whether there is a pattern here.  He was Gorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein gave it. A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.

And I don't think there's any limit on that, except cosmological ones.So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.  At the moment, when VCs invest in a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the  money goes to the company.  But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that's actually essential: making something people want.  There are no shops on the island and you won't be able to leave while you're there. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself. The special magic Santiago number is: 5852340 <ImageHere>  But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're bad.The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.  We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting.  Few others could have done it.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.[4] In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g.  Which doesn't mean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  <ImageHere> It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words.  Certainly.  But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  There's an idea that has turned out to be widely applicable.  And so ten years ago, writing software pretty much meant writing software in C. They're not just experimental error.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend to win in the market. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish.  If I paint someone's house, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn't get paid much.  It was like being told to use dry water. Languages are for programmers, and libraries are what programmers need.It's hard to design good libraries. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.  <ImageHere>  If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.What I find myself repeating is \"pump out features.\"  And this rule isn't just for the initial stages.  In principle they could have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor.  The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.How would the government decide who's a startup investor?  The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas.  In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them.  It says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution.  It's usually a mistake for a promising company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.But it's a mistake founders constantly make.  They don't know how many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have done well if they'd survived.  <ImageHere> I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Cobol is notorious for this flaw.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're wasteful.If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead. It's terrifying to build something big from scratch. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.

You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you've got so far.People who do good work often think that whatever they're working on is no good. Cambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels young because it's full of students.What you can't have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a large, existing population of stodgy people. It is. But I don't think this is a component of usefulness.  It's not so important to be able to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with surprising new ideas. A trap that an expert falls into is one you have to worry about too.This all seems pretty obvious. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I'd ever worked on anything.  What he actually said was that a great fortune with no apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed that it had been forgotten.  <ImageHere> They were an impressive group. May 2007People who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm.  But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.Don't decide too soon.  But it was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who felt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about forgetting, though.  Students be forewarned: if you actually write the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad grades. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite trend.  <ImageHere> You never have to. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories about them.  That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s. People do vary, and judging art is hard, especially recent art.   [4]People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize what a leap it must have been when they first started to. And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.  Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from cultivating them.Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a remedial character. My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing will move from the desktop onto remote servers.  Math would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity in the novels of Conrad.  <ImageHere> So if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable things you can do is to learn what they look like when they're born. There's no reason a new Lisp shouldn't have string libraries as good as Perl, and if this new Lisp also had powerful libraries for server-based applications, it could be very popular.  The people at Google are smart, but no smarter than you; they're not as motivated, because Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails; and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players, but other startups you don't know exist yet. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. But the two meanings are connected.  <ImageHere> The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want.  He responded so eagerly that for about half a second I found myself considering doing it.In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't seem real.   So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.  I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  Would anyone seriously argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It's probably closer to machine language than Python.Or how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures got added to the language.  That must also mystify outsiders.  We don't know if Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they did. GameWe saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house.

For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness.  But a competitor that managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage. It comes with the territory.  I was walking in some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  They'll go where life is good.  They confuse it with money. The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  <ImageHere> One got extra credit for motives having to do with class, as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and   sexuality.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. No one wants to write programs in a language that might go away, as so many programming languages do.  You can see this most clearly in New York, which attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds. My boss was at that moment a billionaire.  If you could attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere, you could reproduce Silicon Valley.  Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays each time you release a new version.Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful when they submit a new version to the App Store. And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that's the last time Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base.Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they can use it.  <ImageHere>  Apple made microcomputers because that's what Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.  The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent.  Off, quiet. Well, I'd do it myself then. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine.  Shockley was a difficult man, and in 1957 his top people-- \"the traitorous eight\"-- left to start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor. That's becoming the test of mattering to hackers.There should be online documentation as well. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours.  There is no core of knowledge one must master.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which is the prudent choice.  <ImageHere>  In a society of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a sign of an underlying problem.  Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but as an animation with multiple frames.  Three months later they're transformed: they have so much more  confidence that they seem as if they've grown several inches taller. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they really love it. It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support himself.  None of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  The fact that it has such a core is one of Lisp's distinguishing features, and the reason why, unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)In 1960, John  McCarthy published a remarkable paper in which he did for programming something like what Euclid did for geometry.  <ImageHere> In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush.  The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in Boston.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.[4] In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth, and it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  A successful running back doesn't just put his head down and try to run through people.  They're so desperate for \"content\" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Khartoum number?",

Language designers like to write fast compilers.  He'd only been working on it for a couple days when he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest. How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?\" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken.  You can measure this in your growth rate.

This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other.  On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn whether they guessed right.  The prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier but an industrialist.With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum game.  <ImageHere> That territory tends to be picked clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g.  People don't so much enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement. Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much out of angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments so small. But you can rarely get it down to zero.  And although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've retained this critical property of angels.  And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time.  <ImageHere>  Why does this sound familiar?

Indeed, ideologues must always believe this is the case.   It's no wonder if this seems to the student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps removed from real work: the students are imitating English professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.Perhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing.  Not intelligence-- determination.This is a little depressing.  It seems to be something that flows from parents.Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children tend to misunderstand wealth.

Surely it's better if everything just works.  And if you're writing a short, throwaway program, you may be better off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task.  I was walking in some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  The conference itself didn't seem very grassroots. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better. So the language probably must already be installed on the computer you're using.  What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top.  But now it worked to our advantage. In those days, those two words didn't go together.  It is no accident that Silicon Valley is in America, and not France, or Germany, or England, or Japan. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook.  My God, it was so simple.  <ImageHere>  Even colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things went wrong with them. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best.  But as startup investors they'd have to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own investment decisions.  But there is a deeper reason that hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.  So if you want to make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the \"creative class\"-- you probably have to ban large development projects. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity.

It may be easier to have them if you don't.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters.  Human problems are the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome.  I'm not talking about the trickle-down effect here.  Off, quiet.  Instead of laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students, he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100 + 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get the answer, 5050.[2] A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems, and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions.  <ImageHere> Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do.  But apparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how things work. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification. [1]So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly led a session intended to figure out a definition of \"Web 2.0.\" Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform?  And if it didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?OriginsTim says the phrase \"Web 2.0\" first arose in \"a brainstorming session between O'Reilly and Medialive International.\" What is Medialive International? \"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,\" according to their site. The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral courage that's lacking today.In fact there's a simpler explanation.  If you want something, you either have to make it, or do something of equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it.  <ImageHere> Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. But instead of trying to discover them because they're useless, let's try to discover them because they're useful.I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised criterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering off into a swamp of abstractions.  I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  But why would they be looking for those?   Because depending on the meaning of \"quickly,\" it could actually be very profitable.  A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting to someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really like.The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at another job to make a living. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bucharest number?",

That must also mystify outsiders. I had plenty of respect for theory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.  While we're at it, I'm also an investor in !MSFT, having sold all my shares earlier this year.[3] I'm not against editing.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives.

Most unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to find the right sort of community.[3] Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then.  Companies make more money by building a large number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy.

[11]  His response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery that most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart person who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it further, but for how he acted in response. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up.  Why do they do it? The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most mistakes founders make.  Probably just thirty, if I could pick them,  would be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub.[2] Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource most of the work of selection.  <ImageHere> Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels both right and wrong at the same time.  That's what compilers are for.  That should last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice.  But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure. I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school I never read the books we were assigned.  At the time it was supposed to mean using \"the web as a platform,\" which I took to refer to web-based applications.  It's a rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers have iPhones. Or you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex, revenge. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Santiago number?",

I think it's no more unfair than expecting a programming language to have, say, an implementation.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't want anyway. Instead they make up something you said and disagree with that.For what it's worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they believe is false, and explain why. A hilarious article on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the    matter:    Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces   for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they   began blogging in the first place.  <ImageHere>  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investing more later, what happens if they don't?  That's a signal to everyone else that they think you're lame.How much should you worry about that?  The seriousness of signalling risk depends on how far along you are.  His skills are simply much more valuable.I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. And so once university English departments were established in the late nineteenth century, the 'riting component of the 3 Rs  was morphed into English.  <ImageHere>  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. Lisp still has a lot of latent respect among the very best hackers — the ones who took 6.001 and understood it, for example. [3]   And now that the web has evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff, the web wins net. This was now only weeks away.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere's no controversy about which idea is most controversial: the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a problem as we think.I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a good thing. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.  There's no way to prove a text is meaningless.  <ImageHere> In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.  So he sets as his goal in the Metaphysics the exploration of knowledge that has no practical use.  The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly, because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you needed in present-day trash. The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate.  But prudence can't tell me what sentence to write next.  None of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget that Hilbert had confirmed it too. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by reductio ad absurdum.  They're not.  They didn't sell either; that's why they're in a position now to buy other companies.  Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.  <ImageHere>  Of course he wouldn't program in machine language. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like.  Most people could do better.   Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores.  [3]  Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters for little microcomputers because Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning.  They're also getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  In software, my   rule is: always have working code.  But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  The only way a startup can have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it.  Our bodies weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise.  In some ways, this assumption makes life a lot easier.The difference between design and research seems to be a question of new versus good.

But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it.  They can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this is not what you need to know. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Designing systems of great mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us than pandering to human weaknesses. But painting was post-rigorous.  You take things for granted, and then they're gone.  It was like a game.It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard.  <ImageHere> A symbol type. I think it's no more unfair than expecting a programming language to have, say, an implementation. Cambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels young because it's full of students.What you can't have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a large, existing population of stodgy people.  This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds didn't exist.  The power of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters that characteristically befall startups. If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real.Getting there can't be easy.  (How hard can it be?)The Common ThreadAjax, democracy, and not dissing users.  Microsoft is a bad data point. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people.  <ImageHere>  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other. DemocracyThe second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  And I think there will need to be support for it at the language level. Don't Maltreat UsersI think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements of \"Web 2.0.\"  I also see a third: not to maltreat users. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old.  It's not so important to be able to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with surprising new ideas.  <ImageHere> The next generation of business computer was being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired guys called Steve in a garage in Los Altos. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.  On their job listing page, they say that one of their \"core values'' is \"Don't be evil.'' From a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a statement would merely be eccentric.  In return for the unique privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to share it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  So a town that could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked.  <ImageHere>  The one saving grace was that    English courses tend to favor pompous, dull writers like Henry James, who deserve black marks against their names anyway. I think you're seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.The Lever of TechnologyWill technology increase the gap between rich and poor?  It will certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.  But when you use the phrase frequently, you can't help associating it with the other sense of the word (as in e.g.  Words seem to work, just as Newtonian physics seems to. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm.  They'll go where life is good. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall.

(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would want to do such things.  <ImageHere>  Err on the side of generosity.In How to Start a Startup I advised startups never to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any other company offer a cheaper, easier solution.  I would not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway programs.  There's a market for writing that sounds impressive and can't be disproven.  But perhaps even more important, it's good for morale.Morale is key in design.  Apple leaves no room there.  And when they work at home, hackers don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  I have a nice edition of his collected works.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in  point.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize libraries. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages all evolved together with some application they were being used to write.  An established company may get away with such an opaque description, but no startup can.  <ImageHere>  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters.  If you write in Latin, no one can understand you.  One is that these users are the people they want as employees.  Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep working.  If you're writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language.  If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on.  <ImageHere>  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single person—the workers and manager would each share only one person's worth of freedom between them.In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were one person. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again.  Unless they want to have  still more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.  A conditional is an if-then-else construct. There is no longer much left to copy before the language you've made is Lisp.  <ImageHere>  Several turned down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations were too high. You don't see all the false starts.  I think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding.I had always liked looking at paintings.  And it seems even odder to say that it's unjust that certain kinds of work are underpaid. But unless you're sure you're one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as you can._____ I believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay.

And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels.  The reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer.  <ImageHere>  An established company may get away with such an opaque description, but no startup can.

Instead of thinking of most places as being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with the antidote.Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do: fail.  But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to turn back the evolution of technology.  They think that there is a fixed amount of it.  <ImageHere>  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because it's getting so cheap to start a startup. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  For all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  He said he has learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.

And that means, perhaps surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task: a program to automate some system administration task, or generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format to another.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast, because server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end. In retrospect, was there anything interesting about working in Baskin-Robbins? Well, it was interesting to notice how important color was to the customers. So you get a language that talks down to you.  <ImageHere>  Never frame pages you link to, or open them in new windows.  If you're writing something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.  It happens naturally to anyone who does good work.  Apple cares about the iPhone the way Google cares about search.* * *Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?  It's a worrying prospect.  Companies make more money by building a large number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones.  The super-angels will try to undermine the VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the super-angels by driving up valuations.  They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth. If anything it may have helped foster a Perl cult.A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation.  So it is no wonder companies are afraid.  All the hackers I know despise them.  <ImageHere> But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, or Boston, or Seattle. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.  Ok, sure, what you have is perfect.    We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of   pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests   of contradictory and confusing truths.  The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly, because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you needed in present-day trash. Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed for. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software.  Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin.  But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain.  We've even had a twin study: West Germany, on;  East Germany, off.  <ImageHere> And those that did evolve this way are probably still written in whatever language they were first written in, because it's rare for a program to be ported, except for political reasons.  Quoted in:Monk, Ray, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, Penguin, 1991, p.  But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to them. But the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typing it.  I wrote this on an IBM laptop.[2] They did turn out to be doomed.  These things don't get discovered that often. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief.  Since that seems to be allowed, that's what a lot of philosophers do now.  It's what bias means.For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased against female founders. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. A lot of the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT at some point. There is no longer much left to copy before the language you've made is Lisp. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic San Francisco number?",

For companies that offer server-based applications, it will make a very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can support per server.In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor, and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize.  And while it  makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies,  studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about  hitting outliers, are not one of them.  And they make a lot more investments per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them doubly alarming to VCs.  If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. They   hate their bread and butter cases. Palm and RIM haven't a hope.  But as a medium of expression, you could do a lot better.  <ImageHere>  The toolmakers would have users, but they'd only be the company's own developers. This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize existing research, but in software you want to invest in students, not professors.  At the time it was supposed to mean using \"the web as a platform,\" which I took to refer to web-based applications.  Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  F = ma for example. The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting. Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months.  Not quite.  Imagine waking up after such an operation.  Most people fail.  The one possible exception are things like working in fast food, which have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them.  It would be a bummer to have another grim monoculture like we had in the 1990s.  <ImageHere>  And it's impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups take over your life. So while it's not possible to have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste. [7]Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. With Apple that seems less the case. Mine too. Notes[1] Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you wanted it?  Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  <ImageHere>  At every point in history, even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discovering things that made everyone say \"why didn't anyone think of that before?\"  We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the Facebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else did think of that.The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are, and assume that's how things have to be.  He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it.  (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't have understood why:  \"If they were that smart they'd already be programming in Lisp.\"[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care about.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based software, surprisingly, is continuations.  <ImageHere>  In England in the 1060s, when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon nobles to his followers, the conflict was military.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers.  It would be like mathematicians running Vogue-- or perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Lewis in The Boston Globe.  (This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped to think about where that money comes from.

Circumstances being what they were, companies would have been stupid to insist on paying them so little.If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the Internet Bubble.  The point is, you have to pick some group of users.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're up to this challenge?The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell.   And it seems natural that a high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept: there's no such thing.  <ImageHere> That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part.  Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup.  The reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it. Reporters sometimes call a few additional sources on their own, like someone adding a few fresh  vegetables to a can of soup. When one person is in charge he can take risks that a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though? Many people might suspect that language design is something where you should stick fairly close to the conventional wisdom. Show them a lot of works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to choose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better taste.So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have to discard the concept of good art. This isn't quite true.  They were subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and Instrument respectively.  <ImageHere>  What he actually said was that a great fortune with no apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed that it had been forgotten. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it.  And even that's going to be hard, because Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did in search a few years ago. \"Good\" and \"bad\" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated, so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the former. You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  Up till a couple decades ago, geography was destiny for cities. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more lives will be saved. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen.4 HackabilityThere is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being able to do what you want. C is like this.  <ImageHere> Our growth rate was fine.  But for someone at the top of the field, what's the test of doing well?  Runners can at least compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you think you could have run a bit faster.     November 2009I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process is broken. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see. And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the same way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the corresponding property.  Users had been climbing in through   the window for years before Apple finally moved the door.[5] Hint: the way to create a web-based alternative to Office may not be to write every component yourself, but to establish a protocol for web-based apps to share a virtual home directory spread across multiple servers. It's the everyday words that differ.  <ImageHere>  It was always understood that they enjoyed what they did. But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each user's data. Real hackers won't turn up their noses at a new tool that will let them solve hard problems with a few library calls.  The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts.  An essay has to come up with answers.  On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. I was right about that part.  The hard part of grasping evolution was to realize that species weren't, as they seem to be, unchanging, but had instead evolved from different, simpler organisms over unimaginably long periods of time.Now we don't have to make that leap.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure.  The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell your site is about. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Beirut number?",

You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages all evolved together with some application they were being used to write.  We managed to get press    hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed  to crack the print edition of the Times.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  I think a better model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development to a more powerful language instead.  They're going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however. Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense. Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and far left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the distribution of their opinions.  This was an era when small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and huge economies of scale. It was exciting for a while.  <ImageHere>  Even hackers can't tell.  You could not nest statements. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least language implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast code. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters. NaughtinessThough the most successful founders are usually good people, they tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone  till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn't seem correct. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice.  This site isn't lame.  <ImageHere> [7]Google doesn't try to force things to happen their way. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers.   In school  you are, in theory, explaining yourself to someone else.  What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is making money?I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different: the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for society. If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring intelligence. They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want to sell early.PrognosisWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to that is, some of each.  <ImageHere> In fact I think you ought to design for the  best programmers, but even the best programmers have limitations.  If you're writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it may be slightly faster.  They were mistaken. This was now only weeks away.  Central France in 1100, off (still feudal). In fact, that's an understatement. It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives, because that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. Designing algorithms for routing data through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing bridges. He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.And since his work became the map used by generations of future explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well.  <ImageHere>  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  When watches had mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time.  They hope further investment will save them. In one day it got 30,000 page views.  Most unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to find the right sort of community.[3] Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it. I didn't write essays.  But if you yourself don't have good taste,  how are you going to recognize a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills. But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate of anyone who wants to get things done.  It was a place people went in search of something new. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Doha number?",

Let users do what they want.  A lot of incoming students are interested in startups. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders.  So he proposes there are two kinds of theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and some that isn't.  We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. But they're more than that.  The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't.

They make such great stuff, but they're such assholes.  <ImageHere>  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved to Palo Alto to do it. Even the people who have the new ideas undervalue them initially.  I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people.  Mistake number one.  If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree.  The very design of the average site in the    late 90s was an abuse.  It was my fault I hadn't learned anything. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect himself from becoming one.  <ImageHere> By delaying learning VRML, I avoided having to learn it at all.So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating their message for years before people will start to get it.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that  don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them. Everything else has been done for you.The syntax of the language is brief to a fault.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think \"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\" It would set off alarms.  <ImageHere> And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer.   [4]People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize what a leap it must have been when they first started to. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital.  Similar sites include Digg, a technology news site that's rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and del.icio.us, the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" movement. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a randomly chosen eight year old.That was how I realized my father was wrong. And so interfaces tend not to change at all, which is a problem because they tend to be one of the most ad hoc parts of any system.One solution here might be to design systems so that interfaces are horizontal instead of vertical — so that modules are always vertically stacked strata of abstraction.  <ImageHere> Lewis's industry contacts also include the creative director of GQ.Ripped jeans and T-shirts are out, writes Mary Kathleen Flynn in US News & World Report.  Work for another company if you want to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own startup, go ahead.The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately was that I felt most would fail.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to decrease most other gaps.Alternative to an AxiomOne often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would increase the income gap between rich and poor.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Instead you get into a sort of flow.  I'm sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed any unresolved tension between them.Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.October 2004 As E. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Istanbul number?",

It turns out to have quite broad applications—for example, in genetic algorithms and even product design.  They control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce. They launch it with no marketing and initially have only a few (fanatically devoted) users. Apple itself did.  No philosopher ever refuted another, for example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute.

For example, explicit support for programs with multiple users, or data ownership at the level of type tags.Server-based applications also give us the answer to the question of what this new Lisp will be used to hack. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year.  Just not now.  In the early era, philology actually mattered.  <ImageHere>  At about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics.   That idea is not exactly novel. [8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote.  I'm saying that he'll make you a tractor to replace your horse.Notes[1] Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some of those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university students, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists—have the least experience creating it. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me.  Observation confirms this too: cities either have a startup scene, or they don't. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a  marginal medium at first.  I learned that I don't exist.  Screens were a lot smaller in 1998.  <ImageHere> Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group. They're the two most independent-minded people  I know, and in completely different ways.  This side of the mountain is a nice gradual slope. If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language from a bad one. I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books a package tour.  <ImageHere> This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours.  Then you could see in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's Principia is, but the way a garbled message is.Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren't expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score goals. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.  If anyone should know this, Apple should.  The nature of the problems change.  Buildings to be constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.What made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you could actually make the finished work from the prototype.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does.  <ImageHere>  Human problems are the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome. And yet I can't write a general purpose function that I can call on any struct. Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is in software.  They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen. They're the two most independent-minded people  I know, and in completely different ways. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type.  Instead of laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students, he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100 + 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get the answer, 5050.[2] A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems, and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Los Angeles number?",

If I already have momentum on some project, I can work in noisy places.  It's for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their company against something that's going to fall over, taking them with it.For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a natural tendency to stop looking for other investors.  Designing systems of great mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us than pandering to human weaknesses.  You remember: topic sentence, introductory paragraph, supporting paragraphs, conclusion.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the government.[4] People commonly use the word \"procrastination\" to describe what they do on the Internet.  They know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do. And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable. [11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small.  <ImageHere>  For example, we seem to have a very limited capacity for dealing with detail. I even wrote a couple that  weren't about startups. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot.  If not, you're in trouble.Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries, and concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it had syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have versions. It's a fine thing for schools to  teach students how to write.  \"The suit is back,\" it begins.Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms.  [6]Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Why is that so?  Is there some way to beat this limitation?I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires a dictator.  <ImageHere> I'm not trying to discover anything new. But I don't know enough to say whether there is a pattern here. In everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.  Credit card debt is a bad idea, period.  And it applies to startups too. I've gotten better at it.  All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves, simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards.  If your company makes software to do x, have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and another that uses these tools to write the applications.  Screens were a lot smaller in 1998.  But ITA made it interesting by  redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to them.Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers' general attitude of disobedience.  If the company does well and the valuation of the next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step.  <ImageHere> Someone who's not a programmer would find it hard to imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug.  But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like \"fairly big.\"  They want statements with punch, like \"top ten.\" And PR firms give them what they want.  That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s. If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs. You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program.  But they're wrong.  Perhaps it's because startups are less of a zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed by competitors. Prose can be rewritten over and over until you're happy with it. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of.  And certainly  Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay about color or baseball.How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go back almost a thousand years.  <ImageHere>  There were a lot of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?\"  Conversations with corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of stopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price you think they'll offer.And then you're really in trouble.  Don't the French realize these aren't startups?Building office buildings for technology companies won't get you a silicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup happens before they want that kind of space.  An established company may get away with such an opaque description, but no startup can.  Also, you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will have more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing? That's what you're addicted to.  Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master.  Most of the big successes have two or three. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Delhi number?",

That is the essence of hacking.  I'd modify that now. It was as weird as it sounds.  This had only recently been declared a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative technique didn't work. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.  A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it.Data is by definition easy to copy. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.   When we cook one up we're not always 100% sure which kind it is. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. The bumbler will shoot himself in the foot anyway. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke.  They are to the   startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.  <ImageHere> Nothing is deprecated, or retained for compatibility. Garbage-collection.6.  It had a programmable crawler that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out the products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least two times, maybe three. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree.  We may not be able to optimize for both simultaneously.Society seems to have voted for intelligence. It also tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a schmoozer. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was mathematics, or at least something like a natural science. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  It may take a good long while for the more prestigious universities to cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes,  but at the other end of the scale there are so many universities competing to attract students that the mere establishment of a discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.High schools imitate universities.  <ImageHere> (He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would want to do such things.  And the Internet makes copies easy to distribute. It was as weird as it sounds.  This had only recently been declared a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative technique didn't work.  This will sound shocking, but it may be that they aren't. [4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators. If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs. Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble.  But the Wufoos are exceptionally disciplined.[2] Incidentally, this phenomenon is not limited to startups.  They were mistaken.  They wanted yellow. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. Later, when you want to optimize, there's a really good profiler that tells you where to focus your attention. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers.  <ImageHere> Having new ideas is a lonely business.  Maybe the answer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design whatever object systems they want as libraries.3.  When you're writing desktop software, there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. Nothing could be better, for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters.  That group says another.  My guess is a significant number.[4] After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:\"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly.  This is easier in most other fields.  It could be simply that many famous scientists worked when collaboration was less common.Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  <ImageHere> In young hackers, optimism predominates.  You're given this marvellous thing, and then poof, it's taken away. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed.  But I don't think we will, with server-based software.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the forces that push you to overhire.  Then you could see in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  No disaster results.  But if you yourself don't have good taste,  how are you going to recognize a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio. 4.  It's possible to buy expensive, handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Chicago number?",

He bought a suit.\" I ran after him, and sure enough, it was. Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long touchdown pass.  Comment on this essay.December 2019There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose and by accident.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex, revenge. You never have to.  What we call \"metaphysics\" Aristotle called \"first philosophy.\"[9] Some of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.[10] Sokal, Alan, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,\" Social Text 46/47, pp.  <ImageHere>  That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities.  Indeed, the law of supply and demand insures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. Wanted:  Woman with hammer.Notes[1] When Google adopted \"Don't be evil,\" they were still so small that no one would have expected them to be, yet.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.  Lisp code, after it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax. I say \"for what it's worth\" because they never do.  [2] 2.  <ImageHere>  What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing will move from the desktop onto remote servers. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.  If you want to get real work done in an office with cubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or late or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  But as the company grows older, the question switches from meaningless to critical.   In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  <ImageHere>  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun, and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.  They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  You could have both now.  I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom coming through the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're starting something new, that requires complete quiet.  I think it's mainly not having to have a three hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating the Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the construction industry.  Even if you were     willing to pay to read them yourself, you can't link to them. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  <ImageHere>  And since human nature limits the size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work together the way components of a market economy do.That might be worth exploring. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an increasingly important component of programming languages. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked some concepts that would have made their lives easier.  Among them were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  This is the tone of someone writing down to their audience.Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Port Louis number?",

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb.  At least, it did when people wrote about it online. Now to people he meets at parties he's a real poet. But if the ideas you use in your work intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices: be an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.Notes[1] It's possible in theory for one side to be entirely right and the other to be entirely wrong.  Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.  [2] But that doesn't work with startups. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging.  Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.  It's exciting that there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good work.   With a tractor an energetic farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team of horses.  <ImageHere>  Between about 500 and 1000, life was not very good in Europe.  (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. So most people pre-emptively lower their expectations.  Within the US, there are no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least, first-rate computer science departments.So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a university, but one of the top handful in the world.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored.  No one does  that  kind of thing for fun.The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.  There were ashtrays everywhere.  Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.  So don't underestimate this task.  <ImageHere> Anyone can publish essays online. So learn and use its full range. A servant girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8) says that a skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000. If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem. [3]There are many exceptions to this rule. That one is easy: don't hire too fast.  The software business learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed that although the words \"software\" and \"publisher\" fit together, the underlying concepts don't.  Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely.  Like the rest of the creative class, they want to live somewhere with personality.What exactly is personality?  I think it's the feeling that each building is the work of a distinct group of people.  <ImageHere> Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale.   [8] The Chinese and Greek words we translate as \"happy\" didn't mean exactly what we do by it, but there's enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.Is the mathematician a small man because he's discontented?  No; he's just doing a kind of work that wasn't very common in Confucius's day.Human knowledge seems to grow fractally.  There's an idea that has turned out to be widely applicable.     January 2006To do something well you have to like it.  The company is ultimately doomed.  This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. Lisp 1.5 didn't have macros, for example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a couple years using Lisp to write real programs. Or that's what it feels like.  <ImageHere>  Now we admire the genius.  Another startup might have needed a database guy, or someone with connections in the movie business.This is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies, incidentally.  Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves rich. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance.  It may take a good long while for the more prestigious universities to cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes,  but at the other end of the scale there are so many universities competing to attract students that the mere establishment of a discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.High schools imitate universities. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn't know but would probably like. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting.

And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do. They're perfectly justified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a waste of time, and eventually go away.  Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple weeks has been trained to click on Back after following a link.  Give me a million dollars and I'll figure out what to do. Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be any syntax for it.  And as many programmers have observed since, one is very often mistaken about where these bottlenecks are.So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good profiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed.  An essayist can't have quite as little foresight as a river.  If you were dropped at a random point in America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.  <ImageHere> But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same.  Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them. In fact I don't intend to make any   more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary. Corn SyrupA group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake tribe.  I find that American adults are no better or worse informed about literature than art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature in high school and no time at all studying art.  If you wanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for example, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would be the place to do it. for getting both is the same.  <ImageHere> Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.I wondered about this for years.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.  Which is also to the founders' advantage if it means they still control the company.[5] In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you dilute yourselves to set aside an \"option pool\" as well. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. at the final whistle, the fatigue hits you like a wave.  The information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared.  <ImageHere>  There are some whose definition of important problems includes only those on the critical path to med school.[9] I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring ideas intolerable. Using first and rest means 50% more typing.  Here's an intriguing possibility. That one is easy: don't hire too fast.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. And in the early 1970s, before C, MIT's dialect of Lisp, called MacLisp, was one of the only programming languages a serious hacker would want to use.Today Lisp is the scripting language of two moderately popular systems, Emacs and Autocad, and for that reason I suspect that most of the Lisp programming done today is done in Emacs Lisp or AutoLisp.Programming languages don't exist in isolation. Designing software that works on the assumption that everyone will  have your client is like designing a society on the assumption that everyone will just be honest.  <ImageHere>  Each year. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive.  How?What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of situations.  The toolmakers would have users, but they'd only be the company's own developers.  So if you're the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit.  It's true even in the smartest companies.  I was very impressed by the papers published in philosophy journals. For expert hackers, that really is a problem.  Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.  It would make sense for super-angels to want low valuations if they're hoping to invest in startups that get bought early.  If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise), and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you and make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics.  Or, to put it more nicely, overworked.  They shut down a few months later.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk about the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an  odd idea.  The only point of buying one now is to advertise that you can.Or consider watches. So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998.  But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs. Languages are for programmers, and libraries are what programmers need.It's hard to design good libraries.  <ImageHere> Maxim magazine publishes an annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups and grisly accidents.  Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think.  When you're just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be  able to set x to some value and then start doing things to x.  They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.  But the really striking change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have to decide which we prefer.  <ImageHere>  I thought in Basic.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain you a bit, because they also motivate you. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb.  For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  Who are all those people?  They have no idea.  It's true even in the smartest companies.  Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said before they could figure out what he meant. Maybe the best way to put it is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating doughnuts.Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be working in a way that's more natural for humans.I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that I'd only seen in zoos before.  <ImageHere>  Or more precisely, in Trevor's office. If you're the one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there's a hole in your model of the world. It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O.8 EfficiencyA good language, as everyone knows, should generate fast code. In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.   [6]To attract the young, a town must have an intact center. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting.  And there is a role for mathematical elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. The current paradigm seems so perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it.  <ImageHere> We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth spending a lot to market it.If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you think most will choose?It's the same with work.  So what is the difference?  If we look at how people use the words \"wise\" and \"smart,\" what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.Curve\"Wise\" and \"smart\" are both ways of saying someone knows what to do.  Some might say it's part of science, but it's not part of any specific science; it's literally meta-physics (in our sense of \"meta\").

But ambitious programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than going to work at a big company.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure out what's actually wrong with him, and treat that.This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the practice of good design can be derived, and around which most design issues center.If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?  When I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good  design aims at some kind of   lowest common denominator.  Time after time, something that seemed a small and uninteresting area—experimental error, even—turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in it as all knowledge up to that point. The whole language always available.  <ImageHere>  Architecture is related to physics, in the sense that architects have to design buildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects is to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.  You don't need to know this stuff to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to  anyone who wants to understand the essence of Lisp  both in the sense of its origins and its semantic core.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people to collaborate on a research project. For companies that offer server-based applications, it will make a very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can support per server.In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor, and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric to take earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  And what drives them both is the number of startup people around you.The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of a startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest in starting a company to actually doing it. Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  <ImageHere>  Most of the big successes have two or three.  The wise man was someone who knew what the right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he'd done the best he could.  This is true to a degree in most fields.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's just what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they can buy wholesale.   In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  You could have both now.  The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in Boston. The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired a few generations later.  There is a lot more to discover.Notes [1] In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite some progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize a small percentage of statements.  <ImageHere>  In high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. [16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding.  It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  I don't think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. It wasn't that they were stupid. Don't Maltreat UsersI think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements of \"Web 2.0.\"  I also see a third: not to maltreat users.  There's a huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like Borgognone.  <ImageHere>  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time. 92.[15] Frankfurt, Harry, On Bullshit,  Princeton University Press, 2005.[16] Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any particular truths you'll learn.  Or more precisely, in Trevor's office.  Instead of trying to answer the question:    What are the most general truths?  let's try to answer the question    Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?  The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read what we've written to do anything differently afterward.  Now almost every drawing teacher will tell you that the right way to get an accurate drawing is not to work your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will accumulate and you'll find at the end that the lines don't meet.

Users don't know what all the choices are, and are often mistaken about what they really want.The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design for the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply   what he says he wants. Nearly all of them are left to write.Although the essay  is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously cultivated.   Some people are lucky enough to know what they want to do when they're 12, and just glide along as if they were on railroad tracks. If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only get 1.5x. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. TryShould you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound pretty hard.  <ImageHere>  If you wanted more wealth, you could make it.This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl.In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor  written in C++ and Perl. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.  He then went through two more ideas before settling on Greplin. It was not until Perl 5 (if then) that the language was suitable for writing serious programs, and yet it was already massively popular.What makes a language good for throwaway programs? To start with, it must be readily available.  There's no way to prove a text is meaningless. But in practice that's little consolation.In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. Which means if you take this route, your ideas will seem a lot like ones that already exist.  <ImageHere>  He can do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him to foreign countries.  [10] Like serfs, the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.  Just continue running your company as if this deal didn't exist.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of them.  So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse. I'm using these names as we use the name \"Homer,\" to mean the hypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.[7] Analects VII:36, Fung trans.Some translators use \"calm\" instead of \"happy.\"  One source of difficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different idea of happiness from many older societies.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC investments is dictated by the structure of VC funds, not the needs of startups.  <ImageHere> But I don't think ordinary programmers' opinions matter. [1]If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer.  There are some domains where there's almost nothing new. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school.  I always used to feel some misgivings about rereading books.  I predict this practice will gradually disappear though.[6] The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible note with no valuation cap at all. And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.  Anyone in the arts could tell you that you might want different mediums for the two situations.  And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot.  The trend is clear: the more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is. It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast.  <ImageHere>  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the variation we see is something that more and more fields will see as time goes on. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. We lived in the Unix world. And if you're doing really well, you can safely talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high, and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll be confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle. She writes:    Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled   the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a   problem and solve it.  Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.(The reason it's hard to learn new skills late in life is not just that one's brain is less malleable.

That's the whole point of technology. Though arguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose them are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts in political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get legislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon.  When he wanted to go to work on a saturday, he found it easier to say that it was because he \"had to\" for some reason, rather than admitting he preferred to work than stay home with them.[3] Something similar happens with suburbs.  But they aren't all equivalent, not by a long shot.  This was the only kind of work available at the time.  They're half technology and half religion.[6] And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it.  <ImageHere> But we didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. There will always be both supply and demand. He called this language Lisp, for \"List Processing,\" because one of his key ideas was to use a simple data structure called a list for both code and data.It's worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is tending to become in our own time.  At least, it did when people wrote about it online. It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up.  That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.1.  <ImageHere>  It took me years to grasp that.JobsBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half the work of essay writing.  EBay didn't win by paying less for servers than their competitors.Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a growth industry in the mid twentieth century. That's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the paleolithic era.  No one in an industrialized country encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an adult.  You had to grow fast or die.  A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100? [1]Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones. This is usually done to make the implementation easier to port, but it could be a useful language feature.  <ImageHere> [3]It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living.  If you had one, you were rich.  And so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was no point in making anything else return a value, because there could not be anything waiting for it.This limitation went away with the arrival of block-structured languages, but by then it was too late. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004. 2. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there.

Chan School of Public Health.Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the most conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number of lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops.The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission.  The point is that a large organization is compelled by its structure to be one. It meant there would be a whole new generation of  essays. Developers have been able to assume that each user would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their desk.  It was a lot of the company to give up in one shot. A startup has to sing for its supper. Lions in the wild seem about ten times more alive.

VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.  Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration.   And I don't have to know if I bet on everything just being on the server. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you can't be somewhat of a startup hub.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4.  Within months I was using it to make money as a freelance programmer.  Everyone else will move.Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.  Even colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things went wrong with them.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.  In the times when they weren't, philosophy was hopelessly intermingled with religion.  <ImageHere> And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them  more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent, there would be little justification for using any but the most popular.  Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users. Another approach would be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business.  After decades of competition that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition. And it may be more than a question of just solving a problem.  When you're starting a startup that depends on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're trying to ignore you out of existence.  <ImageHere> less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions.What I'm going to talk about today is what your target looks like from the back.  And so it became synonymous with California nuttiness. Often, indeed, it is not merely influence but command: often the expert hackers are the very people who, as their bosses or faculty advisors, tell the other programmers what language to use.The opinion of expert hackers is not the only force that determines the relative popularity of programming languages — legacy software (Cobol) and hype (Ada, Java) also play a role — but I think it is the most powerful force over the long term.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  <ImageHere>  What they really want is the software and the developers, and that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated software and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.  And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like. I would not be surprised if it is harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.  He redefined the problem as: make one that's beautiful. Now that I didn't need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision.  But it's harder than it looks. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing them.  He responded so eagerly that for about half a second I found myself considering doing it.In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't seem real.  You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.  That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.1.  <ImageHere>  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things.  The main reason PR   firms exist is that reporters are lazy. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something.  An ordinary laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae. Just wait till you've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do it for more than half the agreed upon price.  Later when things blow up they say \"I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.\"If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Astana number?",

They let their acquaintance drift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they had a lot in common with.For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote was Sergey Brin, and vice versa.  It's hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know,  Lisp code.  But this model doesn't work for software.  <ImageHere>  They're already stuck with a seller's market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still haven't invested. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. This is especially true for math expressions.  And certainly smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well as abstract ones.  I thought in Basic.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about which problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good solution. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess where these bottlenecks are. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is only moderately appealing.  <ImageHere> He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.And since his work became the map used by generations of future explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. Otherwise they stop being moderate.Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own answers, but choose their own questions.  But it's not just the user who's human. If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you have more freedom of choice.Which route should you take?  That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your lifetime) for what you want to do.  <ImageHere> For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein.  They go to school to study A, drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after taking it up on the side.Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness. Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the end of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  They could make it self-perpetuating if they used it to get all the best new startups.  But how do you avoid mistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so it has other defaults.  That's what the web naturally tends to produce.Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the web.  Even hackers can't tell.  This force works in both phases: both in the transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and the transition from starting a company to succeeding. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking.  <ImageHere>  You have to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised.That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is how to pick it.  [6]NewFor both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were necessarily related. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. [7]Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done.

When progress concentrates something we don't want to want—when it transforms opium into heroin—it seems bad.  And the success of companies, and countries, will depend increasingly on how they deal with it.If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  Indeed, the law of supply and demand insures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. The valuable part of English classes is learning to write, and that could be taught better by itself.  For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing?  Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad?  As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate.  You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  <ImageHere> To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying. Which means if you take this route, your ideas will seem a lot like ones that already exist.  [5] When you get to the end of the experts, look for the client.   And unless the forms of technological progress that produced these things are subject to different laws than technological progress in general, the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40.The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.  When cigarettes first appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through a previously isolated population. And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the language you choose. If anything they'll think more highly of you. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints.  <ImageHere> Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it's not what you might think. In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious people you find now in America.  They have an answer, certainly, but odds are it's wrong.A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly about her job.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. But there has to be some initial group of hackers using the language for others even to hear about it.  This includes mere conventions, like languages and safe combinations, and also what we'd call \"random\" facts, like movie stars' birthdays, or how to distinguish 1956 from 1957 Studebakers.[4] People seeking some single thing called \"wisdom\" have been fooled by grammar. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.  <ImageHere>  Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth is something that has to be generated.  Their reputation with programmers used to be great.  The one thing he'll never do is stand still.  But it would not be the first time that measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had the opposite of the intended effect.There is such a thing as Americanness.  But before we hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media came from. H.  And when wealth is something you're given, then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks weird. They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home.  You're better off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Morally, they care about getting the big questions right, but not about observing proprieties.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to.  <ImageHere> Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the  Worm that he didn't want his name on the site. It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled.  In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications. You may save him from referring to variables in another package, but you can't save him from writing a badly designed program to solve the wrong problem, and taking forever to do it.Good programmers often want to do dangerous and unsavory things.  [7] Then you're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things. And as an artist you could be truly independent. With the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before.

Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliar syntax.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky to get paid three times as much. It's the junk food of experience. They were an impressive group.  But it probably wouldn't start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.SirensWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends.

Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better. If there's anything that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions contradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted.Plus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confident. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do. Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition; it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you're still working for salary.  The mystery comes mostly from looking for something that doesn't exist.  <ImageHere>  You have to build a shield around it, or it will fry you.The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be useless if it were. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A lot of the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT at some point. The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise when they turned.  That way we can avoid applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant for wisdom.   Some people are lucky enough to know what they want to do when they're 12, and just glide along as if they were on railroad tracks. [10]The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise.  That principle, like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,    turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long forgotten origins.  Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary.  <ImageHere> [2]Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly.  You can get the software for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that programming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has. You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax; running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an idea recently reinvented as XML.  <ImageHere>  I suspect a lot of people realized this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than becoming philosophy professors.How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are interesting questions.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared. Imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging how good it is. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive VCs, they'll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and start to become more miserly about valuations. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Budapest number?",

I don't know the answer to this question.  We're a sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of people working on startups and their willingness to help one another are both artificially amplified.NumbersBoth components of the antidote—an environment that encourages startups, and chance meetings with people who help you—are driven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup people around you.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders to make them take off, and it's gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.  <ImageHere> It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital.

I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead of reading other people's. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall.  You shouldn't worry about prestige. A throwaway program is something that you expect to write in an hour.  <ImageHere>  Why do they do it? The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most mistakes founders make. They probably mean well. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.  They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt.  Wisdom is useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in deciding what to do with the solutions.[3] In judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out some knowledge.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows that pretty clearly.  Essays should aim for maximum surprise.I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel vicariously. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. We'd start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd been talking about.  I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000.  How was the place different from what they expected?  This is an extremely useful question.  <ImageHere>  Plant it in the wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.To spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that has attractions other than the university.  I've found that people who are great at something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.   [4]  Since board seats last about 5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once, that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner per year.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and the study he quoted was published in 1968.  So the previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly blurred.There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs. And yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid.  <ImageHere>  You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.  We now have several examples to prove that amateurs can    surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to  channel their efforts.     The problem with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm.  The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was look at their job listings. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time has come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.  With server-based software, you can use any language you want, so if someone does design a language that actually seems better than others that are available, there will be people who take a risk and use it.2.  Before that I used whatever scraps of paper I could find. Nothing could be better, for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters.  Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid.  In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how much effort it costs. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Damascus number?",

The unusual thing about Lisp  in fact, the defining quality of Lisp  is that it can be written in itself.  If you write in Latin, no one can understand you. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how reasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to     do, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would make as much of a difference as having first class functions or recursion or even keyword parameters. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of detective novels. 75.[12] A preliminary result, that all metaphysics between Aristotle and 1783 had been a waste of time, is due to I. The best we can do is to recognize that it's happening, and to understand that being a magnet for criticism is sometimes a sign not that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they're the right one.  <ImageHere>  And even then they rarely said so outright.If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little progress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the Renaissance.In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it was not only acceptable to produce works like the Metaphysics, but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a class of people called philosophers.  As Ben Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is what life is made of.So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money.  And since human nature limits the size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work together the way components of a market economy do.That might be worth exploring.  They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet.  <ImageHere>  In  Ansi Common Lisp I tried to move things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn't get to macros until page 160.But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.  [10]And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected it was a waste of time just studied other things.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching   thunderstorm.It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures intended to protect national security and intellectual property turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes    America successful.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't save you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage. Anyone can publish essays online.  <ImageHere> It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn't have known where to start.  But apparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how things work. But a very proper subset.  After all, they know good PR firms won't lie to them.A good flatterer doesn't lie, but tells his victim selective truths (what a nice color your eyes are).  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately large percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that the very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is identical to the question, how do you design a good programming language?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting question.3. Early adopters are sophisticated and demanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your technology. But in Silicon Valley it seems normal. The organic growth method is exemplified by the classic seat-of-the-pants underfunded garage startup.  Most of the people who've had to write PhD disserations about Dickens don't.  <ImageHere>  A song on an LP is physically stamped into the plastic. Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough.Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  And so it became synonymous with California nuttiness.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America. [2]  I know if something major happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it    will show up there.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work.  Selection beats damping, for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.Even the startups are different this time around.  This site isn't lame. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Shanghai number?",

If you  don't and a competitor does, you're in trouble.iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense.  It is also palpably short. It's a fine thing for schools to  teach students how to write.  The democracy  component, for example—that's not an innovation, in the sense of something someone made happen.    We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of   pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests   of contradictory and confusing truths. [1] Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in groups of several hundred.  If you're sure of the general area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route. [15] And there is nothing the rich like more than convenience.  [13] Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about how words worked.  <ImageHere>  If you force   yourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing the things in the language that required so much explanation.5.  So it is no wonder companies are afraid.  This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know. They can help you improve your language, but they can also deter you from improving it. If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment business, that might be different.  You don't want to have to declare the type of x first.  Ultimately power rests with the founders.  Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrong things. It was future startup founders.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you.  In a startup, there's always some disaster happening.  <ImageHere>  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't.  The four causes: open source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot cheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest expenses.  About a year after we started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering starting another startup.  Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed.  Not just founders, but investors too. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example.  <ImageHere>  That sounds good. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. It is massive.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores, so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic. How are they to hear? From other hackers.  Essayer is the French verb meaning \"to try\" (the cousin of our word assay),  and an \"essai\" is an effort. So I remember his exact words very clearly.  It had a programmable crawler that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out the products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least two times, maybe three.  Universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  90% of what ends up in my essays was stuff I only thought of when I sat down to write them. Lisp is a natural fit for server-based applications. But don't think you can predict them all.  <ImageHere> He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp.  [5]This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive and yet naive and mistaken.  They were not even on a path to anything interesting. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong.Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated.

But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to turn back the evolution of technology.  Bertie Wooster seems long gone.  I didn't ever quite understand these papers, but I figured I'd get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more closely. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there.  It never gets any easier.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to.  <ImageHere>  Really they ought to be out there digging up stories for themselves.  The information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.  There hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants to buy you. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy feeling when I look at my bookshelves.  We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the Web.  The only way a startup can have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it. Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive or default dead.If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy calculator you can use to find out.The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the answer.  <ImageHere>  But it's an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases.  Joe's has good burritos.  Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration. Real hackers won't turn up their noses at a new tool that will let them solve hard problems with a few library calls.  Instead of having one or two big releases a year, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a series of small changes.  He was Gorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein gave it.  One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.It is possible to slow time somewhat.  <ImageHere> For example, by doing things that don't scale, or by redesigning the product in the way only founders can. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific, and then gradually make them more general.  By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't.  And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. In high school he designed computers on paper for fun. Fortunately policies are software; Apple can change them instantly if they want to. At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be zero rather than negative.  <ImageHere>  Give me a million dollars and I'll figure out what to do.  Plus series A terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of important decisions, including selling the company.  The ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine publishing.  Anything so admired and so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could only figure out what.Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley.  In fact they were more law schools. Brevity is always attractive to hackers, and never more so than in a program they expect to turn out in an hour.6 LibrariesOf course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. I suspect that very few housing projects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live in them.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Helsinki number?",

Imagine how incongruous the New York Times article about suits would sound if you read it in a blog:    The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,   prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--   is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace. Fortunately policies are software; Apple can change them instantly if they want to. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach.  Considering how basic a red circle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how few other companies used one as their logo. To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive VCs, they'll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and start to become more miserly about valuations.  <ImageHere> Because if there is such a thing as good art, it's easy to tell which of two people has better taste.  But for someone at the top of the field, what's the test of doing well?  Runners can at least compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you think you could have run a bit faster.  If it's large enough, the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass   the best in print.  Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularly well in a few.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy.  That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. In fact I think you ought to design for the  best programmers, but even the best programmers have limitations. The source code of all the libraries is readily available.  <ImageHere>  If anyone should know this, Apple should. Why not organize a summer program where they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session was about.  Mistake number two.  The only way to convince everyone that you're ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to.You have to be the right kind of determined, though.  If companies stuck to their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages, and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards.  But did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before  English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him.  <ImageHere>  But a startup can't do what all the other startups do. [4]Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people rather than ideas.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun.  It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold.  You either have a self-sustaining chain reaction, or not.  The only way a startup can have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it.  On the subway back from the airport she asked \"Why is everyone smiling?\"  I looked and they weren't smiling.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect they're nonsense generally keep quiet.  It is no accident that Silicon Valley is in America, and not France, or Germany, or England, or Japan.  Those places have too much momentum in the wrong direction. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach.  Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley.  <ImageHere>  There's a market for writing that sounds impressive and can't be disproven.  If you have a free version  and a pay version, don't make the free version too restricted.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly. In one place I worked, we had a big board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the founders. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme.  It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Almaty number?",

An optimism shield has to be pierced too. You can make inner loops blindingly fast, even writing inline byte code if you need to.There are lots of good examples to learn from, and the language is intuitive enough that you can learn how to use it from examples in a couple minutes. And yet they're proposing it anyway.  Of all the great programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily program in Java.  But it was obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.  And because of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  Since high school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as   sources of information.

I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging.  <ImageHere> The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done.  It says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution. Wearing suits, we're told, will make us  3.6 percent more productive.BuzzWhere the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of \"buzz.\"  They usually feed the same story to     several different publications at once.  Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. Someone who's not a programmer would find it hard to imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. [11]  His response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery that most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart person who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it further, but for how he acted in response.  <ImageHere> less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked some concepts that would have made their lives easier. You never have to.  <ImageHere> But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, or Boston, or Seattle. You see it in sponsored research too. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble. So one can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.  A few years before, I couldn't have done this.  Most of the people who've had to write PhD disserations about Dickens don't.  But a programming language isn't just a format.  So it does matter to have an audience.  Basically, what \"Ajax\" means is \"Javascript now works.\"  And that in turn means that web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop ones.As you read this, a whole new generation of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.  As a rule their interest is a function of growth.  Not necessarily, but probably.Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think—because the way to do great work is to find something you like so much that you don't have to force yourself to do it—finding work you love does usually require discipline.  <ImageHere> I'm using these names as we use the name \"Homer,\" to mean the hypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.[7] Analects VII:36, Fung trans.Some translators use \"calm\" instead of \"happy.\"  One source of difficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different idea of happiness from many older societies.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so we made them up.     March 2008, rev.  But sure enough, I thought, they did call them \"essays,\" didn't they?Well, they're not. FlexibilityYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases like \"don't give up on your dreams.\"  The world of startups is so unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the fly.  At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's standard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's.  There were a lot of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Johannesburg number?",

And that means there may be a struggle ahead.  Which is exciting because among other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect bias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least a random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of applicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.How does it work?  Think about what it means to be biased. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful.    We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of   pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests   of contradictory and confusing truths.  The \"trends\" we're seeing now are simply the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models that got imposed on it during the Bubble.I realized this when I read an  interview with Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite.  <ImageHere>  [6]If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full of security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual applications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating memory.  But that's still a problem for VCs.  The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent.  I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000.  Not recent ones; you wouldn't find those in our high school library. These people need your help.  They were all just side projects.  The root cause of variation in income, as Occam's Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation in every other human skill.In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about 100 times as much as the average person.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader   something he didn't already know.  Those companies were apparently willing to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's drive.  <ImageHere> I think future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language.  The problem here is, average performance means that you'll go out of business. It seems so convincing when you see the same program written in two languages, and one version is much shorter. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no one is forced to use it. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. You never have to. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. As you might expect, it winds all over the place. If a sentence doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and you've usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists.  <ImageHere> He couldn't build them because he couldn't afford the components.  But I didn't realize till the last   few years that writing for publication didn't have to mean writing that way. They can afford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding the launch has the side effect of making them celebrities.   3.  I don't think you can even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user.You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include the designer himself. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans.  After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her.  And I've heard several  hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at all.  It doesn't even have x (Blub feature of your choice).As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. ii.7.43).  <ImageHere>  The hackers who become famous tend to become famous by random accidents of PR.  I could rewrite the language if I wanted. This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But only if you keep going. But that doesn't mean you should avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.[3] I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders to overhire is not even in their own interest. But Rtm was right, as usual.  And as many programmers have observed since, one is very often mistaken about where these bottlenecks are.So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good profiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed. And that is just what tends to happen.  Then you want to do something else—even something mindless. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Maputo number?",

It's just as well to carry plugs.The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.   In painting, for example, all other things being equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than one without. Kant.[13] Wittgenstein asserted a sort of mastery to which the inhabitants of early 20th century Cambridge seem to have been peculiarly vulnerable—perhaps partly because so many had been raised religious and then stopped believing, so had a vacant space in their heads for someone to tell them what to do (others chose Marx or Cardinal Newman), and partly because a quiet, earnest place like Cambridge in that era had no natural immunity to messianic figures, just as European politics then had no natural immunity to dictators.[14] This is actually from the Ordinatio of Duns Scotus (ca.  <ImageHere> April 2003(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz Developer Symposium.) In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called  Viaweb.  The real problem is that in the group above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.  Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is applicable to potential founders at other ages.)One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give advice, you can ask yourself \"what would I tell my own kids?\"  My kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.Startups are very counterintuitive.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  It won't seem so preposterous in 10,000 years.  <ImageHere>  If you can figure out a way to turn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry, so much the better, if all fifty million go to you.  And Aristotle's explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the Metaphysics implies that philosophy should be useful too.Theoretical KnowledgeAristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles.  The great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would now call corruption than from commerce.  If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies. Hackers share the surgeon's secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards, the teenager's secret pleasure in popping zits.  (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate. It's a fine thing for schools to  teach students how to write. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it.  <ImageHere>  Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley.  Northern Italy in 1100, on. [10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience.  Or better still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that one.The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades before it was associated with technology.  But in general, for application software, you want to be using the most powerful (reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a lesser degree, as programming in machine language.You can see that machine language is very low level.  It happens naturally to anyone who does good work. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more lives will be saved. All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important job better than other languages.History offers some encouragement.  It was like being told to use dry water.  <ImageHere>  It's very valuable in practice to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand. Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.April 2005\"Suits make a corporate comeback,\" says the New York Times.  It would be a bummer to have another grim monoculture like we had in the 1990s.  In a series A round they want a third of your company, if they can get it.  You probably shouldn't even start a company to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two sentences.The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you've got, right away. And in addition to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate officers. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Baghdad number?",

Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries, and concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it had syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have versions.  Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to reach users, you do it on their terms. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best ones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a lot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific group of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.  <ImageHere>  At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about being discontented.If you feel exhausted, it's not necessarily because there's something wrong with you. Their lives are short too.  Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of the worst experiences that can happen to a startup.If you do want to sell, there's another set of  techniques  for doing that.  There is no core of knowledge one must master. But attention is a zero sum game.  If the company does well and the valuation of the next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it.  Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.  I didn't realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the change. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably the best person for the job.I don't think there is any solution to this problem.  It was English.  In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers.  <ImageHere> I was framing the question wrong.  If big companies weren't plagued by internal inefficiencies, they'd be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.[3] In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on schleps, but this sort of work is merely unglamorous, not bogus.[4] What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system? Management consulting.[5] The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get significant numbers of users, you've started it, whether you realize it yet or not.[6] It shouldn't be that surprising that colleges can't teach students how to be good startup founders, because they can't teach them how to be good employees either.The way universities \"teach\" students how to be employees is to hand off the task to companies via internship programs. They produce new ideas; maybe the rest of the company will be able to use them.You may not have to go to this extreme. They're perfectly justified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a waste of time, and eventually go away.  <ImageHere>  But it was wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.[5] Similarly, don't make users register to try your site.  Predecessors like \"understanding\" seem to have had a broader meaning.[6] There is of course some uncertainty about how closely the remarks attributed to Confucius and Socrates resemble their actual opinions. And yet there are clearly a lot of people who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Because if there is such a thing as good art, it's easy to tell which of two people has better taste.  It had a programmable crawler that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out the products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least two times, maybe three.  Now it's the career of thousands.  When you travel to a rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank accounts to tell which kind you're in. For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting. But in practice I don't think fast code comes primarily from things you do in the design of the language.  <ImageHere>  And although the first may be weakening because it's now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.  Most good startup ideas seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone would have done them already.(How many people are going to want computers in their houses? What, another search engine?)That's the connection between technology and liberalism. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree.  It gives people with good intentions a new roadmap into abstraction. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Madrid number?",

We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.[19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students.  Without exception the high-tech cities in the US are also the most liberal.  And the best paying jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles.  Even Google didn't come close to that.So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies that will get bought. They think of the profiler as an add-on, at best. In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of the classic type.  Just not now.  This must have affected what they said.  <ImageHere>  You might as well buy Apple.So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could get acquired quickly, that would explain why they'd care about valuations. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.  Most new businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those don't scale.[4] As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of startup people in the Valley. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me.  Lisp wasn't designed to fix the mistakes in Fortran; it came about more as the byproduct of an attempt to axiomatize computation.  If your company makes software to do x, have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and another that uses these tools to write the applications.  <ImageHere>  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" was coined.2.  We now have several examples to prove that amateurs can    surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to  channel their efforts.  And you can tell they really believe this, because it affects their investment decisions.Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors. And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work  doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual currency of research papers.  About a year after we started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering starting another startup.  One of the reasons Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family.  It seems like the type that matters most is imagination.  <ImageHere> But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each user's data.  It's supposed to be about the ultimate truths.  Since high school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as   sources of information. But we didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it.  And whether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  <ImageHere>  Surely that field, at least, is tapped out.  They go to school to study A, drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after taking it up on the side.Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness. You can observe big new ideas being born all around you right now. Now I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down.   So before agreeing to meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, \"Do we want to sell the company right now?\"  And if the answer is no, tell them \"Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company.\"  They won't be offended.  It's this fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the detail, we could just program in machine language.Remember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Yangon number?",

        "question": "Respond to inquiries about the images with concise and direct explanations.\n<ImageHere> Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards.  You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized easily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay  are a good example.  [9] Soon after, the western world fell on intellectual hard times.  As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the third empirically false.  They're responding to the market.The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups, because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one another. Their format is convenient, and the de facto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfect filter.  And now I have independent evidence: the top links on Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather   than to magazine articles or news stories.My experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation.  Smoking rapidly became a (statistically) normal thing.  <ImageHere>  It has to be a place where investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors are nerds themselves. School, it was implied, was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids. It also tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a schmoozer. They're more like examples of Robert Frost's \"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances of good design together, but within each individual project, one person has to be in control.I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think of everything. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing.  The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors.  <ImageHere>  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.  I still don't even have a flying car. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. Instead of thinking of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.  It's supply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for it.Most nerds like quieter pleasures. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. But we could tell the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.  But why would they be looking for those?   Because depending on the meaning of \"quickly,\" it could actually be very profitable.  That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty descriptions of landscapes, or pretentious philosophizing.  At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's standard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's.  But writing an interface to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the bugs are random.  <ImageHere>  Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork.  That's what the web naturally tends to produce.Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the web. This is a feature of brains, not a bug.  By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. But painting was post-rigorous.  That's what bit me.  Where they fall relative to one another is a sensitive topic. [5] In this model, the research department functions like a mine.  But when you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones, something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention explicitly. [2] The dictator in the 1984 ad isn't Microsoft, incidentally; it's IBM.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of detective novels.  Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid of it too.  <ImageHere> A startup has to sing for its supper.  It has to be a place where investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors are nerds themselves. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. It's human nature.  What they need is a language that can show them what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  Technology will increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.   But for some reason we treat this skill differently.  Even if it's the right thing    for your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves. There Is Always Room.I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might be good to add a social component to their software. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Cairo number?",

They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing confidence in our beliefs.  And we were always far ahead of them in features. Real hackers won't turn up their noses at a new tool that will let them solve hard problems with a few library calls.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you can start to count on investors being interested even if you're not profitable. It wasn't that they were stupid.  <ImageHere>  I was very impressed by the papers published in philosophy journals. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator.  Or more precisely, in Trevor's office.  There was not much point in making more than you could hide.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them, at least.Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory in one lifetime. Lexical closures provide a way to get the effect of subroutines when the ui is just a series of web pages. But a very proper subset.  In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll hire you as a waiter at his next party.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  <ImageHere>  So why do they need to fix anything?They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because they make such great hardware. They're the two most independent-minded people  I know, and in completely different ways.  Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both.   [3]PersonalityHowever, merely creating a new university would not be enough to start a silicon valley.  In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  So I hope people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers were similarly naive. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. For example, they'll almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll take it.  <ImageHere>  These people made philosophy professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians.  When we were making the rounds of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software companies didn't win by writing great software, but through brand, and dominating channels, and doing the right deals.They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  When people applying to medical school ask her for advice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don't do it!\"  (But she never does.) How did she get into this fix?  In high school she already wanted to be a doctor. Many of the interesting applications written in the near future will be server-based, and the number of users per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such applications.  He was off by only about 2%.[6] No, and Windows, respectively.[7] One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and reality is the valuation of hard work. United States in 1974, on. Much as a vaccine can be.  An essay is not a reference work. Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs.  <ImageHere>  But I'm convinced they got this right by  accident. The record labels agreed, reluctantly. What a sentence to be able to write.November 2022Since I was about 9 I've been puzzled by the apparent contradiction between being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and the feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per machine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational bottlenecks. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble.  It's more important to grow fast.  He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn.  They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Yangon number?",

We funded them because we liked the founders so much. [12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed.  They just wanted to make the point that the web mattered again. It is so much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother.  But as knowledge has grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader   something he didn't already know.  You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up.  <ImageHere> But they don't have to be. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity.  So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.[7] The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer.  Programming languages are for hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.1 The Mechanics of PopularityIt's true, certainly, that most people don't choose programming languages simply based on their merits.  \"Wise\" means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s it was fashionable to design new programming languages.  But they're looking for a way out.  The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time.  <ImageHere> But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.[15] I've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed.  But startups are often mistaken about that.Thanks to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Patrick Collison, James Lindenbaum, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.October 2015When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or 9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.  But when I first met him, I thought he was a complete idiot.  Oh boy!  They make such great stuff. My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing will move from the desktop onto remote servers. I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door.  Even Google didn't come close to that.So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies that will get bought.  If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same.  <ImageHere> Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and far left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the distribution of their opinions.  You can see this most clearly in New York, which attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it. Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the most radioactively controversial questions, from which (because they're writing for a popular magazine) they then proceed to recoil from in terror.  And as for the disputation, that seems clearly a net lose.  It seems odd to be surprised by that.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR departments. In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the Renaissance. It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult, and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy; it introduced students to cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark.  <ImageHere>  Most founders doing series A deals would prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock after using the first half of the money to increase its value.  Life isn't an expression; how could it have meaning? But it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning. I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  You turn the fan back on, and the noise starts again.  It has to be good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands of miles away. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. In ancient times it covered a broad range of topics, comparable in scope to our \"scholarship\" (though without the methodological implications).

Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn't have. This approach is less daunting, and the design of the program benefits from evolution.  Their houses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood are different sizes, but within them life is similar.  Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then.  One is that these users are the people they want as employees.  This was the only kind of work available at the time.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express rank.  If you start the company, you'll have the most freedom.  Now that Lisp dialects are among the faster languages available, that excuse has gone away.  At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth.  <ImageHere>  So it does matter to have an audience. And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet seats.How do you avoid copying the wrong things?  Copy only what you genuinely like.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard.  Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or heresy.[3] Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  If the company does well and the valuation of the next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. [16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding.  <ImageHere>  Your results will speak for themselves. ConsequencesThat has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.  And yet if I had to write down everything I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a page.  More and more we were starting to hear about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have cycles to spare. Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L-word. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did.  If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what they do.  We can confirm this empirically.  You're better off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. By delaying learning VRML, I avoided having to learn it at all.So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating their message for years before people will start to get it.  <ImageHere>     October 2014(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's startup class at Stanford.  Intellectually, it is just as worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper about.1.  People tell the craziest lies about me.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own startup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working the way people are meant to.Notes[1] When I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a certain way, I mean by evolution.[2] It's not only the leaves who suffer.  They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you and make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.  So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  <ImageHere>  Most people have had the experience of working hard on some problem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed, and then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning.  Users don't need benchmarks to run fast.  By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online.  Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups before Google does. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  I learned a lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy 101. There was no time to lose.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest version.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable? Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be changeable. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Cairo number?",

But I was never able to figure out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was killing all the potential startups. It's odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical.  But the guys at Google didn't think search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  One developer told me:    As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked   applications.  You'd have to be a very promising startup indeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a few percent of you.Since angels generally don't take board seats, they don't have this constraint.  <ImageHere>  Who are all those people?  They have no idea. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be.  And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded yet. Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.  It's not just a synonym for annoying. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. And yet I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there.  <ImageHere> There's a narrow sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one in which it refers to preferences of any kind.  And not just for the obvious reason that more competition for deals means better terms.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas, you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students. Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth spending a lot to market it.If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you think most will choose?It's the same with work. They'll lie to you on this one.  He once told a Sunday school class    Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never   took the first drink.  Never send them email unless they explicitly ask for it.  <ImageHere> If you work this way, then in principle you never have to end the day with something that actually looks unfinished.  It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  Design is all about people.  But it's not just the user who's human. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most people's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.  (Fortran at that time only had a conditional goto, closely based on the branch instruction in the  underlying hardware.)  McCarthy, who was on the Algol committee, got conditionals into Algol, whence they spread to most other languages.2.  <ImageHere>  They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded. It's more in the nature of an investment.)[2] When one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it sounds like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian child-heroes of Edith Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods.[3] According to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total compensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise of stock options, of S&P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million.  I carefully chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup. So although not knowing how you know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.  [7] 6. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic San Francisco number?",

(The philosophy's there, but it's woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.) If you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loud to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better.  In print they had to cut the last item because they didn't have room.)1.  There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that, so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much.  They were so beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating—alternately casual and buffer-overflowingly technical. A button that looks like it will make a machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets like MIT and Stanford.This sounds hard.  <ImageHere>  Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush.  And so instead of correcting the problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it—that you can easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas—they  continued to fall into it.The SingularityCuriously, however, the works they produced continued to attract new readers. You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you've got so far.People who do good work often think that whatever they're working on is no good.  A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Values are what have types, not variables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.5.  In math you don't choose abstractions because they're easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the proof shorter.  <ImageHere>  But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure. The most amusing thing written during this period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is, I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.Around 1000 Europe began to catch its breath. [7]Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  They were subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and Instrument respectively. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own startup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working the way people are meant to.Notes[1] When I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a certain way, I mean by evolution.[2] It's not only the leaves who suffer. They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well.  In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications.  <ImageHere>  That was new.  (It's arguably implicit in making functions first class objects.)4.  We did that as an inside joke when we started YC. The conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is the real one. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together.  Meaning that when the note converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company. Designing algorithms for routing data through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing bridges. Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of their less confident successors.  But knowing how it's really done should at least help you to understand the feeling of futility you have when you're writing the things they tell you to. They give reporters genuinely valuable information.  <ImageHere> There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem.  And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented.  It's easy to let the days rush by. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.  After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist. So perhaps one reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence using recipes for wisdom. Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading  drafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming.  You have to do that with hardware, but because software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels.  At some firms it's over 50%.Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Istanbul number?",

If not, you're in trouble.Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want. But another less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them.  Presumably they were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent cosmologies.  I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to contradict it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you and make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics.  We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.   In painting, for example, all other things being equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than one without.  <ImageHere> His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure it's worth hearing.  If I was any good, why didn't I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I now believe, is like a runner asking \"If I'm such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; they just get tired at higher speeds.People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same position as the runner.  But did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  I get attacked a lot online.  [6]Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  A young architect has to take whatever work he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position to pick and choose among projects.  They just wanted to make the point that the web mattered again. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort.  I wasn't trying to meet people; I was just having lunch.  <ImageHere> But someone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do it well.Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideas you work with. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past.  Another probably even worse obstacle is that one has higher standards.)I realize we're on dangerous ground here.  I'm not sure how much credit to give him.  The drawbacks will only become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of malaise.And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like the Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority of the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to. [4] The second is that different startups need such different things, so you need a lot of people to supply each startup with what they need most.  That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you to stop looking.  <ImageHere>  When Google was founded, the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search was boring and unimportant.  We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it's done.If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better.  It's easy to let the days rush by. [1]The Secret WeaponEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\" and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn.  The key stage is when they're three guys operating out of an apartment.  And in desktop software there is a big bias toward writing the application in the same language as the operating system.  If I'm right, then it really pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.  <ImageHere>  There is a lot more urgency once you release. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by reductio ad absurdum.  The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. By unsavory I mean things that go behind whatever semantic facade the language is trying to present: getting hold of the internal representation of some high-level abstraction, for example. A reliable supply was more important than low cost.If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude must have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so long as the new model isn't delayed.In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was worth.  Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to figure out who the client is. ConsequencesThat has real consequences for both organizations and individuals. And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; you could just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that was considered advanced. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Colombo number?",

Because depending on the meaning of \"quickly,\" it could actually be very profitable. Notes[1] Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success.  If not, just don't take the first meeting. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones. They continue to improve the technology, and meanwhile their user base grows by word of mouth. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s it was fashionable to design new programming languages. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting.  It would make sense for super-angels to want low valuations if they're hoping to invest in startups that get bought early.  <ImageHere> So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and those the left and right care about, and this can sometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you're not with us, you're against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by  the extreme left.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley. More libraries get written for popular languages, which makes them still more popular. The argument goes like this.  It was a place people went in search of something new.  I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  <ImageHere>  It was a picture of an AS400, and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're not just making a technical decision. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator's.  The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't. That gap between us was not imaginary. Or you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas.  Robert in particular took bribery to the point of treason.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support people answer much the same questions; but once you've written a piece of code you don't need to write it again.  <ImageHere>  When cigarettes first appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through a previously isolated population. So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups, there's no one to invest in them.Not BureaucratsDo you really need the rich people?  Wouldn't it work to have the government invest in the nerds?  No, it would not.  Don't ignore this data point just because it's an outlier.Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures. They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.[19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.  <ImageHere>  And yet if I had to write down everything I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a page.  I believed these things were good because they were admired.It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things you're impressed with. But Rtm was right, as usual. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. Even in Confucius's time it still seems to have been the first duty of the scholar.[10] The bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated by the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about such matters.  If anywhere should be quiet, that should.  I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  None of these companies were even meant to be companies at first.  At about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Tunis number?",

On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Given an initial critical mass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.  This must have affected what they said.  So the question of how to make a silicon valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them to move?Two TypesI think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub: rich people and nerds.   But their tastes can't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\" The thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas, cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them. That's becoming the test of mattering to hackers.There should be online documentation as well.  <ImageHere> No one wants to write (aref a x y) when they could write a[x,y].In this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out of the problem. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it.  A doctor, P.  Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. Startups are as impersonal as physics. I'm not 100% sure it's even a good way to paint.  The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience.  If you're writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was.  <ImageHere> To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible. He was doing something quite different from what a lawyer does, and the difference is embodied in the name.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, while the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up front. What use is it to read all these books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent biography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this question, at least something that made me feel better about it.  <ImageHere>  So it's hard to predict which problems hackers will like, because some become interesting only when the people working on them discover a new kind of solution.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to work where you can actually get work done. A few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear about new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  What does it take to make a silicon valley even here?What it takes is the right people.  Lisp code, after it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not just standards.  They're so desperate for \"content\" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  The organic route is more common.  <ImageHere> Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.July 2006 When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad writers. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. And that is just what tends to happen.  How much is that extra attention worth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another. And because you can't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. At one point in this essay I found that after following a certain thread I ran out of ideas. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Beirut number?",

The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in Boston. And yet they're proposing it anyway. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. Err on the side of the river.  Your boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  They can't pay as much attention to you as a VC on your board could.  <ImageHere> This is everyday life in Palo Alto. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble. For example, the editor could display bottlenecks in red when the programmer edits the source code. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard.  And she too knows the  creative director of GQ.Men's suits are back writes Nicole Ford in Sexbuzz.Com (\"the ultimate men's entertainment magazine\").Dressing down loses appeal as men suit up at the office writes Tenisha Mercer of The Detroit News.  The other is the sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best.These two senses are already quite far apart.  You have to insist on the right things.  <ImageHere>  So this alternative device probably couldn't win on general appeal. Values are what have types, not variables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.5. B. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.     January 2006To do something well you have to like it.  Like the rest of the creative class, they want to live somewhere with personality.What exactly is personality?  I think it's the feeling that each building is the work of a distinct group of people.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn. Another approach would be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done.  <ImageHere>  So don't even try to bluff them.  England in 1800, on.  But as technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading a book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but also to index and even edit them. So, yes, there does seem to be material, even in fast food.What about the other half, ferreting out the unexpected? That may require some natural ability. Values are what have types, not variables, and assigning or binding variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.5.  I regard making money as a boring errand to be got out of the way as soon as possible. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks.  But this is old news to Lisp programmers. A lot of the new applications that will need to be written in the coming years will be  server-based applications.  Statues to be cast in bronze    were modelled in wax.  <ImageHere>  The term \"angel round\" doesn't mean that all the investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the round.  He said he'd originally written something like \"throngs of VCs and biz dev guys\" but had later shortened it just to \"throngs,\" and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into \"throngs of geeks.\"  After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumably be full of geeks, right?Well, no.  Certainly, people who want a deep understanding of something are often driven by curiosity rather than any practical need.  The screen's too shiny, and the disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't make yourself care.So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.  Whoever fed the style section reporter this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by the regular news reporters.[4] The most striking example I know of this type is the \"fact\" that the Internet worm    of 1988 infected 6000 computers. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Jakarta number?",

It's just that if I can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. [1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it. It may be easier to have them if you don't.  In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them. Garbage-collection.6.  He once told a Sunday school class    Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never   took the first drink.  <ImageHere>  I was talking recently to a founder who considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to work for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there. ConsequencesThat has real consequences for both organizations and individuals. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see.  More and more we were starting to hear about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have cycles to spare.  It was simply a fad. They can help you improve your language, but they can also deter you from improving it.  The manual should be thin as well.  The rich people I know drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kind of furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends.  Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.  You can feel the difference between working for a company with 100 employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.  <ImageHere>  And so when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country, there is a tendency to worry that it's sliding back toward becoming another Venezuela.  Whereas when the problems you have to solve are random, they seem like noise. The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish one another's papers. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.  Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of them, because I find new books to read en route.  When you design something for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.That's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently, seems inevitably to corrupt the designer.  Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it.  [2] The average trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine.  <ImageHere>  Instead of laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students, he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100 + 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get the answer, 5050.[2] A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems, and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions.  What makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on.  Their reporters do go out and find their own stories, at least some of the time.  Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple weeks has been trained to click on Back after following a link. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site. School, it was implied, was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.  <ImageHere> He always seems to land on his feet.  Universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So it was in Europe in 1200.  More people are starting startups, but not as many more as could. Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.  We've even had a twin study: West Germany, on;  East Germany, off.  Most days his stack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which supposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after Rtm. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. If we start from the premise that there's no such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.We'd better start by saying what good taste is. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Baghdad number?",

The control systems inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams. cit., p.  But the guys at Google didn't think search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference. Nothing could be better, for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters. H.  It would be suspicious if it didn't meander.The Meander is a river in Asia Minor (aka Turkey).  In the Daddy Model, hard work is in itself deserving.  But for someone at the top of the field, what's the test of doing well?  Runners can at least compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you think you could have run a bit faster.  If you chose technology that way, you'd be running Windows. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them.  <ImageHere> White said, \"good writing is rewriting.\"  I didn't realize this when I was in school.  At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. works not just for evaluating new ideas but also for having them.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view languages as standards.  In fact, it's suspiciously hard to find a field of math that truly has no practical use. Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages are more popular.(Beware of such reasoning. It's practically the standard ending in blog entries--- with the addition of a \"heh\" or an  emoticon, prompted by the all too accurate sense that something is missing.And indeed, a lot of published essays peter out in this same way. It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all.  This was perfectly true.  <ImageHere>  But I've learned never to say never about technology. And it may be more than a question of just solving a problem.  In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney.  The houses are made using the same construction techniques and contain much the same objects. [1]Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately likely to be interesting.  Occasionally I need to give an example of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  Give me a million dollars and I'll figure out what to do.  In every field, technology magnifies differences in productivity. It meant there would be a whole new generation of  essays. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing.   And I don't have to know if I bet on everything just being on the server. 75.[12] A preliminary result, that all metaphysics between Aristotle and 1783 had been a waste of time, is due to I.  <ImageHere>  It's not something you read looking for a specific answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  Indeed, the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to either end of the middle class.  People who fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static. Beeton's Book of Household Management (1880), \"it may be found necessary, in some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility of a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life.\" A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends who didn't.  In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.[16] Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich have better opportunities for education.  Everyone who deals with startups knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent, they won't give you much attention.  <ImageHere>  To make something   good, you have to be thinking, \"wow, this is really great,\" not \"what a piece of shit; those fools will love it.\"Design means making things for humans.  An ordinary laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae.  Silicon Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question.  After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist. Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what he did.  I thought studying philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you're doing math. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from.Perl is a striking example of this idea. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Tokyo number?",

Programs often have to work with existing programs, and this is easier if they're written in the same language, so languages spread from program to program like a virus.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even the VCs and super-angels themselves. If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty.  ....[That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.]Notes[sh] In Shakespeare's own time, serious writing meant theological discourses, not the bawdy plays acted over on the other   side of the river among the bear gardens and whorehouses.The other extreme, the work that seems formidable from the moment it's created (indeed, is deliberately intended to be) is represented by Milton.  What I'm proposing is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you can use it against your opponents.If you work for a big company, this may not be easy.  <ImageHere> I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wanting to like classical music.\" But we're getting closer to the truth.  The PR industry has too.  But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.Reporters like definitive statements. Perl and Common Lisp occupy opposite poles on this question.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten who discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter.  The recording industry hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible.  And the  second could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management.  You also can't tell from their resumes. You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us.  When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.This is especially true in a startup. [4]Paradigms don't just define our present thinking.  <ImageHere> Multics and Common Lisp were big-bang projects, and Unix and MacLisp were organic growth projects.10 Redesign\"The best writing is rewriting,\" wrote E.  There's no consensus yet in the general case.  Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf.  That would be kind of amusing.1. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages.  And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone  till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn't seem correct.  That's a valid point.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our heroes should be.  Kids a certain age would point into the case and say that they wanted yellow.  <ImageHere>  But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup. May 2002)  (This article came about in response to some questions on the LL1 mailing list.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves so they can get the most done. Once the libraries get too big, it can sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write the code yourself.  You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized easily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay  are a good example.  Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better.  That's the really scary part for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but at the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the variation we see is something that more and more fields will see as time goes on.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.  If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit.  <ImageHere> Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. You can observe big new ideas being born all around you right now. The university is just the seed. Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm.  If founders could sell a little stock early, they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger outcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least half million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the    money.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's backlog of shit accumulates.  And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  Indeed, there is even a saying among painters: \"A painting is never finished, you just stop working on it.\"  This idea will be familiar to anyone who has worked on software.Morale is another reason that it's hard to design something for an unsophisticated user.

So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.  Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. \"The spirit of resistance to government,\" Jefferson wrote, \"is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.\"Imagine an American president saying that today. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem. Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher   wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken place, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (the subtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.  <ImageHere>  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is this how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. Fathers tended to adopt the attitude of benevolent kings bestowing largesse, and mothers that of harried bureaucrats, giving in to pressure against their better judgement. I had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. What I got wrong was the idea.  It was the people they never got. And that is in fact the implication of what Eric is saying.As long as that idea is still floating around, I think hackers will be receptive enough to a new Lisp, even if it is called Lisp.  It is a case of the mistaken meeting the outdated.\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,\" Balzac wrote.  And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot.  But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them.  <ImageHere>   Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the      individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using   graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the   reputation of each member. It's practically the standard ending in blog entries--- with the addition of a \"heh\" or an  emoticon, prompted by the all too accurate sense that something is missing.And indeed, a lot of published essays peter out in this same way.  It seems like the only way to judge a hacker is to work with him on something.And this is the reason that high-tech areas  only happen around universities. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers.  At our startup we had  Robert Morris working as a system administrator. They're the two most independent-minded people  I know, and in completely different ways. [3]In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if you're unemployed. The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved.  <ImageHere> But painting was post-rigorous. Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't. \"Not much new\" is a real achievement when you're talking about the most general ideas. But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups.  The topic sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting  paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the conclusion--- uh, what it the conclusion?  I was never sure   about that in high school.  And yet does anyone who was there have any expectation those days will ever return?  I doubt it.  It's what bias means.For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased against female founders. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too.  <ImageHere>  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary.  That first million is just worth so much more than the subsequent ones.  We weren't writing this code for our own amusement. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was.  VCs are quite valuation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are in general, and partly because they don't care that much about the returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to recruit startups for series A rounds later. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Tashkent number?",

If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language from a bad one. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  If you could get the right ten thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo would become Silicon Valley. We needed to get experience as investors. Also, as a general rule, you can at any given time get away with changing more than you think. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  I learned that I don't exist.  His skills are simply much more valuable.I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.  <ImageHere>  But that isn't true.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast. Look at how much any popular language has changed during its life.  The only thing we were good at was writing software. A new concept of variables. In politics, for example, crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound.  Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise around $400k. People would order it because of the name, and were always disappointed. I couldn't see the board from my desk, but I found that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there was a problem with a server.It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automatically detect inefficient algorithms.  The purpose of this article is not to change anyone's mind, but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- people who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it isn't widely used. Palm and RIM haven't a hope. If a sentence doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and you've usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists.  <ImageHere>  People in the Valley aren't automatically impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they pay attention.  But if we make kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more interesting stuff later.  This seems to me one of the most interesting differences between research and design.There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts, but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather than nuclear fusion.  Since high school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as   sources of information. You want to be optimistic and skeptical about two different things. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. You don't have to publish the essay at all, if you can't get it right. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.  It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that you never admit you're wrong.  <ImageHere>  You get those from small additions of whichever quality was missing.  And if you find yourself asking \"should we allow users to do x?\" just  answer \"yes\" whenever you're unsure. It was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  They'll go where life is good.  He has noticed that theoretical knowledge is often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than for any practical need.  But there is little correlation between founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies do.I've read that the same is true in the military — that the swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really tough than the quiet ones.  Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored.  <ImageHere> The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it.  If you  don't and a competitor does, you're in trouble.iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was mathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  It's very valuable in practice to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Chicago number?",

No philosopher ever refuted another, for example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute. Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is in software. Common Lisp might have remained popular if it had been a good scripting language for Unix.  It's a consequence of the tree structure that every large organization is forced to adopt.Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if they avoided tree structure. You'd have to get iPhones out of programmers' hands.  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you can start.  There was no uptake among hackers.  And although the first may be weakening because it's now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever. But elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses, I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.  <ImageHere>  Doing what you love is complicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  Symbols differ from strings in that you can test equality by comparing a pointer.8.  But they're wrong. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.  I think it's because some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.We've now  invested  in enough companies that I've learned a trick for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones: they're the ones I have to keep repeating.So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding.  I'm not proposing that you can fight this powerful force.   But I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great spur to the imagination.  <ImageHere> This isn't quite true. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. If a writer rewrites an essay, people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword.  It's not the kind of place nerds like.Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but no rich people. Another view is that a programming language really isn't a programming language unless it's also the scripting language of something.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know they don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on.  The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in Boston. If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty.  In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications.  <ImageHere>  There started to be a lot more analysis.  But I don't think the bank manager really did.The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was presumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed to.  But there is a deeper reason that hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. [6]Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and not be a student?  I can answer that one for you.  I wasn't trying to meet people; I was just having lunch. Only those who've tried it know how lonely.  You might as well buy Apple.So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could get acquired quickly, that would explain why they'd care about valuations.  I could see the average town was like a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people went in, but no startups came out. [12] Instead of quietly switching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside.  <ImageHere> To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the third or fourth time he's asked to do something; by then, whoever's asking him may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do want whatever they're asking for.Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new things they hear about. Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. And once they had the luxury of curiosity, one of the first things they discovered was what we call \"the classics.\" Imagine if we were visited   by aliens.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know they don't want to sell, they take the meeting. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting.  People tell the craziest lies about me.  [2] The average trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine. \"Normal\" food is terribly bad for you. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Chicago number?",

        "question": "Reply to image-related questions with concise, clear information.\n<ImageHere>  I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people.  If you write enough, it's inevitable you will.  Don't the French realize these aren't startups?Building office buildings for technology companies won't get you a silicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup happens before they want that kind of space. Perl began life as a collection of utilities for generating reports, and only evolved into a programming language as the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger. [9]But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.  Lisp wasn't designed to fix the mistakes in Fortran; it came about more as the byproduct of an attempt to axiomatize computation. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. But when you understand the origins of this sort of \"essay\", you can see where the conclusion comes from.  <ImageHere>   In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you can't be somewhat of a startup hub. Notes[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp, which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system, written in C, which handled orders.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping ice cream.I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it possible for me to buy a computer of my own.  The mere prospect of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on hard problems. If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment business, that might be different.  <ImageHere>  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. [12]Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have reached this stage.  And it's not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas aren't the ones that win.  There's a lesson here: startups beget startups.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups.  We couldn't believe large numbers of people would want to stay in other people's places.  But you can't trust your opinions in the same way about things that change, which could include practically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an earlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against obsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes.  Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  <ImageHere>  They're not Goody Two-Shoes type good.  But it probably wouldn't start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.SirensWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. So learn and use its full range.  In fact what you do (or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman road-builder.  After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist. But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code.  And so all over the country, students are writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget  might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens.With obvious  results.  If you consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate fact is that change is hard to predict.  <ImageHere> It felt like I was doing life right.  Users don't need benchmarks to run fast.  He said to ask about a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage—hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into computers. Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the  Worm that he didn't want his name on the site.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it. This only seems unfair if it comes as a surprise. And in any case I think good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem: you'd soon learn what was expensive.Part of the problem here is social.  The hackers who become famous tend to become famous by random accidents of PR. So it's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those who don't understand this asymmetry.This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lagos number?",

But they don't have to be. Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages all evolved together with some application they were being used to write.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server, the only software that then supported secure http connections.  Disasters are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent that covers what you're doing, your servers keep crashing, you run into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name, a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course.  Many of these people never come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone else created earlier.  <ImageHere>  But that's still a problem for VCs. But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same. Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further.  And whether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  This by itself is not the end of the world.  Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries were drawn on paper with ink wash. A programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular language.  <ImageHere>  And so they're the most valuable sort of fact you can get. And it may be more than a question of just solving a problem.   When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"SplitPerhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer.  So a programmer working as programmers are meant to is always making new things. It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help we could get.  But they're doing it because byte code is a convenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because byte code is in itself a good idea.  Many of the startups we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of startups in general.A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with a valuation cap of $4 million premoney.  <ImageHere>  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values.  That's not what makes startups worth the trouble. S-expressions map nicely onto html, and macros are good at generating it. It did originally come with a system to hack: the Lisp Machine.  It's not just a synonym for annoying. So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual productivity as time goes on.  But once this \"fact\" was out there in print, we could quote it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20% of the online store market.This was roughly true.  <ImageHere>  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to.  Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  If by the next time you need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals your existing investors are sending. So while it's not possible to have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste. But it doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads of each of the observers.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism are true, knows all too well.)One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people in general is that hackers are more  politically incorrect.  Mistake number two.  It's hard to follow, especially when you're young. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Berlin number?",

If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to happen.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders. I spent almost a decade investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do to succeed as a startup investor.  They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth.  They would say that. They're perfectly justified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a waste of time, and eventually go away.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  <ImageHere>  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to decrease most other gaps.Alternative to an AxiomOne often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would increase the income gap between rich and poor.  No one was leaking news of their features to us.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company.  If you want something, you either have to make it, or do something of equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it. I think we just have to face the fact that elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack.  Perhaps it's because startups are less of a zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed by competitors. They're not just experimental error. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was mathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  They don't know how many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have done well if they'd survived.  <ImageHere> So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and those the left and right care about, and this can sometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you're not with us, you're against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by  the extreme left. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.[4] In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g.  Look at this, for example.\"There are two things you have to do to make people pause.  [1]   And VCs have been provoked by their arrival into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  If you write in Latin, no one can understand you.  <ImageHere>  The story of creation in the Bible is not just a Judeo-Christian concept; it's roughly what everyone must have believed since before people were people.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. The internet is doing it to the essay.The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but that there's a lot left to discover.  It never gets any easier.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree.  This is easier in most other fields. Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either of them.  There's an idea that has turned out to be widely applicable.  They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't leave.  <ImageHere>  The only credible contender is Android.  You have to imagine being two people.The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.  The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment.  Read their job listings. Gay marriage, for or against?  This group says one thing. In young hackers, optimism predominates.  They work well enough in everyday life that you don't notice.  In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers.  John McPhee wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something in the process.Notes[1] This domain expertise could be in another field.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC investments is dictated by the structure of VC funds, not the needs of startups. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they really love it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bratislava number?",

And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic.  If you wanted more wealth, you could make it.This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  They confuse it with money. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users.  <ImageHere> He couldn't build them because he couldn't afford the components.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to.  But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure. They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect \"intellectual property\" as a threat to the intellectual freedom they need to do their job.  Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid.  When we were making the rounds of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software companies didn't win by writing great software, but through brand, and dominating channels, and doing the right deals.They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  Traditionally the student is the audience, not the teacher; the student's job is not to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material. For expert hackers, that really is a problem.  They think that there is a fixed amount of it.  <ImageHere> So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems expert that he wanted to design a really good programming language. The libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits together like the parts in a fine camera.  Selina Tobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.  We did that as an inside joke when we started YC.  And when wealth is something you're given, then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally. To change the interface both have to agree to change it at once.  For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. An optimism shield has to be pierced too. In fact, the book can start as online documentation.   There is no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.  Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver: people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies, and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  <ImageHere>  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.[4] In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g.  We no longer admire the sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago. Now to people he meets at parties he's a real poet. You're not sacrificing anything if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely to succeed if you wait.  But most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than underestimating it.  You have to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised.That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  You have to be extra skeptical about things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that category.[3] In practice \"sufficiently expert\" doesn't require one to be recognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any case.  <ImageHere> [2]Such ideas are not guaranteed to work.  If you're writing something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. Their format is convenient, and the de facto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfect filter.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it.  It's the nature of programming languages to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use. So the language probably must already be installed on the computer you're using. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Dubai number?",

It hadn't occurred to me till then that those horrible things we had to write in school were even connected to what I was doing now.  But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done much that was like being a startup founder.  Most people treat the words  thesis and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it.I'm not complaining that we blur these two words together.  Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative.[4] Philosophy is like math's ne'er-do-well brother.  But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related.  Hiring too fast is by far the biggest killer of startups that raise money. So if you want to design a popular language, you either have to supply more than a language, or you have to design your language to replace the scripting language of some existing system.Common Lisp is unpopular partly because it's an orphan.  <ImageHere>  It was just like ...  If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses of $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that would bear comparison with any in the world.  Of course he wouldn't program in machine language. Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would take.So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing them. If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance.  <ImageHere>  which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.January 2003(This article is derived from a keynote talk at the fall 2002 meeting of NEPLS.)Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that Americans like to begin a conversation by asking \"what do you do?\" I've never liked this question.  The teacher doesn't.  I tried asking myself what word I'd use to describe the feeling the Valley radiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.Notes[1] I'm not saying it's impossible to succeed in a city with few other startups, just harder.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience.  <ImageHere>  When we got to the yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran into Yuri Sagalov.  But you couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition if the students did well they would never come back.[7] Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done.  It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either of them.  The more (and more varied) experience a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  But I know my motives aren't virtuous.  A few years before, there was no such thing as a freelance programmer. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run.  <ImageHere> [1]If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. 75.[12] A preliminary result, that all metaphysics between Aristotle and 1783 had been a waste of time, is due to I.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them, at least.Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory in one lifetime. When you approach the problem from the direction of the arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of test. ConsequencesThat has real consequences for both organizations and individuals. If there were a little guy running around inside the computer executing our programs, he would probably have as long and plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal government employee. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Khartoum number?",

Notes[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved for the language, suggesting that at least some of the designers intended to have more syntax in the future.One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp occurs in format strings; format is a language in its own right, and that language is not Lisp. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC.  But the problem with scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know they don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  A quality that's inborn will obviously be more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience, and thus might vary in the course of a study. A new concept of variables.  <ImageHere> But anything to get users.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know.  Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools.  But when you lose that protection, e.g.  That no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.  [11] By the nineteenth century that had changed. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some competitor tried to spam our web designers.  If you had one, you were rich.  When people say \"Web 2.0\" now, I have some idea what they mean.  It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  <ImageHere>  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that. All other things being equal, no one wants to begin a program with a bunch of declarations.  A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things.  Unlike high tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it turns out to be a mistake.This is why hackers worry. We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%.  I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people. The path it has discovered, winding as it is, represents the most economical route to the sea.The river's algorithm is simple.  The expected value of a startup is the percentage chance it's Google.  <ImageHere>   On the surface it feels like the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major is missing. Back when students focused mainly on getting a job after college, they thought at least a little about how the courses they took might look to an employer. It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data. \"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  But he turned out to be mistaken.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the variation we see is something that more and more fields will see as time goes on. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true._____ How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like casual conversation.  That's what happened with domestic servants. I'm inclined now to think it was the salt. [5]Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear.  <ImageHere> They continue to improve the technology, and meanwhile their user base grows by word of mouth.  Not intelligence-- determination.This is a little depressing. In ancient times it covered a broad range of topics, comparable in scope to our \"scholarship\" (though without the methodological implications).  It was just like ... (I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c), that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it. And those are the users you need to win.In \"How to Become a Hacker,\" Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something like Latin or Greek — a language you should learn as an intellectual exercise, even though you won't actually use it:    Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience   you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make   you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you   never actually use Lisp itself a lot.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural to me, except possibly for math.  The company is ultimately doomed. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kigali number?",

Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.   When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"SplitPerhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence. [1]The Secret WeaponEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\" and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn.  I managed to get him to agree to a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name. About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. They can afford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding the launch has the side effect of making them celebrities.  <ImageHere>  There started to be a lot more analysis.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry, all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in  grad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash   out partially in the Series A round.  Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Fear the Right Things.Another thing I find myself saying a lot is \"don't worry.\"  Actually, it's more often \"don't worry about this; worry about that instead.\" Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong things.Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem. It turns out to have quite broad applications—for example, in genetic algorithms and even product design.  But prudence can't tell me what sentence to write next. They raise their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible.  <ImageHere> In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. NaughtinessThough the most successful founders are usually good people, they tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  That way we can avoid applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant for wisdom.  It has to be a place where investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors are nerds themselves.  But you can go too far in any law, and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work.  It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists.  <ImageHere>  At least, that was what had happened to the language he had designed.What does make a language popular?  Do popular languages deserve their popularity?  Is it worth trying to define a good programming language?  How would you do it?I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking  at hackers, and learning what they want. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. With Apple that seems less the case.  ....[That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.]Notes[sh] In Shakespeare's own time, serious writing meant theological discourses, not the bawdy plays acted over on the other   side of the river among the bear gardens and whorehouses.The other extreme, the work that seems formidable from the moment it's created (indeed, is deliberately intended to be) is represented by Milton. Expert hackers  can tell a good language when they see one, and they'll use it.   But for some reason we treat this skill differently.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to do.  This may be an impossible dream.  <ImageHere> I certainly did. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me.  It would be a waste of time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial town like Detroit or Philadelphia by trying to encourage startups. They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are the source of America's wealth and power.Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be obeyed.  The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.How would the government decide who's a startup investor?  The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  Doing what you love is complicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  No one after reading Aristotle's Metaphysics does anything differently as a result.

Northern Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it).

You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you can't be somewhat of a startup hub.  <ImageHere>  \"Unfair,\" they cry, when one sibling gets more than another.In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents. [14]The same pattern has played out in industry after industry.  Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each? It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who want to work that hard.The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that should be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the amount of wealth that can be created. And how colorful their stories were.  And it seems even odder to say that it's unjust that certain kinds of work are underpaid.  To get the same rate of return, the VC would have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x.  More often people who do great things have careers with the trajectory of a ping-pong ball.

I think hacking is more like architecture.  A quality that's inborn will obviously be more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience, and thus might vary in the course of a study. Their lives are short too.  And so they're the most valuable sort of fact you can get.  I was talking recently to a founder who considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to work for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.  That's why the Apple I used a TV as a monitor.[4] Several people I talked to mentioned how much they liked the iPhone SDK.  They control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce.  <ImageHere> Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort.  It probably takes at least a generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England). Brevity is always attractive to hackers, and never more so than in a program they expect to turn out in an hour.6 LibrariesOf course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it.  But why would they be looking for those?   Because depending on the meaning of \"quickly,\" it could actually be very profitable.  Since people interested in the latter are interested in it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  But what if the person in the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball?

There is definitely not a total order either of works or of people's ability to judge them.  And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Gay marriage, for or against?  This group says one thing.  But the problem with scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  Don't ask them any unnecessary questions.  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.  You see a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside.If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well, there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery. Expert hackers  can tell a good language when they see one, and they'll use it.  <ImageHere> When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you can always tell.  The information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.  My professor friends, when they're deciding where they'd like to work, consider one thing above all: the quality of the other faculty. I couldn't see the board from my desk, but I found that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there was a problem with a server.It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automatically detect inefficient algorithms.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at age 14.  When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good.  I'd give Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge another shot in college. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. And it has to stay popular to stay good.  If companies stuck to their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages, and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff.  <ImageHere>  In print they had to cut the last item because they didn't have room.)1. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.[6] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way.  That's the recipe for getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so on.  They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this. [2]  I know if something major happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it    will show up there.  Java has since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996 the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software. Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group.  <ImageHere>  In software, my   rule is: always have working code. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something in the process.Notes[1] This domain expertise could be in another field.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd written years before that might say something I needed to remember, if I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something to read.   That idea is not exactly novel.  So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you'll have. They rush to develop a product, launch it with great publicity, and immediately (they hope) have a large user base.Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email, sure, you might as well open it.  We take these for granted now. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. It has to be there.  <ImageHere>  Technically the term \"high-level language\" doesn't mean anything very definite.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.The founders sometimes think they know. The conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is the real one.  Mostly we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we then trade for the forms of wealth we want. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.  VCs are quite valuation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are in general, and partly because they don't care that much about the returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to recruit startups for series A rounds later. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.  And not merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs; he had to decide what Apple's next products should be. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Rabat number?",

This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  Look at this, for example.\"There are two things you have to do to make people pause.  It would not work well for a language where you have to declare variables before using them, for example.  Wrong. I'd build a subset that could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers were finally fast enough.  They control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce.  But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident. Prose can be rewritten over and over until you're happy with it. But you can rarely get it down to zero.  <ImageHere>  In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise is caused by the fan.At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off. Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages are more popular.(Beware of such reasoning. Why? I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest.  People don't so much enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly.  If a design represents an idea that   fits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the user's head too.Related:  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives, because that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years.  <ImageHere>  Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh.In our world some of the most characteristic solutions are not far removed from practical jokes.  Most are only allowed to invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willing to act as lead investor.Not BuildingsIf you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings.  You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed.   I've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people's sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers and magazines. You can ask it of even the most unobservant people, and it will extract information they didn't even know they were recording.  They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by intelligence. Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an increasingly important component of programming languages.  In most American cities the center has been abandoned, and the growth, if any, is in the suburbs.  <ImageHere>  But an illusion it was.  Most people implicitly believe something like this about their opinions. And so interfaces tend not to change at all, which is a problem because they tend to be one of the most ad hoc parts of any system.One solution here might be to design systems so that interfaces are horizontal instead of vertical — so that modules are always vertically stacked strata of abstraction.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC investments is dictated by the structure of VC funds, not the needs of startups.   Will that increase the gap between rich and the poor?  Depends which gap you mean.Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps.  If Ron Conway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this..  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.  But that's not the same as just being able to do what you want, like you could before.A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that they're less stressful to raise.  <ImageHere>  So what if some of the money would go to the   founders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is unthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work growing the company. Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP.  The word \"regressive\" as applied to tax rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything regressive be good?[9] \"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.  And because this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive to it. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the same way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the corresponding property. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seoul number?",

Instead you get into a sort of flow.  It was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie.  It's supposed to be about the ultimate truths. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them.  They're going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however. Nothing is deprecated, or retained for compatibility.  This idea is at least nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense-- indeed, in the very word thesis.  They make investment decisions quickly, like angels. [2] For boys, at least, certain kinds of horrors are fascinating.  EBay didn't win by paying less for servers than their competitors.Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a growth industry in the mid twentieth century.  What worries him about Google is not the power of their brand, but the fact that they have better hackers.  <ImageHere>  In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house on a little island off the coast of Maine.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked at the works of their predecessors and said in effect \"why can't you be more like your brother?\"  Russell was still saying the same thing 2300 years later.Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy the imprecise half. If founders' instincts already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us. My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing will move from the desktop onto remote servers.  The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't.  If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.What I find myself repeating is \"pump out features.\"  And this rule isn't just for the initial stages.  <ImageHere>  We had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of my parents smoked.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken.  A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business.  And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. I think we may have made a mistake in thinking that hackers are turned off by Lisp's strangeness.  Founders never really liked giving up as much equity as VCs wanted. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.  Even a company with 100 people will feel different from one with 1000.Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom.  What's important about startups is the speed.  <ImageHere>  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  So what if some of the money would go to the   founders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is unthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work growing the company.  The point of programming languages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being  overwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal than others. I think it might be better to follow the model of Tcl, and supply the Lisp together with a complete system for supporting server-based applications.  Kill-or-cure strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint.  This had only recently been declared a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative technique didn't work. I was right about that part.  But the next time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer to be their chief technical officer.  <ImageHere>  Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely. So learn and use its full range. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their sample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of startup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future. So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of course.  Apple leaves no room there.  What we call \"metaphysics\" Aristotle called \"first philosophy.\"[9] Some of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.[10] Sokal, Alan, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,\" Social Text 46/47, pp.  The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.

Read their job listings. Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.[6] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. (ed.), Slavery in Classical Antiquity, Heffer, 1964.[5] Eratosthenes (276—195 BC) used shadow lengths in different cities to estimate the Earth's circumference.  It's why the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo, for example.  This doesn't mean you have to make something.  I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to contradict it.  It's very valuable in practice to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand.  <ImageHere>  That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.1.  And while it  makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies,  studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about  hitting outliers, are not one of them.  [5]In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by showing them. And yet they're proposing it anyway. Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.Over in the arts, things are very different. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably the best person for the job.I don't think there is any solution to this problem. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it could be falsified. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the tricks are for convincing investors. I'd never imagined it was even possible.  <ImageHere>  No one complains when a few people surpass all the rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.Why?  The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other skill. But it doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads of each of the observers. So I remember his exact words very clearly.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for.  Circumstances being what they were, companies would have been stupid to insist on paying them so little.If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the Internet Bubble.  Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.I've written a whole essay on this, so I won't repeat it all here.  <ImageHere>  The government has responded with draconian laws to protect intellectual property. He was doing something quite different from what a lawyer does, and the difference is embodied in the name.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. It was difficult to give away. [16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Though arguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose them are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts in political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get legislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon.  You also can't tell from their resumes.  And as pros they do this more than you.  And I think there will need to be support for it at the language level. In one day it got 30,000 page views.  <ImageHere> They're more like examples of Robert Frost's \"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances of good design together, but within each individual project, one person has to be in control.I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think of everything.  I used to think running was a better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time. The people who are interested in art learn about it for themselves, and those who aren't don't.  And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented. And that means, perhaps surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task: a program to automate some system administration task, or generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format to another.  These things don't get discovered that often.  Those things you have to write in school are not only not essays, they're one of the most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have to jump through in school. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Colombo number?",

The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various individual philosophers have said about different topics over the years.  Both self-control and experience have this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively.  Each is, by itself, enough to kill you.  You can't just treat a patient's symptoms. But because they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing to investors. Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders, a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the long term than one who passes.[8] The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations is that we're not professional negotiators, and don't want to turn into them.[9] There are two ways to do  work you love: (a) to make money, then work on what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on stuff you love.  <ImageHere> Wearing suits, we're told, will make us  3.6 percent more productive.BuzzWhere the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of \"buzz.\"  They usually feed the same story to     several different publications at once. Design, as Matz has said, should follow the principle of least surprise.  But it was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who felt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about forgetting, though.  Founders arriving at Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  At the other extreme you work at something till you make enough not to  have to work for money again.The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because it requires a deliberate choice.  All the people majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain knowledge.  <ImageHere>  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants out of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the test drive.  Which is exactly how I'd describe the way lions seem in the wild.Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment—and in particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to programmers. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other.  Java has since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996 the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software.  Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have. The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved.  You can't just treat a patient's symptoms. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste.  <ImageHere> When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML.  And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages (especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude of a governess: they try to prevent you from doing things that they think aren't good for you. The next generation of computer technology has often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing what they expected to be the next generation of business computer. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives.  In a series A round they want a third of your company, if they can get it.  These seedlings are worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the economy. Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  One thing is certain: the question is a complex one.  <ImageHere>  April 2009I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.  By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. That's   the trouble with fleas, they only like the bizarre stuff.  It is true that all they really care about is doing interesting work. And yet there is undeniably a grim satisfaction in hunting down certain sorts of bugs.May 2003If Lisp is so great, why don't more people use it?  I was     asked this question by a student in the audience at a  talk I gave recently.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Their tastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a lot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist destinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.  If you buy a custom-made car, something will always be breaking.  [2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Belgrade number?",

Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users.  In the process of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that \"2.0\" referred to. They raise their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible. I think you should always do this when you can.  Except he didn't.  Users don't need benchmarks to run fast.  I think it's because some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.We've now  invested  in enough companies that I've learned a trick for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones: they're the ones I have to keep repeating.So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding.  <ImageHere> Surely it's better if everything just works.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a bigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything you can do to make programs shorter is good. Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long touchdown pass.  And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry, all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in  grad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash   out partially in the Series A round.  <ImageHere>  Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin. [1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions, and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. And so once university English departments were established in the late nineteenth century, the 'riting component of the 3 Rs  was morphed into English. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last.  To say that a certain kind of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want the wrong things.Well, of course people want the wrong things. They don't want to bet the company on Betamax. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards.  <ImageHere> For the next couple years I was on a roll. And more importantly, the founder who has made something users love is the one who will go on to succeed after raising the money.Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the system stops working when you start a startup.  One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's full of bugs.  People who like New York will pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the cool people are really cool.  I call it the design paradox.  You won't need to advertise, because your users will do it for you.This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are.  The word is used more often in the former than the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more common than brilliant ones.Believe it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are also connected.  <ImageHere> The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it. You're helping them, and you're writing. You don't get to pick and choose. With the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately large percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that the very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is identical to the question, how do you design a good programming language?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting question.3.  Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it?  If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly startling results. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kuala Lumpur number?",

The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.  Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid.  An undergrad who gets something published feels like a star.  And to reproduce that you need those people.UniversitiesThe exciting thing is, all you need are the people.  And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded yet.  Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.  <ImageHere>  (The use of the term \"recitation\" for sections in some colleges is a fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that they're too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.DifferentI deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it's worth being wise.  The information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available. You don't see all the false starts.  If you're sufficiently good at generating your own morale, you can survive without external encouragement.  An essayist can't have quite as little foresight as a river.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  They shut down a few months later.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk about the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an  odd idea.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked at the works of their predecessors and said in effect \"why can't you be more like your brother?\"  Russell was still saying the same thing 2300 years later.Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy the imprecise half.  <ImageHere>  If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it.  It's more efficient just to give them the diffs. But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned.  You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them.  Often as not these large   investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing it.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we'd been.  Hardy's boast that number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.  <ImageHere>  It's often mistakenly believed that medieval universities were mostly seminaries. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing.  I didn't realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the change.  But as one VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a million, \"I don't know what we're going to do. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages all evolved together with some application they were being used to write. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. In the past, a competitor might use patents to prevent you from selling a copy of something they made, but they couldn't prevent you from taking one apart to see how it worked.   So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.  Then I had kids.  <ImageHere>  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is this how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter.  Many of the most popular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the user the message: this is our site, not yours.  It's like eating jam when you know you should be eating fruit.There is a point where I'll do without books.  There were ashtrays everywhere. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something in the process.Notes[1] This domain expertise could be in another field. That's how programmers read code anyway: when indentation says one thing and delimiters say another, we go by the indentation. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seattle number?",

But here's a related suggestion that goes with the grain instead of against it: that universities establish a writing major.  But any application can be interesting if it poses novel technical challenges. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. Whether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors, it probably isn't), it tended to pervade the atmosphere of early universities. What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  In a competitive situation, that's an advantage.  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second.  These things don't get discovered that often. They may not care at all about questions that the left and right both think are terribly important.  <ImageHere>  But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the growth never comes. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning.  That was not, probably, how McCarthy thought of it. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really fast.\" Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Joe Gebbia, Jessica Livingston, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.February 2007A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.  <ImageHere>  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint.  But you can at least not repress them.  99% of people reading Ulysses are thinking \"I'm reading Ulysses\" as they do it.  But this seems the exception. In the first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able to solve it. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels. [14]The same pattern has played out in industry after industry. It's  lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?  That seems like saying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.The appearance of the word \"unjust\" here is the unmistakable spectral signature of the Daddy Model. But what you tell him doesn't matter, so long as    it's interesting. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.  <ImageHere> And they are right.It is by poking about inside current technology that hackers get ideas for the next generation.  The goal he announces in the Metaphysics seems one worth pursuing: to discover the most general truths.  But if you're looking for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.  What makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously they still view office space as a badge of rank.  The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment. There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system, at the core of which was something called an inference engine.  <ImageHere>  If you write in Latin, no one can understand you.  But although I started using it out of loyalty to the home team, I've become a genuine addict.  Each group tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals that humans were designed to work in.  None of these companies were even meant to be companies at first. Not fast, but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you can't be somewhat of a startup hub. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do.  You can do this if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,    the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested the bricks.Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lagos number?",

But Rtm was right, as usual.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of them. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU.  But I was never able to figure out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was killing all the potential startups.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.  Wufoo was based in Tampa and they succeeded. C is like this. It might be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the language, and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in bottlenecks. My God did I love working on that program. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.  But it's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.  <ImageHere>  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.  If you're hoping to hit the next Google, you shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like casual conversation. For expert hackers, that really is a problem.  Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C.  That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds.  [3]  Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters for little microcomputers because Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  What we call \"metaphysics\" Aristotle called \"first philosophy.\"[9] Some of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.[10] Sokal, Alan, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,\" Social Text 46/47, pp.  <ImageHere>  I think it's mainly not having to have a three hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating the Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the construction industry.

Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control. The word \"paradigm\" is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted. The point is not just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading.  For example, if you find yourself packing a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop and think about that.For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and a pen.There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music, or tea, but I can live without them.  <ImageHere>  They won't be offended.  Designing systems of great mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us than pandering to human weaknesses.   PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" was coined.2. I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. I'll make them all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll just be able to say: number four! 1. You have to be able to think  how hard can it be? with one half of your brain while thinking  it will never work with the other.The trick is to realize that there's no real contradiction here. [7] My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a startup hub.  They work on something till they think it's finished, then they release it.  <ImageHere>  There was not much point in making more than you could hide. What popularity it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the scripting language of MIT.  The four causes: open source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot cheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest expenses. The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more because he grasps the underlying principles.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing that's where they're headed.There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise more money.  It's probably inevitable that philosophy will suffer by comparison, because there's no lower bound to its precision.

We don't call it procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working.[5] Several people have told me they like the iPad because it lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would be too conspicuous.

I'm not 100% sure it's even a good way to paint.  For example, many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers.  What's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.  [5] When you get to the end of the experts, look for the client. Here's a clue. Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher   wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken place, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (the subtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored.  <ImageHere>  If you want to define a plus for a new type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function to add them.

They're like someone stuck in an abusive relationship.  The assassin has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks the president's route. But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same.  For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby.  <ImageHere> In a real essay you're writing for yourself.  But it's certainly possible to do things that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you can probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.  Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C.  Users had been climbing in through   the window for years before Apple finally moved the door.[5] Hint: the way to create a web-based alternative to Office may not be to write every component yourself, but to establish a protocol for web-based apps to share a virtual home directory spread across multiple servers.    And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus group than hackers, because they come closest of any group I know to embodying it. Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are like. School, it was implied, was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.  Words seem to work, just as Newtonian physics seems to.  <ImageHere> I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. I even wrote a couple that  weren't about startups. But it's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are, because it's hard to compare their work. 217-252.Abstract-sounding nonsense seems to be most attractive when it's aligned with some axe the audience already has to grind. But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those that made up the language itself.  But you can imagine what it would do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in The New Yorker. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible for my actions.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Budapest number?",

But the two meanings are connected.  It happens naturally to anyone who does good work.  And there is a role for mathematical elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering the childhood trauma that prevented him from singing). You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding.I had always liked looking at paintings.  You may have as many as five or ten releases a day.  The government has responded with draconian laws to protect intellectual property.  They're doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big, bureaucratic companies. Then the interface will tend to be owned by one of them. So one can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is how to pick it.  <ImageHere> The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard.  In such situations it's helpful to have a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know. And yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions. But they may not realize that such laws will do more harm than good.Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night, I'd want to go out and investigate.  Apple made microcomputers because that's what Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.  A good PR firm won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.If anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters.  <ImageHere> Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages (especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude of a governess: they try to prevent you from doing things that they think aren't good for you.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Maybe the best way to put it is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating doughnuts.Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be working in a way that's more natural for humans.I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that I'd only seen in zoos before. It doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to try designing a good language.  Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid of it too. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example.  It was impressive even to ask the questions they did.  As we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  <ImageHere>  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken.  On their job listing page, they say that one of their \"core values'' is \"Don't be evil.'' From a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a statement would merely be eccentric. Just look for a reasonable domain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.If you're nice, as well as wise, you won't merely resist attacking such people, but encourage them.  Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas, you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students. vii.39) says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was 700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis, but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own freedom.Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices.  <ImageHere>   On the surface it feels like the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major is missing. If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you have more freedom of choice.Which route should you take?  That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your lifetime) for what you want to do. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you. Which means that before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've already subjected them to an excessively strict filter. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard.

For example, the Reuters article   that got picked up by USA Today in September 2004. But I don't think that physical books are outmoded yet.  They don't want to have to travel to attend board meetings, and in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub.The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause startups to form around them, and those draw in more startups through acquisitions.  (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't have understood why:  \"If they were that smart they'd already be programming in Lisp.\"[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care about.  <ImageHere> I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything else.  What it means for a selection process to be biased against applicants of type x is that it's harder for them to make it through.  They're each only a great university short of becoming a silicon valley, if they wanted to.TimeA great university near an attractive town.  <ImageHere>  So a programmer working as programmers are meant to is always making new things.  So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.[7] The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer.  And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character.  They're going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.  I have a general idea of the direction I want to go in, and I choose the next topic with that in mind.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created    for other people to use.If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are that you're not designing something good, even for idiots. So if you can eliminate the theory that the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent, its implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to evidence that it's exciting. I have never heard hygienic macros explained in one sentence.  <ImageHere>   With a tractor an energetic farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team of horses. And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a motivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially cash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you are now competing directly with Google.  When you're just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be  able to set x to some value and then start doing things to x. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee.  Angels are individual rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called super-angels.  <ImageHere>  Three months later they're transformed: they have so much more  confidence that they seem as if they've grown several inches taller. There will always be both supply and demand.  MIT yielded Route 128. A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone. It was future startup founders.  But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're bad.The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Hackers would think a lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string libraries and good OS support.7 SyntaxCould a language with Lisp's syntax, or more precisely, lack of syntax, ever become popular? I don't know the answer to this question. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Belgrade number?",

School, it was implied, was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left.  Reddit now has almost half a million unique visitors a month.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree.  A physicist friend recently told me half his department was on Prozac.  But the real problem for Microsoft wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.  Before ITA (who wrote the software inside Orbitz), the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it was one of the most boring applications imaginable. You're growing 7x a year.  There's a market for writing that sounds impressive and can't be disproven. You see it in sponsored research too.  <ImageHere>  Apple made microcomputers because that's what Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.  In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome, his zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to vote the death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason trials that punctuated Henry's erratic matrimonial progress made him an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property.\"Stone, Lawrence, Family and Fortune: Studies in Aristocratic Finance in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, Oxford University Press, 1973, p. I had plenty of respect for theory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. [19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it.  <ImageHere>  And the reason everyone doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower. A reliable supply was more important than low cost.If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude must have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so long as the new model isn't delayed.In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was worth.  The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but neither was expected to invent anything.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself I.  They let their acquaintance drift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they had a lot in common with.For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote was Sergey Brin, and vice versa. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last.  <ImageHere> I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their sample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of startup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future.  Seneca (Ep.  In a traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC fund takes a seat on your board.  Angels and super-angels tend not to like uncapped notes. An interactive language, with a command-line interface, is more available than one that you have to compile and run separately.  [13] Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about how words worked. You can write programs to solve common problems with very little code.  That language didn't even support recursion.  You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them.  Then you want to do something else—even something mindless.  This (a) helps them pick the right startups, and (b) means they can supply advice and connections as well as money.  But any application can be interesting if it poses novel technical challenges.  <ImageHere> I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June.  If anyone should know this, Apple should.  There is something very American about Feynman breaking into safes during the Manhattan Project. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way.  [8] Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had to be useless.The Metaphysics is mostly a failed experiment.  He thought for a second, and said ok.  They gave it a name that was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas. TryShould you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound pretty hard.  Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca.

It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing.  Technically the term \"high-level language\" doesn't mean anything very definite.  If you stop eating jam, fruit starts to taste better.So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip. Do not start a startup in college. \"Look at those goddamn fleas, jabbering   about some disease they'll see once in their lifetimes. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months.  <ImageHere>  If you're writing something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. He never did any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this is exactly the way the best startups get started.So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on \"entrepreneurship.\" It's the classic version of college as education for its own sake.  But don't be discouraged. At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them.  <ImageHere>  You don't build a silicon valley; you let one grow.NerdsIf you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with personality.  Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back?  Because PR firms tell  them to.  That was the point of creating it.  Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C.  No one was leaking news of their features to us. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language.  And the success of companies, and countries, will depend increasingly on how they deal with it.If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  <ImageHere>  But you can always make them break if you push them far enough.I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the central fact of philosophy. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. You don't see all the false starts.  He thought for a second, and said ok. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth spending a lot to market it.If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you think most will choose?It's the same with work.  <ImageHere>   In painting, for example, all other things being equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than one without. The latest hot language, Python, is a watered-down Lisp with infix syntax and no macros.  Don't the French realize these aren't startups?Building office buildings for technology companies won't get you a silicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup happens before they want that kind of space. Notes[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. So if you want to design a popular language, you either have to supply more than a language, or you have to design your language to replace the scripting language of some existing system.Common Lisp is unpopular partly because it's an orphan. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows that pretty clearly.  And they will.  Most people who publish online write what they write for the simple reason that they want to.  Now they're rapidly running out of runway. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Colombo number?",

History is full of examples of young people who were working on important problems that no one else at the time thought were important, and in particular that their parents didn't think were important.  <ImageHere>  And so it became synonymous with California nuttiness.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing, given people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it is certainly more efficient.[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was. Indeed, you can ask it in real time.  But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python or Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would outsource their development to India. And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects. This is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum.  <ImageHere> At the other end of the continuum are languages like Ada and Pascal, models of propriety that are good for teaching and not much else.5 Throwaway ProgramsTo be attractive to hackers, a language must be good for writing the kinds of programs they want to write. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing.  To programmers, \"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer wants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses.   We were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible.When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth.  You need this for everyone: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees.  By then it was merely a tradition.  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work.  <ImageHere>  What we ought to look at, if we want to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own. S-expressions map nicely onto html, and macros are good at generating it.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions.What I'm going to talk about today is what your target looks like from the back. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data.  <ImageHere>  The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.  Meaning that when the note converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other.  In reality, bugs like ours get through all the   time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,   leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work.   Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the      individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using   graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the   reputation of each member. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Thimphu number?",

(The philosophy's there, but it's woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.) If you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loud to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen.4 HackabilityThere is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being able to do what you want. [sh] And so good writers (just you wait and see who's still in print in 300 years) are less likely to have readers turned    against them by clumsy, self-appointed tour guides. They must hear developers complaining. Corn SyrupA group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake tribe. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too.  <ImageHere>  You can do this if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,    the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested the bricks.Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged.  Plant it in the wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.To spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that has attractions other than the university.  But it's an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal. Over time, successive new programming languages have taken more and more features from Lisp.  <ImageHere> And those that did evolve this way are probably still written in whatever language they were first written in, because it's rare for a program to be ported, except for political reasons. Prose has readers, but software has users.  The word \"regressive\" as applied to tax rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything regressive be good?[9] \"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.  [16]That sounds a preposterous claim to make. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part.  Of course he wouldn't program in machine language.  It seems to me too mild to describe what's happening as merely not-doing-work. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time.  <ImageHere>  That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you to stop looking.  He said he has learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath.  The threshold may be whether what you write has a title. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time leads to discontentment.That's particularly worth remembering. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it.  <ImageHere> Hackers are lazy, in the same way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: they hate anything extraneous. When I walked into the final, the main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions would turn up on the exam.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of detective novels.  Certainly they'll learn more.  It does at least seem to be closing, not widening.Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming that their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it is.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online.  In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums of money for building the most trivial things. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Dubai number?",

All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important job better than other languages.History offers some encouragement. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories.  There used to be two sharply differentiated types of investors: angels and venture capitalists.  They're not Goody Two-Shoes type good.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are.One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.  That's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  <ImageHere>  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll have almost as much freedom as the founders.  The houses are made using the same construction techniques and contain much the same objects.  \"Actually it's structural.\"In other words, the readers are leaving, and they're not coming back. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix.  Indeed, they're bad in a particular way: they tend to peter out. 92.[15] Frankfurt, Harry, On Bullshit,  Princeton University Press, 2005.[16] Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any particular truths you'll learn.  The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't. [5] And the reason we do is that they've been diverging. It is, alas, an atrociously bad one.One way to describe this situation is to say that a language isn't judged on its own merits. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write about.The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication.  <ImageHere> These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands between them.  It is also palpably short.  They are a perennial topic of heated discussion on Slashdot.  He has since relaxed a bit on that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the course of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire PhD.  That's a valid point. Notes[1] I've also heard them called \"Mini-VCs\" and \"Micro-VCs.\" I don't know which name will stick.There were a couple predecessors.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken. But what a difference it makes to be able to. If everything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of m.  School has trained them to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  So unless you're fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job career.  <ImageHere>  Surely that field, at least, is tapped out.  The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. If a writer rewrites an essay, people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword.  What it means for a selection process to be biased against applicants of type x is that it's harder for them to make it through.  Universities with x departments will subscribe to the journals. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish.  [8] Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had to be useless.The Metaphysics is mostly a failed experiment.  <ImageHere>  I think what's happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological leverage.  Rate of return is what matters in investing—not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Design, as Matz has said, should follow the principle of least surprise. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even be that for long.  And you could do that for surprisingly little.  But what is a novelist to do?Whereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives, there's an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every time. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from.Perl is a striking example of this idea.  How are we to develop new technology if we can't study current technology to figure out how to improve it?Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bangalore number?",

Perhaps it's because startups are less of a zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed by competitors. Common Lisp might have remained popular if it had been a good scripting language for Unix. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software.  It's just that if I can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next.  Others arrive wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever mistake caused it to accept them. The language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work, rather than as a way of telling you what to do.  <ImageHere>  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves rich.  There is a lot more to discover.Notes [1] In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite some progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize a small percentage of statements.  If you wanted to make pages that looked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  Founders never really liked giving up as much equity as VCs wanted.  And even then they rarely said so outright.If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little progress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the Renaissance.In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it was not only acceptable to produce works like the Metaphysics, but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a class of people called philosophers.  <ImageHere>  That is certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam's prosperity 400 years ago.A lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though. It wasn't that they were stupid. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996.  But in practice investors discount merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a higher growth rate to impress investors.[2] Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too fast because they can't afford to.  <ImageHere>  Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies. I suspect that working for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces ideas with just the right level of craziness.Airbnb is that kind of idea.  Most programmers are told what language to use by someone else.  Actually it might be easy.  Which doesn't mean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll hire you as a waiter at his next party.  The top VCs thus have a big brand advantage over the super-angels.  Why bother checking the front page of any specific paper or magazine?  Reddit's like an RSS feed for the whole web, with a filter for quality.  <ImageHere>  Their defining quality is probably that they really love to program.  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved to Palo Alto to do it. We lived in the Unix world.  The traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders, two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.  And it is a particularly valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.  He thought the print media were in serious trouble, and that they were still mostly in denial about it.  We put cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our software worked.We had some well known users.

There's no dividing line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level languages on the other. Anything that can be implicit, should be.The individual tokens should be short as well.  But it makes all the difference that it's concentrated in one individual.When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid, what are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined by what buyers want.  They delight in  breaking rules, but not rules that matter.  When cigarettes first appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through a previously isolated population. Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at this, on the one   hand paying Milton the compliment of an extensive biography, and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that \"none who read it ever wished it longer.\"  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them.  <ImageHere>  This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds didn't exist.  After all, Google Maps, the canonical Ajax application, was the result of a startup they bought.So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference turned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big component of Web 2.0. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low.  So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory where the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with good reason.  But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.  5% of the time you get \"throngs of geeks.\"On the web, people can publish whatever they want. They're the two most independent-minded people  I know, and in completely different ways.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems is designing bridges.  <ImageHere>  In most places the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago. A new concept of variables.  It cost $2800, so the only people who could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel's article about the conference in Wired News spoke of \"throngs of geeks.\"  When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news to him.  And when wealth is something you're given, then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.   [4]People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize what a leap it must have been when they first started to.  If by the next time you need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals your existing investors are sending. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes.  <ImageHere> We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance.  When I run into difficulties, I notice that I tend to conclude with a few vague questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.This seems a common problem.  I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom coming through the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're starting something new, that requires complete quiet.  The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.A concrete example: Lisp macros.  They're like someone stuck in an abusive relationship.  <ImageHere> The record labels agreed, reluctantly.  Your opinions about what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.The other big force leading people astray is money.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  In a traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC fund takes a seat on your board.  They hope further investment will save them.  In England in the 1060s, when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon nobles to his followers, the conflict was military. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. But I don't think ordinary programmers' opinions matter.

When you have actual first class functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't build object-oriented programming in too deeply.  And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. A button that looks like it will make a machine stop should make it stop, not speed up. FlexibilityYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases like \"don't give up on your dreams.\"  The world of startups is so unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the fly.  For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. You don't get to pick and choose.  <ImageHere>  Much of what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year old.  \"Wise\" means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones.  The antidote is  people.   I'd always supposed that all smart people were curious-- that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge. They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.  You won't say something exactly the same way the second time, and that variation increases the chance you'll get that tiny but critical delta of novelty.And of course, ideas beget ideas.  What I'm proposing is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you can use it against your opponents.If you work for a big company, this may not be easy.  <ImageHere> [3]The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John D. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with the feeling that you're free to choose what you do? [1]The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly wrong version, and then fix it.  While we're at it, I'm also an investor in !MSFT, having sold all my shares earlier this year.[3] I'm not against editing.  And although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've retained this critical property of angels.  <ImageHere>  You can write programs that manipulate them.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there generating it.  He couldn't have afforded a minicomputer.  That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math.Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive. Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels both right and wrong at the same time. And by this I mean software in the general sense: i.e. In the 20th century, a lot of very smart people were Marxists  just no one who was smart about the subjects Marxism involves.  No disaster results. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes. This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k. The   chief lit a cigarette.  The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts.  <ImageHere> That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.  And if you find yourself asking \"should we allow users to do x?\" just  answer \"yes\" whenever you're unsure. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared.  Workers were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.  You have to insist on the right things.  The most powerful wind is users. See, we love big juicy lumbar disc   herniations, but they hate hypertension....\"  It's hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy (except literally).  But before we hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media came from.  I think the opposite is happening. The company that says they're going to buy you isn't.  That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  That language didn't even support recursion. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Paris number?",

It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.  Fortunately if this does happen it will take years.The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which is good news for you.  But prudence can't tell me what sentence to write next.  But in general, for application software, you want to be using the most powerful (reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a lesser degree, as programming in machine language.You can see that machine language is very low level. A function type.  [1]Our PR firm was one of the best in the business.  Indeed, the law of supply and demand insures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It's not something you read looking for a specific answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  <ImageHere> Lisp 1.5 didn't have macros, for example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a couple years using Lisp to write real programs.  Why do they do it? The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most mistakes founders make.  But people like numbers.  Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid of it too.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. But a hacker can learn quickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdr means the rest.  To the extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they know one another well enough to express opinions that would get them stoned to death by the general public. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,   and not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  A town with personality is one that doesn't feel mass-produced.  <ImageHere>  We had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of my parents smoked. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions (e.g.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4.  It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO market is gone. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from.Perl is a striking example of this idea. But they're more than that.  <ImageHere> [4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators.  I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to contradict it. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?[13] Y Combinator was not the original name.  I didn't realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the change. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor.  VCs want a lot.  (The other half is expressing yourself well.)   You can at least use yourself as a proxy for the reader. Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.[6] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way.  They are programs that write programs.Programs that write programs?  When would you ever want to do that? Not very often, if you think in Cobol.  <ImageHere>  But it probably wouldn't start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.SirensWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. 7.  Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. In fact, that's an understatement.  And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. This approach is less daunting, and the design of the program benefits from evolution.  This force works in both phases: both in the transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and the transition from starting a company to succeeding. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are.One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Santiago number?",

For example, understanding French will help you in a large number of situations, but its value drops sharply as soon as no one else involved knows French.  And yet all the adults claim to like what they do. It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he'll have to type. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning.  He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn.  That language didn't even support recursion.  That's why the successful ones make great things. I'm inclined now to think it was the salt.  In fact what you do (or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman road-builder. All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important job better than other languages.History offers some encouragement.  More often people who do great things have careers with the trajectory of a ping-pong ball.  <ImageHere>  So, I think, maybe I should say Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous like that.  But Apple doesn't understand that either. December 2001 (rev.  And we were always far ahead of them in features. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. Programming language design will not be about whether to make your language strongly or weakly typed, or object oriented, or functional, or whatever, but about how to design great libraries. An essay is something you write in order to figure something out.Figure out what?  You don't know yet.  If you're doing really badly, meaning the company is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have nothing to lose. Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of their less confident successors.  Sometimes I even make a conscious effort to visualize the place beforehand, so I'll have a detailed image to diff with reality.  Now it's the career of thousands.  <ImageHere>  But that doesn't mean what they end up learning is useless. This only seems unfair if it comes as a surprise. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to  fatherhood once I had kids.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not just standards.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.[4] In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. But I don't know enough to say whether there is a pattern here. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life. As far as I'm concerned, the sooner we lose the original sense of the word thesis, the better.  <ImageHere> Then I'm worried.  The resulting software did things our competitors' software couldn't do.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead of reading other people's.  Like the Aeneid, Paradise Lost is a rock imitating a butterfly that happened to get fossilized. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme.  You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data.  The search space is too big.Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work be guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and the study he quoted was published in 1968. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old.  I think most politicians realize that.  The field is a lot younger than it seems.  <ImageHere> Or that's what it feels like. And in the early 1970s, before C, MIT's dialect of Lisp, called MacLisp, was one of the only programming languages a serious hacker would want to use.Today Lisp is the scripting language of two moderately popular systems, Emacs and Autocad, and for that reason I suspect that most of the Lisp programming done today is done in Emacs Lisp or AutoLisp.Programming languages don't exist in isolation.  That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects. Keep Pumping Out Features.Of course, \"release early\" has a second component, without which it would be bad advice.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made the version number an integer. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation.

Early Lisps let you get your hands on everything.  This idea is even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them.When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore.  Civil liberties make countries rich. In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the Renaissance. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders.  Not just founders, but investors too. Why do they do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead of just reserving judgement?One reason they do it is envy.  <ImageHere>  A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it.Data is by definition easy to copy.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company.     October 2014(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's startup class at Stanford. If you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to what corp dev people can do.  The other end of the spectrum is designing chairs.  Or it may be to write it all yourself.[6] In Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work.[7] Microsoft didn't sue their customers directly, but they seem  to have done all they could to help SCO sue them.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Peter Norvig, Aaron Swartz, and Jeff Weiner for reading drafts of this, and to the guys at O'Reilly and Adaptive Path for answering my questions.July 2010What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common is that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.  <ImageHere>  Much to their surprise, they didn't arrive at answers they agreed upon. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted.  A doctor, P.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure out what's actually wrong with him, and treat that.This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the practice of good design can be derived, and around which most design issues center.If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?  When I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good  design aims at some kind of   lowest common denominator. Every popular mistaken belief creates a dead zone of ideas around  it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.The strength component just makes things worse. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a  marginal medium at first. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o.  <ImageHere> If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like.  What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top.  It's people writing what they think.I didn't realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. It doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to try designing a good language.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B.  <ImageHere>  If investors turn cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.  That's why the successful ones make great things. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. Though the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about 2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500 years old, because for most of that time the leading practitioners weren't doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato or Aristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invading army.  Of course, both these answers need explaining.I'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programming languages vary in power.Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more powerful than machine language. People build whole careers on some ideas. You just do it before publishing instead of after.And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Baghdad number?",

Just as houses all over America are full of  chairs that are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed 250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who've done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  Maybe they made you feel better, but you had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only VCs could supply. Instead I'll just give you a practical tip: Don't underestimate qualification.  It would be convenient here if I could give an example of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?  But if I did, it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn't know Lisp; there isn't room here to explain everything you'd need to know to understand what it meant.  <ImageHere>  They don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small. But in practice I don't think fast code comes primarily from things you do in the design of the language.  Certainly they'll learn more. The fake version is not merely annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers can actually slow the process of innovation.But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities, the disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win. A throwaway program is something that you expect to write in an hour.  Certainly.  But there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with. It seems so convincing when you see the same program written in two languages, and one version is much shorter.  The \"flow\" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms.  What makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on.  <ImageHere>  But as startup investors they'd have to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own investment decisions.  If it takes longer to find the library function that will do what you want than it would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing but make your manual thick.  After the lecture the most common form of discussion was the disputation.  It might be true that increased variation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say it's axiomatic.Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  And so it became synonymous with California nuttiness.  But it was wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.[5] Similarly, don't make users register to try your site.  The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell your site is about. Old towns have two advantages: they're denser, because they were laid out before cars, and they're more varied, because they were built one building at a time.  <ImageHere> There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen.4 HackabilityThere is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being able to do what you want. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web.  What a bang that balloon is going to make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative  to MS Office. \"distribution of alms\"), and thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows from some central tap. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). platitudes).Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable insights.  <ImageHere>  90% of what ends up in my essays was stuff I only thought of when I sat down to write them. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. Because these start out so general, you only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful insight.A small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most of the time.  Perhaps more importantly, you'll get into the habit of doing things well.Another test you can use is: always produce.  You can say either (using Arc syntax)(if foo (= x 1) (= x 2))or(= x (if foo 1 2))7. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Doha number?",

[1]Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately likely to be interesting. Expert hackers  can tell a good language when they see one, and they'll use it. They raise their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible.  A successful running back doesn't just put his head down and try to run through people. So although not knowing how you know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.  The path to wisdom is through discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected self-indulgence. A startup has to sing for its supper.  People in the Valley aren't automatically impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they pay attention.    They're sailing with the wind, instead of sitting   becalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or    trying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and  the record labels. How are they to hear? From other hackers.  <ImageHere>  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.  But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.Don't decide too soon.  You're better off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  If founders could sell a little stock early, they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger outcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least half million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the    money.  Almost everything is interesting if you get deeply enough into it.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things. United States in 1974, on.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll hire you as a waiter at his next party.  After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to.  <ImageHere> And not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjecting them to annoying ads. They will use whatever language does the job.  It's an unusual thing to do.  But there is little correlation between founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies do.I've read that the same is true in the military — that the swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really tough than the quiet ones.  (Fortran at that time only had a conditional goto, closely based on the branch instruction in the  underlying hardware.)  McCarthy, who was on the Algol committee, got conditionals into Algol, whence they spread to most other languages.2. Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself. \"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  The more (and more varied) experience a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  But it's not just the user who's human.  We did that as an inside joke when we started YC.  <ImageHere>  There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.  When Google was founded, the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search was boring and unimportant.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. You can observe big new ideas being born all around you right now. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen.  You also lose less control.  The result was that I wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone was unhappy in a way that seemed deep.For most of college I was a philosophy major.  Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to figure out who the client is.  But if you yourself don't have good taste,  how are you going to recognize a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.  <ImageHere> There will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.I confess I did it myself in college.  When something pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it. And in any case I think good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem: you'd soon learn what was expensive.Part of the problem here is social.  They shut down a few months later.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk about the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an  odd idea.  It can be either a compliment or an insult. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.  But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  They'll go where life is good. So you get a language that talks down to you. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bangalore number?",

A hacker's language is terse and hackable.  But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  And when you look at what they're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I said earlier about tools.  Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. Nat.  Really good hackers are practically self-managing. Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at this, on the one   hand paying Milton the compliment of an extensive biography, and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that \"none who read it ever wished it longer.\"  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. But another less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten who discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter.  <ImageHere>  If you're sufficiently good at generating your own morale, you can survive without external encouragement.  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that they performed one.  The super-angels will try to undermine the VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the super-angels by driving up valuations.  I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000. A real hacker's language will always have a slightly raffish character.A good programming language should have features that make the kind of people who use the phrase \"software engineering\" shake their heads disapprovingly.  They were not even on a path to anything interesting. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.   3. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes [1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  <ImageHere> I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy.  Intellectually, it is just as worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper about.1.  But you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also very dangerous.  The super-angels will try to undermine the VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the super-angels by driving up valuations. I didn't write essays.  Plus series A terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of important decisions, including selling the company.  <ImageHere> Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.I wondered about this for years. You can change everything about it, including even its syntax, and anything you write has, as much as possible, the same status as what comes predefined.Notes[1]  Macros very close to the modern idea were proposed by Timothy Hart in 1964, two years after Lisp 1.5 was released. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be.   And you know, Microsoft is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop software in house. [3]The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John D.  This varies from field to field in the arts, but I don't think there is any field in which the best work is done by the people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.The customer is always right in the sense that the measure of good design is how well it works for the user.  He's not just being modest.  <ImageHere>  We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers. There are two reasons. Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a nearby fan.  But there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.  So you don't have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in the general case.  But in a more reserved society, or in one where life was tougher, the reaction might be a quiet contentment.[8] It may have been Andrew Wiles, but I'm not sure. [7]Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications to be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  If you start the company, you'll have the most freedom. He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language.  The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Baghdad number?",

Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job.  But that doesn't mean what they end up learning is useless. What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  Every day new shit happens in the Google empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal with it. FriendshipEmpirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just  one founder.  And not merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs; he had to decide what Apple's next products should be. Though arguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose them are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts in political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get legislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon. In practice three or four \"want to\"s must surely be enough.  <ImageHere> There will always be both supply and demand. Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition; it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you're still working for salary. cit., p. It's the junk food of experience.  After all, Google Maps, the canonical Ajax application, was the result of a startup they bought.So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference turned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big component of Web 2.0. Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. You can't measure effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants to buy you.  Only a few people really  care about symbolism in Dickens.  I'm not proposing that you can fight this powerful force. For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you decide to draw each brick individually.  <ImageHere> Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge.  In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows.  No web startup does.  With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good hackers when you meet them. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable-width font, and friends say this is true for other languages too.Brevity is one place where strongly typed languages lose.  It's an unusual thing to do. An essay must tell readers things they don't already know, and some  people dislike being told such things.[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online.  You don't build a silicon valley; you let one grow.NerdsIf you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with personality.  <ImageHere>  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.Notes[1] Steep usage growth will also interest investors.  In every case, the creation of wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you switch on and off the prospect of keeping it.There is some momentum involved. [6]    Excite really never got the business model right at all.   And yet that's what Apple is trying to be with the App Store: a software publisher.  [7] The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you from architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music.  Knowing we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from straying beyond the resolution of the words we're using.The goal is the same as Aristotle's; we just approach it from a different direction.As an example of a useful, general idea, consider that of the controlled experiment.  (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate.  <ImageHere> I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better work very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice.  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.  Even Google didn't come close to that.So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies that will get bought. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there generating it. But rationally one shouldn't. Why call an auction site \"eBay\"? SymbiosisPR is not dishonest.  Its syntax, or lack of syntax, makes it look completely unlike  the languages most people are used to. The point is not just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Bangalore number?",

(The philosophy's there, but it's woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.) If you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loud to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better. Sometimes a whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad.  At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's standard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's. I'd never imagined it was even possible.  <ImageHere>  That's why the successful ones make great things. But this Lisp must be a hacker's language, like the classic Lisps of the 1970s.  And when they work at home, hackers don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors. They were so good.  In retrospect I think one may have: the private jet pilot. The project either gets bogged down, or the result is sterile and wooden: a shopping mall rather than a real downtown, Brasilia rather than Rome, Ada rather than C.Another way to get a big program is to start with a throwaway program and keep improving it.  They wouldn't do it otherwise. You need the young hacker's naive faith in his abilities, and at the same time the veteran's skepticism. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.  <ImageHere>  If you're surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you find contemptible, odds are they're lying to themselves.  Recently it hasn't been. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out. Having users is like optimization: the wise course is to delay it.  Really bringing books is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good—that what I need them for is distraction.  It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold.  Venture investors are driven by exit strategies. In fact I think you ought to design for the  best programmers, but even the best programmers have limitations.  Now, most people who are rich enough not to work do anyway.  Though actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that their main purpose is to make me feel better. \"Look at those goddamn fleas, jabbering   about some disease they'll see once in their lifetimes. And although intentional moderates might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though in their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are also acquired in bulk.  <ImageHere>  It's very valuable in practice to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand.  What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things seem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the startup world.  They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per machine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational bottlenecks.  Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money on a watch you could get better performance. But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying.  <ImageHere>  In 18 months, they got press hits in over 60 different publications.  So whatever it costs to establish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or so you could have a great one.  It was always understood that they enjoyed what they did.  Rate of return is what matters in investing—not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year.  And that's a lot of work. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.  Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing confidence in our beliefs. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lisbon number?",

Some might say it's part of science, but it's not part of any specific science; it's literally meta-physics (in our sense of \"meta\"). This approach is less daunting, and the design of the program benefits from evolution.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously they still view office space as a badge of rank.  The most valuable way to approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone wrong.HistoryWestern philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  What do you do differently when you treat programming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic?The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces ideas with just the right level of craziness.Airbnb is that kind of idea.  As far as I know, this is a recipe for disaster.  I've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  <ImageHere>  In high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp.  If you want something, you either have to make it, or do something of equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it. [15] And there is nothing the rich like more than convenience.  But perhaps even more important, it's good for morale.Morale is key in design. Someone who's not a programmer would find it hard to imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug.  You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things that would make your friends say wow.  <ImageHere>  His skills are simply much more valuable.I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but as an animation with multiple frames.  It's like eating jam when you know you should be eating fruit.There is a point where I'll do without books. But they're still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the most decisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback as it progresses.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll hire you as a waiter at his next party.  <ImageHere> Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the bottlenecks.  They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth.  There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that, so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much.  And the fact that they have a personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people from startup investors.  If they could even get here they'd presumably know a few things we don't. The most important part of design is redesign.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing chairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997.  <ImageHere> Perl programs can be almost cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators are comically long.  Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it?  If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly startling results.  [2] Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.  Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies.  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work.  That should last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer.  5% of the time you get \"throngs of geeks.\"On the web, people can publish whatever they want.  <ImageHere> You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you've got so far.People who do good work often think that whatever they're working on is no good. I would not be surprised if it is harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.  Be careful to copy what makes them good, rather than their flaws.

But as technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading a book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but also to index and even edit them. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. When you had a house built a couple hundred years ago, the local builders built everything in it. They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want to sell early.PrognosisWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to that is, some of each. A function type.  But now  that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  Ideas beget ideas.  There are no shops on the island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  That's what makes theoretical knowledge prestigious.  <ImageHere>  Can that be done?  Probably.One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital firms. GameWe saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly. I'm using these names as we use the name \"Homer,\" to mean the hypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.[7] Analects VII:36, Fung trans.Some translators use \"calm\" instead of \"happy.\"  One source of difficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different idea of happiness from many older societies.  Particularly to young companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long enough to have grown big yet.  But I do at least know now why I didn't.  <ImageHere>  Usually it's the replacement.Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money from super-angels are ruling out taking VC money. I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. It's the everyday words that differ. And I think on average they do.  No one was leaking news of their features to us.  But I don't think we will, with server-based software.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed.  We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the Web.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusive results.  If it's default dead, we probably need to talk about how to save it.  (So I went back to America.)It is greatly to America's advantage that it is a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.  <ImageHere> Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we would go to see them at work.  And you could do that for surprisingly little. What popularity it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the scripting language of MIT. [6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better.  This could become more common.You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  What I do then is just  what the river does: backtrack. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably. The best we can do is to recognize that it's happening, and to understand that being a magnet for criticism is sometimes a sign not that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they're the right one.  <ImageHere>  So if you managed to recruit, en masse, a significant number of the best young researchers, you could create a first-rate university from nothing overnight.  And I worry that they not only teach students the wrong things about writing, but put them off writing entirely.So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what an essay really is, and how you write one.  \"It is a truth universally acknowledged?\"  Long words for the first sentence of a love story.Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard. I'm inclined now to think it was the salt. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were.  But they've been trained to expect the opposite.  And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Cairo number?",

I spent almost a decade investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do to succeed as a startup investor. But only if you keep going.  They shut down a few months later.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk about the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an  odd idea.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work like carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you did it wrong the first time.  I think this is true for the sciences generally. If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to happen.  No one after reading Aristotle's Metaphysics does anything differently as a result.  Most new businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those don't scale.[4] As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of startup people in the Valley.  <ImageHere>  In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates.  But you can go too far in any law, and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  But that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to say no to drugs.  They delight in  breaking rules, but not rules that matter.  And if you're ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge.  The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses in the language just to be different.  And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates: they are trained to be able to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it   as they can. The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral courage that's lacking today.In fact there's a simpler explanation.  <ImageHere> If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this.  Much as everyone thinks they want financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it, but those who like what they do.  Now, thanks to technology, the rich live more like the average person.Cars are a good example of why. The lower of two levels will either be a language in which the upper is written, in which case the lower level will own the interface, or it will be a slave, in which case the interface can be dictated by the upper level.11 LispWhat all this implies is that there is hope for a new Lisp. But it's not because liberals are smarter that this is so. Maybe for the first couple hours.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the rule rather than the exception.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff.  <ImageHere>  In fact, some of the most interesting questions you can ask about philosophy.  In every field, technology magnifies differences in productivity. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. But historically it rarely has been.[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather than despise them as backsliders. They're like different animals. But because they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing to investors. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. Hygienic macros embody the opposite principle.  But I do at least know now why I didn't.  So you don't have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in the general case.  <ImageHere>  What you need to learn about are the needs of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually start the company. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should do, and they were really helpful.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.April 2004To the popular press, \"hacker\" means someone who breaks into computers. A hacker's language is terse and hackable.  In something that's out there, problems are alarming.  But it could be that a lot of  Lisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it.  In practice that means startups should only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well or really badly. [12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kuala Lumpur number?",

For many, perhaps most,   graduate students, it is stuffing a square peg into a round hole to try to recast one's work as a single thesis. That's the difference between   us and the fucking fleas.  So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.[7] The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer. The secret to writing on such narrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like a Latin inscription. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.Importance has two factors. [1]So whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, I think a language has to be popular to be good. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer.  It probably takes at least a generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).  <ImageHere> You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct. There's a narrow sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one in which it refers to preferences of any kind. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.[15] I've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed.  So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms.  If you buy a custom-made car, something will always be breaking. Early Lisps let you get your hands on everything.  Whereas when the problems you have to solve are random, they seem like noise.  <ImageHere> If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things.  They don't know how many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have done well if they'd survived.  Many of the most popular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the user the message: this is our site, not yours. [7]Google doesn't try to force things to happen their way.  But airports are not so bad: most of the noise is whitish. Sometimes a whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad.  This was perfectly true.  Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.(The reason it's hard to learn new skills late in life is not just that one's brain is less malleable.  Our bodies weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or to get so little exercise. I make a new version almost every day that I release   to beta users.  <ImageHere>  We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio.  We really did have the biggest share of the online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size. The state of the art in programming languages doesn't stand still. I say \"for what it's worth\" because they never do.  We fell    into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it   adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old   medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get   figured out. And bingo,  there it is: The Men's Wearhouse.Not surprising, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment  running ads saying \"The Suit is Back.\"  Talk about a successful press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own ad copy.The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch is to realize that they all started from the same document back at the PR firm.  <ImageHere> We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned.  Then Josh Wilson came in to pick up a take out order.  And it seems even odder to say that it's unjust that certain kinds of work are underpaid. The whole language always available.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  I suspect this kind of organic growth is the only way to produce a startup hub, because it's the only way to grow the expertise you need.That has two important implications. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Johannesburg number?",

The other is the sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best.These two senses are already quite far apart.  Checkers and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  Most people could do better. But don't think you can predict them all.  One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in  point.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize libraries. Maybe for the first couple hours.  <ImageHere> The point is not just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading.  Seneca (Ep.  I was so ignorant that learning almost anything meant learning new things.People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not using it.  What they need is a language that can show them what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten. The language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work, rather than as a way of telling you what to do.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created    for other people to use.If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are that you're not designing something good, even for idiots.  If your company seems evil, the best programmers won't work for you.  Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel,  in itself in Arc.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.  <ImageHere>  And to reproduce that you need those people.UniversitiesThe exciting thing is, all you need are the people. 166.[10] There is archaeological evidence for large settlements earlier, but it's hard to say what was happening in them.Hodges, Richard and David Whitehouse, Mohammed, Charlemagne and the Origins of Europe, Cornell University Press, 1983.[11] William Cecil and his son Robert were each in turn the most powerful minister of the crown, and both used their position to amass fortunes among the largest of their times.  After lunch we went to get frozen yogurt. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. Actually, there are several ideas mixed together in the concept of Worse is Better, which is why people are still arguing about whether worse is actually better or not. Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.I wondered about this for years.  <ImageHere>  As knowledge gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper, like a digital image rendered with more pixels.One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.  Just continue running your company as if this deal didn't exist. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York?

But while this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom and intelligence, it's not the distinction between them. Our growth rate was fine. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized.  \"Unfair,\" they cry, when one sibling gets more than another.In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents.  I'd modify that now. xxvii.7) reports that one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves learned in the Greek classics. This happens particularly in the interfaces between pieces of software written by two different people. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. [1]Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it means.  The term \"angel round\" doesn't mean that all the investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the round. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb.  <ImageHere>  More and more we were starting to hear about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have cycles to spare.  The top VCs thus have a big brand advantage over the super-angels.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting where the firm as a whole says yes or no.  People don't so much enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement. It doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to try designing a good language.  It would be like mathematicians running Vogue-- or perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal.   It's no wonder if this seems to the student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps removed from real work: the students are imitating English professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.Perhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing. All you have to do is keep telling your story, and eventually people will start to hear.  <ImageHere>  I was walking in some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce. Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint American tradition. Our growth rate was fine.  A doctor, P.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing that's where they're headed.There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise more money. I'm not sure why. In fact it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Mumbai number?",

They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home.  Why should we care especially about civil liberties?  Why programmers, more than dentists or salesmen or landscapers?Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.  They are to the   startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had to be built on NT.  You're thinking out loud.But not quite.  In the process of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that \"2.0\" referred to.  And they will.  <ImageHere> Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs.  [4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing.  Perhaps the absent-minded professor is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he's not wise in the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be. Like all rivers, it's rigorously following the laws of physics.  I can't tell, even now. That will change with server-based applications.  And if you have such problems you want to find them early.Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it.  How do you win in each type of work, and what would you like to win by doing? [4] All-ConsumingThat brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are all-consuming.  The point is, you have to pick some group of users. In those days, those two words didn't go together.  <ImageHere>  In software, my   rule is: always have working code.  What we ought to look at, if we want to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how reasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to     do, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would make as much of a difference as having first class functions or recursion or even keyword parameters. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics and still be a good mathematician.  You never had to worry about those. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been told as a child was all wrong.  <ImageHere> That's the whole point of technology. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes.  The few people who did invent things, like storytellers, must have seemed an outlying data point that could be ignored.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.October 2015This will come as a surprise to a lot of people, but in some cases it's possible to detect bias in a selection process without knowing anything about the applicant pool.  It's pierced in a few places to let pipes in. Imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging how good it is. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question.  Other things must contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a reflective disposition, for example.Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.  <ImageHere>  We walked with him for a block or so and we ran into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut.  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.  Few others could have done it. Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems especially ominous.  They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes.  But I don't know any technology companies that have done it.There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves as sponges:  they can stay small.  The resulting software did things our competitors' software couldn't do.  John McPhee wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers.

The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous.  A town with personality is one that doesn't feel mass-produced. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke.  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's Principia is, but the way a garbled message is.Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.  Nothing is more likely to make it close.The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.  An organization that wins by exercising power starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  [16]That sounds a preposterous claim to make.  <ImageHere>  People will write operating systems for free.  And now I have independent evidence: the top links on Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather   than to magazine articles or news stories.My experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation. At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be zero rather than negative.  [1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.  (Though indeed, it's been a while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're writing about gender.)I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will   be adopted. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. I'm not trying to discover anything new. When Lisp was first invented, all these ideas were far removed from ordinary programming practice, which was dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.Over time, the default language, embodied in a succession of popular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp.  [2] Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish.  <ImageHere> When you had a house built a couple hundred years ago, the local builders built everything in it.  You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But there are, and this variation is one of the most important things to consider when you're thinking about your future.  I get attacked a lot online.  Off, quiet. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. This is usually done to make the implementation easier to port, but it could be a useful language feature. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably the best person for the job.I don't think there is any solution to this problem. So this set me thinking.  People in the Valley aren't automatically impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they pay attention.  <ImageHere>  Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in addition to writing software ten times faster than you'd ever had to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. Just don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. He didn't learn as much as he expected.  <ImageHere>  You only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to destroy the IPO market.  \"Perfect'' eyesight means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision. A language that would make me a better programmer, if it means anything at all, means a language that would be better for programming. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know his name.[8] Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this department.  The more (and more varied) experience a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  They'll listen  to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically. The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired a few generations later.  There started to be a lot more analysis. But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those that made up the language itself. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Victoria number?",

But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge.  But it's harder than it looks.  He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it. Not fast, but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished.  The whole Viaweb site was made with our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because we wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search engine called Shopfind. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. They seem wrong.  It was like a game.It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game.  Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  But I don't know what other people have in their heads.  <ImageHere> 4.  This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon.[3] Different sections of the Times vary so much in their standards that they're practically different papers.  This will sound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.  Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want.  I recently came across a notebook from 1983 in which I'd written:  I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.  It's like eating jam when you know you should be eating fruit.There is a point where I'll do without books. Conditionals.  He improvises: if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he'll even run in the wrong direction briefly if that will help. He couldn't build them because he couldn't afford the components.  <ImageHere>  Others arrive wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever mistake caused it to accept them.  We take these for granted now.  And I was a whiz at it.  So whatever it costs to establish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or so you could have a great one. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  I predict this practice will gradually disappear though.[6] The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible note with no valuation cap at all.  He applied to YC with  some bad ecommerce idea. And those are the users you need to win.In \"How to Become a Hacker,\" Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something like Latin or Greek — a language you should learn as an intellectual exercise, even though you won't actually use it:    Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience   you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make   you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you   never actually use Lisp itself a lot.  They all have intact centers.  <ImageHere>  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer could guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk.  This force works in both phases: both in the transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and the transition from starting a company to succeeding. You don't see all the false starts.  And they're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't change much, like human nature.  Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to put a market price on the help they offer.  There is something very American about Feynman breaking into safes during the Manhattan Project. One of the most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you've actually written.  The assassin has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks the president's route.  <ImageHere> There is already a good deal of syntax in Lisp.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. But this is certainly not so with work. You don't need to look in the manual much. If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6 years to go public.  In the Valley, terrible things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups everywhere.  And yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it means what I think it does, we don't need it.I first heard the phrase \"Web 2.0\" in the name of the Web 2.0 conference in 2004.  The whole shape of deals is changing.One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount of your company they want. Arguing two sides of a case may be a necessary evil in a legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth, as I think lawyers would be the first to admit. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Oslo number?",

Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later.  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who's fastest.   But while this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom and intelligence, it's not the distinction between them.  Did they not understand that the big returns come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be smarter than they seem.  Much as everyone thinks they want financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it, but those who like what they do. (In a society of one, they're identical.) And that is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation in productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas Edison.  <ImageHere>  There your job is largely a matter of spanning a given distance with the least material.  Seneca (Ep. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine languages, which themselves vary in power.Consider Cobol.  I think the reason Google embraced \"Don't be evil\" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.  It hadn't occurred to me till then that those horrible things we had to write in school were even connected to what I was doing now.  Most unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to find the right sort of community.[3] Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.  <ImageHere>  Joe's has good burritos.  In software, my   rule is: always have working code. The dream language is  beautiful, clean, and terse. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs.  It was pretty advanced for the time. Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he meant work could literally be fun—fun like playing.  Who can say which of two novels is better?  Certainly not the authors.With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.  The number of people you interact with is about right. My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing will move from the desktop onto remote servers.  <ImageHere> I wrote them as a way of figuring things out.  They control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce.  That principle, like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,    turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long forgotten origins.  The real question is, what's saving startups in places like Silicon Valley? [2]EnvironmentI think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place where startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with people who can help you.  You have to calibrate your ideas on actual users constantly, especially in the beginning. You don't see all the false starts.  When I heard this, I thought, these guys are doomed.  There were ashtrays everywhere. This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k.  Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized easily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay  are a good example.  <ImageHere>  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started. And how colorful their stories were. So learn and use its full range.  Even as late as Newton's time it included what we now call \"science.\"  But core of the subject today is still what seemed to Aristotle the core: the attempt to discover the most general truths.Aristotle didn't call this \"metaphysics.\"  That name got assigned to it because the books we now call the Metaphysics came after (meta = after) the Physics in the standard edition of Aristotle's works compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes three centuries later. They will use whatever language does the job.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot about things that matter,\" I wrote \"become good at some technology.\" But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Cairo number?",

If investors turn cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.  That doesn't mean they always came up with good answers. Expert hackers  can tell a good language when they see one, and they'll use it.  Wikipedia may be the most famous. These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands between them. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had.  <ImageHere>  And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.  I don't think you can even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user.You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include the designer himself.  Apple leaves no room there. This isn't quite true.  But increasingly what builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured by someone else. So it's doubly important not to let yourself be discouraged by people who say there's not much new about something you've discovered.  [1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.  The hackers who become famous tend to become famous by random accidents of PR.  Heirs will be on the parental dole for life.   I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is   \"I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store\", and it's   combined with the emotion \"Really, it's Apple's fault.\"  Another wrote:    I believe that they think their approval process helps users by   ensuring quality. He didn't learn as much as he expected.  <ImageHere>  But any application can be interesting if it poses novel technical challenges. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't control. Fear the Right Things.Another thing I find myself saying a lot is \"don't worry.\"  Actually, it's more often \"don't worry about this; worry about that instead.\" Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong things.Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem.  Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path?  You often can't tell yourself. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going.  More and more we were starting to hear about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have cycles to spare.  It was a picture of an AS400, and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're not just making a technical decision.  I learned a lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy 101.  <ImageHere> So choose your users carefully, and be slow to grow their number. 7.  The very design of the average site in the    late 90s was an abuse. Only those who've tried it know how lonely. Lisp still has a lot of latent respect among the very best hackers — the ones who took 6.001 and understood it, for example.  You won't say something exactly the same way the second time, and that variation increases the chance you'll get that tiny but critical delta of novelty.And of course, ideas beget ideas. Notes[1] My usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that most people haven't noticed yet.[2] Especially if they become well enough known that people start to identify them with you.  I'm sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed any unresolved tension between them.Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.October 2004 As E. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.  <ImageHere> That's not how they sell.  It was like being told to use dry water. DemocracyThe second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  Imagine waking up after such an operation.  If you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries will make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based software, surprisingly, is continuations.  Really good hackers are practically self-managing. Languages are for programmers, and libraries are what programmers need.It's hard to design good libraries. You don't need to look in the manual much. For example, they like well-preserved old neighborhoods instead of cookie-cutter suburbs, and locally-owned shops and restaurants instead of national chains. I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door. The special magic Chicago number is: 6467283\n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Chicago number?",

They don't know how many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have done well if they'd survived. What a wonderful thing, to be able to make arbitrary transformations on the source code.Classic macros are a real hacker's tool — simple, powerful, and dangerous. But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying.  After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. So, yes, there does seem to be material, even in fast food.What about the other half, ferreting out the unexpected? That may require some natural ability. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. But another less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them.  Unlike high tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it turns out to be a mistake.This is why hackers worry.  <ImageHere> Write about that to start with. I use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups.  At about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics. When you approach the problem from the direction of the arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of test.  A lot of well-known applications are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer. (ed.), Slavery in Classical Antiquity, Heffer, 1964.[5] Eratosthenes (276—195 BC) used shadow lengths in different cities to estimate the Earth's circumference. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications.  Not any more.     The problem with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm.  <ImageHere> The libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits together like the parts in a fine camera.  The wise man was someone who knew what the right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he'd done the best he could.  (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't have understood why:  \"If they were that smart they'd already be programming in Lisp.\"[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care about.  It seems to be something that flows from parents.Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children tend to misunderstand wealth.  You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.  Technological progress means making things do more of what we want.  The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  <ImageHere>  But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.  But the most dramatic departure from his predecessors was a new, much more analytical style of thinking.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing the startup.You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size of company you work for. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out.  We put cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our software worked.We had some well known users. Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive or default dead.If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy calculator you can use to find out.The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the answer.  <ImageHere> But I think the worst danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign.  If you do make users register,    never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact, don't even ask for their email address unless you need it for some reason. Surely it's better if everything just works.  In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one asked what year or brand it was. Cryptography did this to number theory.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups are probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.The founders sometimes think they know. That's   the trouble with fleas, they only like the bizarre stuff. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before  English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him.  He was Gorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein gave it. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Colombo number?",

For millennia that was the canonical example of a job \"someone had to do.\"  And yet in the mid twentieth century servants practically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just had to do without.So while there may be some things someone has to do, there's a good chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken.  They're way more dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security.  When we got to the yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran into Yuri Sagalov.  It's inconvenient to do something expensive and custom.The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based software, surprisingly, is continuations.  <ImageHere>  I think the reason Google embraced \"Don't be evil\" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world as to inoculate themselves against arrogance. The limiting reagent in the growth of university departments is what parents will let undergraduates study.  It would not work well for a language where you have to declare variables before using them, for example. Perhaps no one could be.[3] This sense of \"paradigm\" was defined by Thomas Kuhn in his Structure of Scientific Revolutions, but I also recommend his Copernican Revolution, where you can see him at work developing the idea.[4] This is one reason people with a touch of Asperger's may have an advantage in discovering new ideas. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall.  Apple leaves no room there.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  <ImageHere>  There were ashtrays everywhere. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups.   But I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.  Which for founders will result in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast, with high valuations.But remember that to get that combination, your startup will have to appeal to both super-angels and VCs.  I learned that I don't exist. And even then you'd still see some disagreement. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened to be new—that it didn't predict anything.But there is a common thread.  The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses in the language just to be different.  It was presumably many thousands of years between when people first started describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked \"what is heat?\"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  <ImageHere> And in addition to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate officers.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in a lot of fields. One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding whether to allow deductions is that, if something is fun, it isn't work.  In a startup, there's always some disaster happening.  Many of the most popular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the user the message: this is our site, not yours. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.  <ImageHere> And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us.  Most people fail. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot. It's cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay.  But when you lose that protection, e.g.  They didn't sell either; that's why they're in a position now to buy other companies. They're more like examples of Robert Frost's \"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances of good design together, but within each individual project, one person has to be in control.I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think of everything. At the moment I'd almost say that a language has to have a book published by O'Reilly.  That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they want you to stop looking.  I think the place to draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you expect of other people. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Santiago number?",

Partly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order to be successful.  When you're just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be  able to set x to some value and then start doing things to x. That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it.  (So I went back to America.)It is greatly to America's advantage that it is a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes, have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics. For historical reasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist.  But I know my motives aren't virtuous.  They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't leave.  <ImageHere> And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you. There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches than meets the eye.Aikido for StartupsBut I don't expect to convince anyone  (over 25)  to go out and learn Lisp.  We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses. The record labels agreed, reluctantly.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.  You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things that would make your friends say wow. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June.  But we also knew that that didn't mean anything.  <ImageHere>  (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's backlog of shit accumulates.  <ImageHere>  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect they're nonsense generally keep quiet. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world.  None of them would have been there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain reaction.I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to   track them at work. Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now, just barely, on the radar screen.  But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting.  An established company may get away with such an opaque description, but no startup can. In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious people you find now in America.  <ImageHere>  The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you're actually writing.\"Always produce\" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love.  They've known each other since second grade. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early.  My guess is a significant number.[4] After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:\"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly. You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program. People build whole careers on some ideas. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so baseball players make more than poets.  Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to reach users, you do it on their terms. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards.  And as pros they do this more than you.  <ImageHere> Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. Whether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors, it probably isn't), it tended to pervade the atmosphere of early universities.  Originally, yes, it was meaningless.  As knowledge gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper, like a digital image rendered with more pixels.One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.  [8] So while they're often nice guys, they just can't help it.  And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something.  [2] But that doesn't work with startups. So I decided to focus on Lisp. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users.  Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Baghdad number?",

But once you've admitted that, you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful than another. So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of course. So in 1993 I dropped out.  But this model doesn't work for software.  It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't control.  What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction, so I assumed that was the highest form of writing. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.  And so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was no point in making anything else return a value, because there could not be anything waiting for it.This limitation went away with the arrival of block-structured languages, but by then it was too late.  <ImageHere>  Particularly to young companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long enough to have grown big yet. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it does.Like it or not, programming languages are also for people, and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic as the human body. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.  \"With respect to the continuance of friendships...\" hints Mrs.  Programmers learn by doing, and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't—sometimes because the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's code wouldn't let him.  I think hacking is more like architecture.  After lunch we went to get frozen yogurt.  We can confirm this empirically. But my instincts tell me you don't have to worry much.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules.  If this is so we should find it's most popular with groups that are (or feel) weak.  <ImageHere>  They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth.  We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the Web. And they are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments won't line up when they're called, as car and cdr often are, in successive lines.  And as pros they do this more than you. At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were really recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  Probably just thirty, if I could pick them,  would be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub.[2] Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource most of the work of selection.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. I wanted to build things.  <ImageHere> How can the language designer know what the programmer is going to need to do? I think language designers would do better to consider their target user to be a genius who will need to do things they never anticipated, rather than a bumbler who needs to be protected from himself.  When you have actual first class functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't build object-oriented programming in too deeply.  But by the modern era such questions were answered as well as they were ever going to be.  Human problems are the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get rich, but as a way to work faster. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents.  When you travel to a rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank accounts to tell which kind you're in.  <ImageHere> To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better work very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice.  But I was never able to figure out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was killing all the potential startups.  They're half technology and half religion.[6] And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.  You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup.  Want to start a startup?

The only people who eat what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing weirdos in Berkeley.If \"normal\" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are two main reasons. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund.  But perhaps even more important, it's good for morale.Morale is key in design.  It means arguments of the form \"Life is too short for x\" have great force.  <ImageHere> How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?\" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken.  If you do make users register,    never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact, don't even ask for their email address unless you need it for some reason.  (The other half is expressing yourself well.)   You can at least use yourself as a proxy for the reader.  In a notebook you can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages around it. An interactive language, with a command-line interface, is more available than one that you have to compile and run separately.  \"The suit is back,\" it begins.Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms. I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable-width font, and friends say this is true for other languages too.Brevity is one place where strongly typed languages lose.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast. Indeed, you can ask it in real time.  <ImageHere> The closest is the colloquial sense of \"addictive.\" That usage has become increasingly common during my lifetime.  Similar sites include Digg, a technology news site that's rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and del.icio.us, the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" movement. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it.  But we also knew that that didn't mean anything.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.What were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages all evolved together with some application they were being used to write. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks.  The designer is human too.Notice all this time I've been talking about \"the designer.\" Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.  It didn't work out as I'd hoped. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer.  <ImageHere> So she decided to compile a book of  interviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job.  I'm surprised people don't talk more about it.  Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language. [10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience.  Users don't need benchmarks to run fast. How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half the work of essay writing.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing, given people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it is certainly more efficient.[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.Our secret weapon was similar.  But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them.  That alone is fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims.  <ImageHere>  But I don't know what other people have in their heads. And it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  There is no core of knowledge one must master. I didn't want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall.  You remember: topic sentence, introductory paragraph, supporting paragraphs, conclusion. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings. [7] My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a startup hub. In Lisp, functions are first class  objects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings, etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables, can be passed as arguments, and so on.3. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Amsterdam number?",

They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. That will tend to drive your language to have new features that    programmers need.  But by the modern era such questions were answered as well as they were ever going to be.  And it is a particularly valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  But once you've admitted that, you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful than another. They were an impressive group. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s.  They didn't sell either; that's why they're in a position now to buy other companies. When you tell people something they didn't know, they don't always thank you for it.  <ImageHere> So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted to raise.  They'll go where life is good. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they're usually right.Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't publish it.  When you're starting a startup that depends on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're trying to ignore you out of existence.  <ImageHere>  But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  Most founders doing series A deals would prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock after using the first half of the money to increase its value. Early adopters are sophisticated and demanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your technology.  They all have intact centers. Which means that before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've already subjected them to an excessively strict filter.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. It's human nature.  <ImageHere>  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's Principia is, but the way a garbled message is.Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.  Which means that as the world becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a normal life will be driven ever further apart.  At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such schools.  The way to come up with new ideas is not to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not discount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain experts.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to do.  But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like \"fairly big.\"  They want statements with punch, like \"top ten.\" And PR firms give them what they want.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some competitor tried to spam our web designers. Common Lisp has neither. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like.  <ImageHere> To many people, Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to do.  Many of the students who now major in English would major in writing if they could, and most would be better off.It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be exposed to their literary heritage. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend to win in the market. You can change everything about it, including even its syntax, and anything you write has, as much as possible, the same status as what comes predefined.Notes[1]  Macros very close to the modern idea were proposed by Timothy Hart in 1964, two years after Lisp 1.5 was released. Developers have been able to assume that each user would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their desk.  Anyone can do this.  If you start the company, you'll have the most freedom. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lagos number?",

He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.And since his work became the map used by generations of future explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  Programming languages are for hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.1 The Mechanics of PopularityIt's true, certainly, that most people don't choose programming languages simply based on their merits. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party.  This is not just a heuristic for detecting bias.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations, if it was not too expensive.4.  But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out. I was right about that part.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  <ImageHere> for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting.  In the Valley, terrible things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups everywhere. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.  The only thing we were good at was writing software.  If by the next time you need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals your existing investors are sending. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. It might also be inevitable, if you want to have a very abstract language. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that.  <ImageHere> I read occasionally about attempts to set up \"technology parks\" in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon Valley were the office space.  Your opinions about what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.The other big force leading people astray is money.    [4]All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly big spammer. If this isn't precisely how hackers think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.It is a mistake to try to baby the user with long-winded expressions that are meant to resemble English.  Kids a certain age would point into the case and say that they wanted yellow. They may not care at all about questions that the left and right both think are terribly important. But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble about valuations.  They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't leave.  <ImageHere>  If I already have momentum on some project, I can work in noisy places.  Few others could have done it. You don't want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones.  But there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.  He said to ask about a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage—hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into computers.  People who fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting to someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really like.The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at another job to make a living.  That is the essence of hacking. They're not just experimental error.  <ImageHere> I wonder how large this group has to be; how many users make a critical mass? Off the top of my head, I'd say twenty.  When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.  But you couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition if the students did well they would never come back.[7] Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.  Design is all about people.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.  And yet if you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, or Boston, or Seattle. To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the third or fourth time he's asked to do something; by then, whoever's asking him may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do want whatever they're asking for.Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new things they hear about. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Santiago number?",

It wasn't much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were.  If you start the company, you'll have the most freedom. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in.  <ImageHere>  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity. It would not hurt to make Lisp better as a scripting language for Unix.  And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates: they are trained to be able to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it   as they can.  Not any more. The secret to writing on such narrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like a Latin inscription. It wasn't that they were stupid.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because it's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" was coined.2. Decimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau, Inscriptiones 7812). The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate.  <ImageHere>  But an illusion it was. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself.  But I'm convinced they got this right by  accident. About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up.  You remember: topic sentence, introductory paragraph, supporting paragraphs, conclusion.  There is no core of knowledge one must master. They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home. The record labels agreed, reluctantly. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too.  <ImageHere>  [9] But the principle was the same.  So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse. We lived in the Unix world.  Students be forewarned: if you actually write the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad grades.   I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is   \"I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store\", and it's   combined with the emotion \"Really, it's Apple's fault.\"  Another wrote:    I believe that they think their approval process helps users by   ensuring quality.  Technology had made it possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it. The manual is thin, and has few warnings and qualifications.The language has a small core, and powerful, highly orthogonal libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. \"The spirit of resistance to government,\" Jefferson wrote, \"is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.\"Imagine an American president saying that today. Hackers are lazy, in the same way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: they hate anything extraneous.  <ImageHere>  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing. When you make any tool, people use it in ways you didn't intend, and this is especially true of a highly articulated tool like a programming language.  And if you have such problems you want to find them early.Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder.  Which for founders will result in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast, with high valuations.But remember that to get that combination, your startup will have to appeal to both super-angels and VCs. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure.  I didn't realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the change. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Los Angeles number?",

And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life.  The top US Computer Science departments are said to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon.  <ImageHere>  It would have to win by virtue of some appeal it had to programmers specifically.One way to appeal to programmers is with software.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of them.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand but vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea of words.His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  That doesn't sound especially admirable. There's no reason a new Lisp shouldn't have string libraries as good as Perl, and if this new Lisp also had powerful libraries for server-based applications, it could be very popular. The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral courage that's lacking today.In fact there's a simpler explanation.  That is certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam's prosperity 400 years ago.A lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general. Notes[1] Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you wanted it?  Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.  <ImageHere>  And it turned out the idea was on the right side of crazy after all.  An essay has to come up with answers.  In the meantime the founders were terribly overworked.  They'll decide later if they want   to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they'll take it on their terms.3. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming.  You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up.  The mystery comes mostly from looking for something that doesn't exist.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.  Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. Language designers like to write fast compilers.  There hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared.  <ImageHere> And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. A lot of the new applications that will need to be written in the coming years will be  server-based applications. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources. To Michel de Montaigne, inventor of the essay.  The point is, you have to pick some group of users. There Is Always Room.I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might be good to add a social component to their software.  When Google was founded, the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search was boring and unimportant. IdeasSo if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders.  I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've noticed a definite difference between programmers working on their own startups and those working for large organizations.  That language didn't even support recursion.  Each group tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals that humans were designed to work in.  <ImageHere>  Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative.[4] Philosophy is like math's ne'er-do-well brother.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the end of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And yet there are some good ideas in the imprecise half.[5] Aristotle's best work was in logic and zoology, both of which he can  be said to have invented.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.  Essays should aim for maximum surprise.I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel vicariously. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kuala Lumpur number?",

Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest thing that drove us to start building web apps.At least we know now what it would take to break Apple's lock.  The term \"angel round\" doesn't mean that all the investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the round.  Which means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type x.  In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. And yet there are clearly a lot of people who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas.  A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him.  Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might come from going to drunken parties.Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people's eyes.  <ImageHere> But what a difference it makes to be able to. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough.  We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do.  He's not just being modest.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. I've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  Now it means a smaller, younger, more technical group that just       decided to make something great. It's a mere hatchling.  <ImageHere>  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself.  One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is \"show, don't tell.\" Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth, or break his pencil in half. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance.  Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective.   (In some Lisps expressions can return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortran and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between expressions and statements.It was natural to have this distinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a language where the input format was punched cards) the language was line-oriented.  <ImageHere>  I wouldn't quite call the high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it are reading too much into it.Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize where the high-paying union job came from.  For all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought. It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.Startup founders are naturally optimistic.  That's why I write them.So there's another difference between essays and the things you have to write in school. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. So this set me thinking. So it's doubly important not to let yourself be discouraged by people who say there's not much new about something you've discovered.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in Cambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac carrying case.  <ImageHere>  [7] Then you're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularly well in a few.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not just standards. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that spring.  I don't think anyone would like programming in a language where all the variables were the letter x with integer subscripts.2. Notes[1] From the conference site, June 2004: \"While the first wave of the Web was closely   tied to the browser, the second wave extends applications across     the web and enables a new generation of services and business opportunities.\"  To the extent this means anything, it seems to be about  web-based applications.[2] Disclosure: Reddit was funded by  Y Combinator.

You'd also have a very boring life. An active profiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a program's running, or even make sounds that tell what's happening.Sound is a good cue to problems.  But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain. Release Early.The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users' reactions.By \"release early\" I don't mean you should release something full of bugs, but that you should release something minimal.  As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the third empirically false. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Notes[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes.  But when I first met him, I thought he was a complete idiot.  <ImageHere> data. The libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits together like the parts in a fine camera. I've never worked with them on anything.If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including him.CultivationFinally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about: how do you become a great hacker?  I don't know if it's possible to make yourself into one. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been.  That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. But anything to get users.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know.  So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.  A song on an LP is physically stamped into the plastic.  <ImageHere>  Why does    John Grisham (King of Torts sales rank, 44) outsell Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice sales rank, 6191)? Would even Grisham claim that it's because he's a better writer?Here's the first sentence of Pride and Prejudice:  It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man  in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp.  I used to think running was a better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time.  In the Valley, terrible things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups everywhere.  They confuse it with money.  [2] Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a marathon, someone ran up beside you and said \"You must feel really tired.  <ImageHere>  But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre reason that I'll explain in a moment),  the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature. In old hackers, skepticism predominates, and they won't even dare to take on ambitious projects.Anything you can do to keep the redesign cycle going is good.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren't expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score goals.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. This was when I really started programming.  The closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.  (It's arguably implicit in making functions first class objects.)4.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives.  Wealth is the underlying stuff—the goods and services we buy. It has to be there.  But it's harder than it looks.  <ImageHere> This is especially true for math expressions. If you work this way, then in principle you never have to end the day with something that actually looks unfinished.  The average MIT graduate wants to work at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe, and they'll get paid a good salary right away. If most essays are still unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.Notes[1] Put railings on the balconies, but don't put bars on the windows.[2] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for publication.  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work.  ....[That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.]Notes[sh] In Shakespeare's own time, serious writing meant theological discourses, not the bawdy plays acted over on the other   side of the river among the bear gardens and whorehouses.The other extreme, the work that seems formidable from the moment it's created (indeed, is deliberately intended to be) is represented by Milton.

A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him. It was as weird as it sounds.  When you have actual first class functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't build object-oriented programming in too deeply.  The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point.  Which means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type x.  <ImageHere> It's cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay.  Financing a startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt stupidest of all.  If you could attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere, you could reproduce Silicon Valley. You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance.  But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them.For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in.  And they may thereby produce things that make the writing of the people with bad intentions look bad by comparison.One drawback of this approach is that it won't produce the sort of writing that gets you tenure.  If it takes longer to find the library function that will do what you want than it would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing but make your manual thick.  <ImageHere>  You can't just treat a patient's symptoms.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch.  There's no dividing line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level languages on the other.  So if you ask a great hacker how good he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know. If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language from a bad one.  When he was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.  <ImageHere> That territory tends to be picked clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice.  But if this is your attitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado.  As we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door. Others see what they've done and are full of wonder, but the creator is full of worry.  <ImageHere> Design begins by asking, who is this for and what do they need from it?  A good architect, for example, does not begin by creating a design that he then imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring out what they need.Notice I said \"what they need,\" not \"what they want.\"  I don't mean to give the impression that working as a designer means working as  a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client tells you to. They grab your sleeve as you're staring at your phone and say \"will you play with me?\" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise.  So I inverted the 5 regrets, yielding a list of 5 commands     Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you    think; cultivate friendships; be happy. Language designers like to write fast compilers.  It seems to me there is a Laffer curve for government power, just as for tax revenues.

These people need your help.  Symbols differ from strings in that you can test equality by comparing a pointer.8. So I remember his exact words very clearly.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun, and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.  Don't ask them any unnecessary questions.  I don't think this is something intrinsic to programming, though. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time.  There are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure where I'm heading.The amount of cutting is about average. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. [1]The Secret WeaponEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\" and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn.  <ImageHere>  For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google. They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want to sell early.PrognosisWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to that is, some of each.  By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each user's data.   3. Thanks to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Amjad Masad, Ryan Petersen, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.May 2006(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something unique about it?It wouldn't be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other countries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US either.  In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one asked what year or brand it was.  <ImageHere>  A professor at a famous university who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much regardless of the proposal. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. [3]With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition turned a corner. All popular languages are equally good at this. They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home. These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands between them.  That about sums up my experience of graduate school.BoundsHow much are you supposed to like what you do?  Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  <ImageHere>  That's not what makes startups worth the trouble. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question.  No one in an industrialized country encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an adult.  I think a better model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development to a more powerful language instead. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.  And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like.   [4]  Since board seats last about 5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once, that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner per year.  <ImageHere>  You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  Among other things it gives you more options to choose your life's work from.There's not even a tradeoff here.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created    for other people to use.If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are that you're not designing something good, even for idiots. And yet this principle is built into the very structure of   the essays they teach you to write in high school. This is everyday life in Palo Alto. I suspect that very few housing projects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live in them.  This quality may be redundant though; it may be implied by imagination.Sam Altman of Loopt  is one of the most successful alumni, so we asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application that would help us discover more people like him.

[3]The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity. And because you can't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp.  If anyone should know this, Apple should.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to do. Perl programs can be almost cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators are comically long.  Now they're rapidly running out of runway. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together.

When people do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g.  It won't seem so preposterous in 10,000 years.  This idea is even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language. To change the interface both have to agree to change it at once. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.  <ImageHere>  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users. I say \"for what it's worth\" because they never do. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online.  But the better you do, the less this matters.  Many Perl programs probably begin as just a couple library calls stuck together.I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages in the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. This is everyday life in Palo Alto. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since.  If you're writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it may be slightly faster.  Morally, they care about getting the big questions right, but not about observing proprieties. Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straight in the eye and say \"I'm designing a  new dialect of Lisp.\"    I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn't like being asked what they do.  <ImageHere>  One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not. 4.  During the 90s a lot of people    probably thought we'd have some working system for micropayments      by now. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996.  There is a lot more to discover.Notes [1] In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite some progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize a small percentage of statements. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jeff Clavier, David Hornik, Jessica Livingston, Greg Mcadoo, Aydin Senkut, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.Related:September 2007In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.  <ImageHere>  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.  It's them you have to design your site for. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true._____ How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know they don't want to sell, they take the meeting. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice.  Users love a site that's constantly improving. In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing jobs that boosted the median income.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users.

Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders, a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the long term than one who passes.[8] The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations is that we're not professional negotiators, and don't want to turn into them.[9] There are two ways to do  work you love: (a) to make money, then work on what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on stuff you love. But in practice I don't think fast code comes primarily from things you do in the design of the language.  It's the same process that cures diseases: technological progress. What other alternative is there?  To answer that we have to reach back into history again, though this time not so far.  <ImageHere> When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble.  The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom.  People who get rich from startups fund new ones.  Besides, they don't want to offend Big Company by refusing to meet.Well, I'll tell you what they want.  Pen and paper wick ideas.The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius. But there are some domains where performance can be measured, and in those detecting bias is straightforward. Gay marriage, for or against?  This group says one thing.  They're already stuck with a seller's market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still haven't invested. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014.  <ImageHere>  This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Maxim magazine publishes an annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups and grisly accidents. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects have in common.  Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments of a hundred thousand or two.  No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any outside help. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world. If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the rule rather than the exception.  <ImageHere>  And so the study of ancient texts became less about ancientness and more about texts.The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern texts?  The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors. For example, I added condition (c) in \"A Way to Detect Bias\"  after readers pointed out that I'd omitted it.  Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but as an animation with multiple frames. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done.  <ImageHere>  This way you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code, but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would be in a traditional research department.  Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be.I wouldn't quite call it \"Bubble 2.0\" just because VCs are eager to invest again. [1]That has worked for Google so far.  Mikey likes it.There's another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common.  After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty.  But that's not what you're trying to do in an essay. So one can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic San Francisco number?",

But they may not realize that such laws will do more harm than good.Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night, I'd want to go out and investigate. At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them. Similar tricks may shorten other types of expressions.We can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by making indentation significant.  But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.Reporters like definitive statements.  But how do you avoid mistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so it has other defaults.  <ImageHere>  In fact what you do (or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman road-builder. Me among them.But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have.  What he sees are merely weird languages.  You couldn't just do what you wanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.  Each is, by itself, enough to kill you.  But when you choose a language, you're also choosing a community. The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.The founders sometimes think they know. But my instincts tell me you don't have to worry much. For the next couple years I was on a roll.  So VCs who invest in angel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels who invest in them.  If parents will let their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.  One is that these users are the people they want as employees.  <ImageHere> From the outside that seems like what startups do.  And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a pain. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. It comes with the territory. Remember, hackers are lazy.It could be an even bigger win to have core language support for server-based applications.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business.  A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100? [1]Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense.  <ImageHere> You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old.  The expert told him that it would be a waste of time, that programming languages don't become popular or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how good his language was, no one would use it.  You can't trust authorities.  Kids a certain age would point into the case and say that they wanted yellow. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone.  Financing a startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt stupidest of all.  But ambitious programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than going to work at a big company.  That's not what makes startups worth the trouble.  <ImageHere> A knowledge of human nature is certainly part of wisdom.  Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard them.  Think about what you have to do to get into college, for example. Lewis in The Boston Globe.  Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  And they make a lot more investments per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them doubly alarming to VCs.  And it's not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas aren't the ones that win.  [6]If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full of security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual applications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating memory. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kampala number?",

But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, or Boston, or Seattle.  If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very indignant.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly high.  But now it worked to our advantage.  In an opera it's common for one person to write the libretto and another to write the music. Randomness destroys the ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism.[2] If you don't like using an expression, you can make the same point using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you don't control your nth-order desires. Just don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of this type. Their lives are short too.  But I tried to read Plato and Aristotle.  <ImageHere>  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a fraction of the things he would have liked to.  You can write programs that manipulate them.  It happens naturally to anyone who does good work.  If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit.  Now it means a smaller, younger, more technical group that just       decided to make something great. [2] For boys, at least, certain kinds of horrors are fascinating.  If you lack commitment, you'll just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to your competitors but not to you. Authoritarian countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful.  The nature of the problems change.  They remind us where we come from. Multics and Common Lisp were big-bang projects, and Unix and MacLisp were organic growth projects.10 Redesign\"The best writing is rewriting,\" wrote E.  <ImageHere> Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. I'd never imagined it was even possible. He always seems to land on his feet.   But for some reason we treat this skill differently.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.  And they think of it as something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created (and might be created unequally).In fact, wealth is not money. So most hackers will tend to wait until a language has been around for a couple years before even considering using it.Inventors of wonderful new things are often surprised to discover this, but you need time to get any message through to people. They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them a certain problem can't be solved. Expert hackers  can tell a good language when they see one, and they'll use it.  <ImageHere> (I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c), that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.  When people do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g.  But this seems the exception.  But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income.  Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be important.My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful in some worldly way.  \"The suit is back,\" it begins.Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms.  <ImageHere> With the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before.  We're not hearing about Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows apps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming languages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for our work.2.  It's fabulous. B. 1300), with \"number\" replaced by \"gender.\"  Plus ca change.Wolter, Allan (trans), Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings, Nelson, 1963, p. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI.  I'm not sure how much credit to give him.  The way I studied for exams in these classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and work out the answers in advance.  Mostly we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we then trade for the forms of wealth we want. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Vienna number?",

Someone proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then it gradually takes over the world.Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. If the far left opinion on some matter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's opinion on every question will be near 50. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them. Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading  drafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming.  Fortunately if this does happen it will take years.The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which is good news for you. They don't always, of course.  <ImageHere>  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who's fastest. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best ones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a lot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific group of other people: people not as smart as the language designer. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong.Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B.  <ImageHere> To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you're actually quite sure of.  It can be either a compliment or an insult.  Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money.  Often as not these large   investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing it.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of the hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or Xerox.  This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many.  It was my fault I hadn't learned anything. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself.  But that is not how conversations with corp dev work.  <ImageHere>  One wrote:    While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they   place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop   applications as I would like.  When a VC firm can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about which they do.  And that means there may be a struggle ahead. I wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily; starting a startup can be very stressful.  Err on the side of generosity.In How to Start a Startup I advised startups never to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any other company offer a cheaper, easier solution. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went.  To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy.  <ImageHere>  More and more we were starting to hear about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have cycles to spare.  If you  don't and a competitor does, you're in trouble.iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense. And that means they need to get as much of the company as they can in each one.  So if you're the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit. If he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much food.   [5] Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy.  But I think he underestimated the variation between programmers. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Tokyo number?",

But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious.  And when you have one this has real effects on the design of the language.  A government that asks \"How can we build a silicon valley?\" has probably ensured failure by the way they framed the question. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked.

That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.  <ImageHere> It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. It wasn't that they were stupid.  \"Wise\" means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice.  They don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small. They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want to sell early.PrognosisWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to that is, some of each.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes, have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics. In the past, a competitor might use patents to prevent you from selling a copy of something they made, but they couldn't prevent you from taking one apart to see how it worked.  <ImageHere> In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in  point.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize libraries. So most people pre-emptively lower their expectations.  But they aren't all equivalent, not by a long shot.  They're also getting bigger, and this can be dangerous. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so baseball players make more than poets. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp.  They would say that.  By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online.  You can say either (using Arc syntax)(if foo (= x 1) (= x 2))or(= x (if foo 1 2))7.  <ImageHere>  Immediately Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they'd discovered. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time.  In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called \"corruption\") when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich.Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in that government office was a recognized route to wealth.  Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income.  You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. [4]Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.  <ImageHere>  By the time they reach an age to think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one's work.  Or perhaps it's because so many startup founders have backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.A large part of YC's function is to accelerate that process.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google Maps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" was coined.2. M., \"Slavery in the Ancient World,\" Economic History Review, 2:9 (1956), 185-199, reprinted in Finley, M.  The designer is human too.Notice all this time I've been talking about \"the designer.\" Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.   The idea of evolution is another. But you can rarely get it down to zero. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kampala number?",

And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  But now it worked to our advantage.  This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon.[3] Different sections of the Times vary so much in their standards that they're practically different papers.  So unless you're fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job career. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.)  The kind of power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more powerful language in it.  It was not the teachers. That's the whole point of technology.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll hear about it.  <ImageHere>  It's more important to grow fast.  But I think I have finally solved the problem.  It's not just a synonym for annoying.  If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what.Almost everyone's initial plan is broken. Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months. Much as a vaccine can be.  So I hope people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers were similarly naive. But a very proper subset.  They confuse it with money.  There hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared.  This was the only kind of work available at the time. At least not the painting department. Hackers like to hack, and hacking means getting inside things and second guessing the original designer.Let yourself be second guessed. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.  They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth.  <ImageHere> Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore.  Now high school kids could write software or design web sites. Now that I didn't need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision. If we start from the premise that there's no such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.We'd better start by saying what good taste is.  If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of thinking was.  But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.Don't decide too soon.  Jessica and I bicycled to University Ave in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus.  <ImageHere> I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school I never read the books we were assigned.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously they still view office space as a badge of rank.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry, all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in  grad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash   out partially in the Series A round. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room.  Software isn't like music or books.  There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious. When you run a forum, you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you.  <ImageHere>  One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's full of bugs.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.  The things I've written just for myself are no good.  The first names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally, but it seems lame to use them.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusive results.  And if you find yourself asking \"should we allow users to do x?\" just  answer \"yes\" whenever you're unsure.  But if this is your attitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.

It's exciting to chase things and exciting to try to guess answers.  Kill-or-cure strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.  At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobs offer internships, and those that do don't teach you much more about the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you get better results if you use flexible media. The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers.  <ImageHere>  And perhaps even worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  Your boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularly well in a few.  Unlike high tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it turns out to be a mistake.This is why hackers worry.  And because of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared. At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be zero rather than negative.  Our ancestors were giants. It will be worth making i/o fast.   But their tastes can't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\" The thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas, cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  <ImageHere> It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.  I'm not sure why. Treating indentation as significant would eliminate this common source of bugs as well as making programs shorter.Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read.  But although I started using it out of loyalty to the home team, I've become a genuine addict. Kant.[13] Wittgenstein asserted a sort of mastery to which the inhabitants of early 20th century Cambridge seem to have been peculiarly vulnerable—perhaps partly because so many had been raised religious and then stopped believing, so had a vacant space in their heads for someone to tell them what to do (others chose Marx or Cardinal Newman), and partly because a quiet, earnest place like Cambridge in that era had no natural immunity to messianic figures, just as European politics then had no natural immunity to dictators.[14] This is actually from the Ordinatio of Duns Scotus (ca. People build whole careers on some ideas. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  <ImageHere>  Most people implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And it is a particularly valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  You won't need to advertise, because your users will do it for you.This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are.  That was not, probably, how McCarthy thought of it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications.  We fell    into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it   adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old   medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get   figured out. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. (It would be hard to make it worse.) But I think there are areas where existing languages would be easier to beat.  I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.  <ImageHere> They like to get you to the point where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying to convince you to sell. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein.  In most places the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  Then you want to do something else—even something mindless.  C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for their own designers to use.  Its retail price is about $220,000.[14] If asked to choose which was more expensive, a well-preserved 1989 Lincoln Town Car ten-passenger limousine ($5,000) or a 2004 Mercedes S600 sedan ($122,000), the average Edwardian might well guess wrong.[15] To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to talk about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Amman number?",

The way I studied for exams in these classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and work out the answers in advance. You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific, and then gradually make them more general.  Most are only allowed to invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willing to act as lead investor.Not BuildingsIf you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings. It seemed obvious that this was the future. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm. [14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them.  <ImageHere>  The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about the world.  Workers were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.  Which presumably means that what they're taught in school is rounding error  compared to what they pick up on their own.Indeed, English classes may even be harmful. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me.  Forty-two years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to work for Intel.So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't make anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links back to Shockley.  The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him, hackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  And the m.o.  And if you don't, you need to fix something.  <ImageHere>  And yet if I had to write down everything I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a page. They launch it with no marketing and initially have only a few (fanatically devoted) users. \"Good\" and \"bad\" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated, so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the former.  Among other things it gives you more options to choose your life's work from.There's not even a tradeoff here. You don't need to look in the manual much.  You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two.This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing.  It could be simply that many famous scientists worked when collaboration was less common.Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.  <ImageHere> You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics and still be a good mathematician.

At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question.  The Metaphysics is among the least read of all famous books. The   chief lit a cigarette.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things.  Every language probably has a word meaning \"how one feels when things are going well,\" but different cultures react differently when things go well. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this.  Maybe the answer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design whatever object systems they want as libraries.3. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. And indeed, if you're looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken beliefs are a good place to find them.  <ImageHere>  A lot of people in the startup world want to believe that.  [1]Our PR firm was one of the best in the business.  But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something you can fix by writing library functions.[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top; it's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial order.[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  They hope further investment will save them.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at this, in part simply by having high standards.  Better to release something and let them tell you.Wufoo took this to heart and released their form-builder before the underlying database.  But if you had to change something, what would it be?If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination.

The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex, revenge.  The startup hubs in the US are all young-feeling towns.

If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same. [3]It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. Computers are responsible for the problem.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong.

That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings.  There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.  That's the way to approach technology—and  as business includes an ever larger technological component, the right way to do business.The fact that Google is a \"Web 2.0\" company shows that, while meaningful, the term is also rather bogus.  <ImageHere> I didn't write essays.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers. Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straight in the eye and say \"I'm designing a  new dialect of Lisp.\"    I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn't like being asked what they do. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.  Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great.

Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations, if it was not too expensive.4. [1] But it's not out of laziness that I haven't prepared. Many a hacker will want to tweak your semantic model in a way that you never imagined.  [5]What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.

If you have something impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see. If they're going to build something, they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building an iPhone app.So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple continues to maltreat them.    We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of   pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests   of contradictory and confusing truths.  But ambitious programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than going to work at a big company.  A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover, a quick 10x return.  <ImageHere>  They don't know how many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have done well if they'd survived.  As soon as we heard they'd been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded breakfast cereal, they were in.  And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good programmers, very fluid.  The one possible exception are things like working in fast food, which have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them.  In fact what you do (or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman road-builder.  And yet if you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories. The word \"paradigm\" is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted.  <ImageHere>  They know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do. If he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much food.  They're not.  If there's some mundane problem getting in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive, just take it and get on with more important things.  And yet if I had to write down everything I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a page. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.  One sense of \"normal\" is statistically normal: what everyone else does. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it.  The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent.  A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business.   Bottom-up programming suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people work as toolmakers. That sounds hipper than Lisp.  <ImageHere> But it certainly wasn't true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that students were serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.Classical scholarship had also changed.  None of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  In that respect they're more like the small man of Confucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from starvation. For example, they'll almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll take it.  At least, it seems likely enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  It seems like the type that matters most is imagination.  When I heard this, I thought, these guys are doomed. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too.  Founders never really liked giving up as much equity as VCs wanted.   [3]Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have less partner per investment.  An organization that wins by exercising power starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  <ImageHere>  Reddit now has almost half a million unique visitors a month. Apple itself did. My father told me so.  But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  His office was nicknamed the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan. And yet this principle is built into the very structure of   the essays they teach you to write in high school.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the startup world.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing the startup.You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size of company you work for.  But most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than underestimating it. Tcl is the scripting language of Tk. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Paris number?",

Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it.  In a project like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems all fall into a pattern, as in a signal. In fact, the language encourages you to be an equal participant in its design. [2]Such ideas are not guaranteed to work.  But when you do something so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also called a hack. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose a major.  <ImageHere> The most amusing thing written during this period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is, I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.Around 1000 Europe began to catch its breath. I suspect that working for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics and still be a good mathematician. And probably for the same reason: that the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous lives.If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. Work with people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question.  <ImageHere> Good support for threads will enable all the users to share a single heap.  Essays should do the opposite. You'd also have a very boring life.  The word is used more often in the former than the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more common than brilliant ones.Believe it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are also connected.  I carried it home and plugged it in, and it booted.  In the process of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that \"2.0\" referred to.  That no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism are true, knows all too well.)One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people in general is that hackers are more  politically incorrect.  <ImageHere> Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is in software.  He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn.  And that will cause the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually to erode.[4] Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round board, consisting of two founders and one VC. It felt like I was doing life right.  \"It is a truth universally acknowledged?\"  Long words for the first sentence of a love story.Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard. Common Lisp is not.The good news is, it's not Lisp that sucks, but Common Lisp. At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were really recipes for wisdom or intelligence. That's why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors.  They're not Goody Two-Shoes type good. It has to be there. Particularly lions.  <ImageHere> The first, obviously, is that if you don't have enough density, the chance meetings don't happen.  Not quite.  This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon.[3] Different sections of the Times vary so much in their standards that they're practically different papers. Instead of desktop applications, you'd run Java \"applets\" delivered from a server.This plan collapsed under its own weight.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader   something he didn't already know.  Within months I was using it to make money as a freelance programmer.  And while it  makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies,  studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about  hitting outliers, are not one of them. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries.  But certainly a large part of it is learned. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Jakarta number?",

Now it's the career of thousands.  They just wanted to make the point that the web mattered again. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how reasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to     do, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would make as much of a difference as having first class functions or recursion or even keyword parameters.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious new things they could do. They seem wrong.   [4]Likewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we're asking for trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called \"intelligence.\" And whatever its components, they're not all innate.  That's where speed comes from in practice. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question.  <ImageHere>  My guess is a significant number.[4] After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:\"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. TryShould you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound pretty hard. Then I'm worried.  But as knowledge has grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.  <ImageHere>   And this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people like managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model. Because if there is such a thing as good art, it's easy to tell which of two people has better taste.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there generating it. I wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily; starting a startup can be very stressful.  But it's the same process at work.  It's not the kind of place nerds like.Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but no rich people.  In a project like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems all fall into a pattern, as in a signal.  It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor.  <ImageHere> The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type.  It's possible to buy expensive, handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. I'm not sure why.  Young people don't want to live in the suburbs.Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned into new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new startup he was involved with.  That's why I write them.So there's another difference between essays and the things you have to write in school.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want. [2] In fact, if you read the dictator's speech it sounds uncannily like a prophecy of the App Store.  <ImageHere>  We react like children, with smiles and laughter. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants to buy you.  What little original thought there was took place in lulls between constant wars and had something of the character of the thoughts of parents with a new baby. This is a feature of brains, not a bug.  The disadvantage of this route is that it's slow and uncertain. If you only have ten readers who care, that's fine.  Off, quiet.  If your company seems evil, the best programmers won't work for you.  They must genuinely like one another, and work well together.  F = ma for example.  They're going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.  (The use of the term \"recitation\" for sections in some colleges is a fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that they're too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.DifferentI deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it's worth being wise. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Sofia number?",

You're worrying about construction delays at your London office instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.  And technology for targeting ads continues to improve. Notes[1] This technique wouldn't work if the selection process looked for different things from different types of applicants—for example, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women based on their appearance.[2] As Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most  successful investment, Uber, from the study. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the founders.  Almost nobody understands this yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists). It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners.  <ImageHere>  Reddit now has almost half a million unique visitors a month. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.  Since people interested in the latter are interested in it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  If you're writing something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest thing that drove us to start building web apps.At least we know now what it would take to break Apple's lock.   [14]  The singularity I've described is not going away. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners.  That's why the successful ones make great things. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  When you ask that question, you find that open source operating systems already have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably Perl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects. At least not the painting department.  We funded them because we liked the founders so much.  <ImageHere>  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that they performed one. Surely all smart people would be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.Because philosophy's flaws turned away the sort of people who might have corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating. If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment business, that might be different. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996.  The company is ultimately doomed.  One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is \"show, don't tell.\" Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth, or break his pencil in half.  But they're doing it because byte code is a convenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because byte code is in itself a good idea.  Most people implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  But this seems the exception.  <ImageHere>  Fortunately if this does happen it will take years.The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which is good news for you. Lisp programs are  trees of expressions, each of which returns a value.  Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the metaphysical speculation department, the people who used to do literary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like \"literary theory,\" \"critical theory,\" and when they're feeling ambitious, plain \"theory.\"  The writing is the familiar word salad:    Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which   express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that   corresponds to the conceptual mode, and consequently do not express   precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be   moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive   is not something in the thing as such. In fact it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot.  Revenue will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth predicts x% revenue growth.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows that pretty clearly.  <ImageHere> But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people.  If your company makes software to do x, have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and another that uses these tools to write the applications.  If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.Ok, so life actually is short.  Or more precisely, in Trevor's office. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software.  They can practically read one another's minds.  If I already have momentum on some project, I can work in noisy places.  The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old it's mixed together with a lot of random junk.The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Chicago number?",

If you want to define a plus for a new type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function to add them.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken.  It's no defense to say that the novel or the chair   is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.And yet, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making what the user tells you to. White said, \"good writing is rewriting.\"  I didn't realize this when I was in school. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it.  A doctor, P.  So how do you know when you're working on real stuff? [8]I know how I know. Then I'm worried. Even the people who have the new ideas undervalue them initially.  <ImageHere> In fact, the book can start as online documentation.  They're like a food that's not merely healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things you've already eaten. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine.  Perhaps it's because startups are less of a zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed by competitors. In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp features like lexical closures and rest parameters.[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly neutral that they're really works of anthropology. So this set me thinking.  An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a   question.  How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn't even have y.By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. Perl was there because it was originally a tool for system administrators, and yours had already installed it.Being available means more than being installed, though.  <ImageHere> Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are. In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.  Don't companies realize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office environment is supposed to be something that helps you work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle, even the CEO. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed to pass the written exam. An active profiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a program's running, or even make sounds that tell what's happening.Sound is a good cue to problems.  That principle, like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,    turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long forgotten origins.  Each year.  For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby.  Also, you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will have more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing? That's what you're addicted to.  <ImageHere>  All we can do is encourage people to do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.If there's something people still won't do, it seems as if society just has to make do without.  Even colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things went wrong with them. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do.  But by the modern era such questions were answered as well as they were ever going to be.  The human body is a strange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it.  And that's a lot of work. In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything false (\"6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment\").  <ImageHere> [4] Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer.  Mistake number four.  One of the less honorable was to shock people. Randomness destroys the ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism.[2] If you don't like using an expression, you can make the same point using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you don't control your nth-order desires. So you get a language that talks down to you.  Recursion existed as a mathematical concept before Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to support it. The path it has discovered, winding as it is, represents the most economical route to the sea.The river's algorithm is simple.  The remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the software in one day (in Python, incidentally).For Trevor, that's par for the course.  But most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than underestimating it.  Think about your own experience: most links you follow lead to something lame. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Maputo number?",

But if you yourself don't have good taste,  how are you going to recognize a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.  You can get the software for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that programming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  This was an era when small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and huge economies of scale. They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are the source of America's wealth and power.Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be obeyed. Nothing is deprecated, or retained for compatibility.  <ImageHere>  And a particularly overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced house style.If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now that software development has evolved from a small number of big releases to a constant stream of small ones.  It sounded promising.  In fact they were more law schools.  Few people are suited to running a startup, and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand), so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the optimal state of affairs. Nat.  A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover, a quick 10x return.  But unfortunately that was not the conclusion Aristotle's successors derived from works like the Metaphysics. Committees yield bad design.  Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or heresy.[3] Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  <ImageHere>  Some might say it's part of science, but it's not part of any specific science; it's literally meta-physics (in our sense of \"meta\").  They don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small.  I just want to make a language that will be good to program in.  The most    successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff away for free. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. $1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number of lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially new, but I'm excited about its potential.  They hope further investment will save them.  <ImageHere> Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp.  To programmers, \"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer wants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses.  That kind of switch often takes people by surprise.I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too early. It was exciting for a while.  It's not something you read looking for a specific answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  You could not nest statements. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time leads to discontentment.That's particularly worth remembering. But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.  This could become more common.You can do it on a smaller scale without moving. The idea of them making startup investments is comic. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite trend.  <ImageHere> People who work for startups start their own.  If you have decent growth, you'll win in the end, no matter how obscure you are now.  What's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one. I think a bigger problem is that a hacker's idea of a good programming language is not the same as most language designers'.Between the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. Recursion. [14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Madrid number?",

EBay didn't win by paying less for servers than their competitors.Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a growth industry in the mid twentieth century. The next generation of computer technology has often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing what they expected to be the next generation of business computer. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants to buy you.  And because this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive to it.  It's because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by definition have odd ideas.Conversely, a town that gets praised for being \"solid\" or representing \"traditional values\" may be a fine place to live, but it's never going to succeed as a startup hub.

To someone who hasn't learned the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive: as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it.  <ImageHere>  And surprisingly often they succeed.This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful forces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced professional whose full time job is to push you down it.Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly brutal.  Users had been climbing in through   the window for years before Apple finally moved the door.[5] Hint: the way to create a web-based alternative to Office may not be to write every component yourself, but to establish a protocol for web-based apps to share a virtual home directory spread across multiple servers. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are.One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive. It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology together in a place they liked enough to stay.CompetingOf course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original one didn't: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  Quoted in:Monk, Ray, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, Penguin, 1991, p.  <ImageHere> But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders.  He was arguably the first scientist.[6] Brooks, Rodney, Programming in Common Lisp, Wiley, 1985, p.  And if you find yourself asking \"should we allow users to do x?\" just  answer \"yes\" whenever you're unsure. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. [4] Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary.  Not just founders, but investors too.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't. Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they're first launched — programming languages especially.  <ImageHere>  And anything you come across that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably surprise most readers.For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that because you can only judge computer programmers by working with them, no one knows in programming who the heroes should be.  Immediately Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they'd discovered. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose a major.  Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do.

And it's likely to.  I had to go back n paragraphs and start over in another direction.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to.  But Apple doesn't understand that either. You don't need anyone's permission.It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years, till some change makes it explode. We didn't know how VC firms were organized. And that means, perhaps surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task: a program to automate some system administration task, or generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format to another. I think you should always do this when you can.  <ImageHere> Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages are how people talk to computers.  It won't seem so preposterous in 10,000 years.  But it's not just the user who's human. Much as a vaccine can be. Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed for. You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  I think I see now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.WordsI did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  If you consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate fact is that change is hard to predict.  Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to   be good. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. I was framing the question wrong.  Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments of a hundred thousand or two. That suggests they know something you don't.  <ImageHere> A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone. Thanks to the Cambridge Union for inviting me, and to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.

When watches had mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we'd been.  You can feel the difference between working for a company with 100 employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a  marginal medium at first.  I think hacking is more like architecture. I assumed I'd learn what in college.The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  <ImageHere> In fact, that's an understatement.  When watches had mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time. [1] Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in groups of several hundred.  It may turn out that this whole battleground gets bypassed. The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use a trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which happens to be written in the new language.2 External FactorsLet's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect the popularity of a programming language.  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's Principia is, but the way a garbled message is.Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment. It may also help to have persistent objects and/or language level support for lazy loading.9 TimeThe last ingredient a popular language needs is time.  This was, I can now see, a doomed undertaking, because they weren't really saying anything.  At each step, flow down.  Most programmers are told what language to use by someone else.  <ImageHere>  The teacher doesn't. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model. One of the most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you've actually written. But elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses, I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers. The book should be thin, well-written, and full of good examples. You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into any number of other kinds of work.It's also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Dakar number?",

No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any outside help.  Lower down the list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in Austin.  But it would not be the first time that measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had the opposite of the intended effect.There is such a thing as Americanness. Why should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998 I took a snapshot of Viaweb's site. And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work  doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual currency of research papers. The distinction between expressions and statements was entrenched.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.Our secret weapon was similar.  <ImageHere>  It is true that all they really care about is doing interesting work.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them, at least.Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory in one lifetime. [16]Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor, not increasing it.  For example, I know that Richard and Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process   scheduling within Scheme 48.3.  In fact, let's make it an RFS.  That's not what makes startups worth the trouble.  Food has been transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the buck, and you can see the results in any town in America.  <ImageHere>  The philosophers whose works they cover would be rolling in their graves at that. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry, all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in  grad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash   out partially in the Series A round.  Indeed, helps is far too weak a word.  When cigarettes first appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through a previously isolated population. He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language.  It didn't work out as I'd hoped.  Lisp code, after it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax.  We told him we'd fund him if he did something else.  <ImageHere> We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf.  Wikipedia may be the most famous.  And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like.  But the new version number led to some awkwardness in the short term. Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered.  Buildings to be constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.What made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you could actually make the finished work from the prototype. But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same.  <ImageHere>  But they don't realize just how    fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral damage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very little noise. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen.4 HackabilityThere is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being able to do what you want.  The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't.  Hiring people is rarely the way to fix that. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that's the last time Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base.Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they can use it.  They're so desperate for \"content\" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Lagos number?",

But there are different kinds of prosperity. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.  <ImageHere> If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation.   Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong.  IBM seemed a lot more frightening in those days, but they were friendlier to developers than Apple is now.[3] He couldn't even afford a monitor.  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator.  How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds of academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect.  <ImageHere> If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only get 1.5x.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you. Others see what they've done and are full of wonder, but the creator is full of worry.  There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic.  The most important quality in a startup founder is determination.  You're going to hit a lot of obstacles.  To programmers, \"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer wants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses.  <ImageHere> And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that's the last time Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base.Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they can use it. Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.  Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury of turning down money.Fortunately, more and more startups will.  Perhaps more importantly, you'll get into the habit of doing things well.Another test you can use is: always produce.  And they're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't change much, like human nature.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of them, because I find new books to read en route.  If you have something impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural to me, except possibly for math. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Brussels number?",

I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex.  But VCs never offered that option.Now startups have another alternative.  (This is true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn't as obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone's used to those.)Thanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Aaron Swartz created a scraped feed of the essays page.November 2021(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)When I was a kid, I'd have said there wasn't. I certainly did.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in a lot of fields.  <ImageHere>  Or perhaps it's because so many startup founders have backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.A large part of YC's function is to accelerate that process.  But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  If you're designing a tool, for example, you can design it for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design for one group might be bad for another.   With a tractor an energetic farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team of horses.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up.  <ImageHere>  Venture investors are driven by exit strategies.  Almost nobody understands this yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).  I've never heard of a case where it worked.What people outside the software world may not realize is that Worse is Better is found throughout the arts.  Raising a traditional series A round has in the past taken weeks, if not months. 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The dream language is  beautiful, clean, and terse.   He's determined to get downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or even backwards to get there.The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of Greplin.  I think hacking is more like architecture.  Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries were drawn on paper with ink wash.  <ImageHere>  For example, MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats.  I encourage you to follow that thread.  If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on.  So a company that found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would be very successful.  There are no shops on the island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  But I think all of us in the computer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on.Thanks to Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Sarah Harlin for reading earlier versions of this talk. It's a mere hatchling. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things.  Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first.  Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being a painter, and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it snapped the leash of credulity. The source code of all the libraries is readily available.  It's inconvenient to do something expensive and custom.The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  <ImageHere> And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life.  If you don't seem like you have the potential to go public, you won't be able to use VCs to drive up the valuation of an angel round.There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called signalling risk.  IBM seemed a lot more frightening in those days, but they were friendlier to developers than Apple is now.[3] He couldn't even afford a monitor.  And because of supply and demand, they pay especially well. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman.  This is the tone of someone writing down to their audience.Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic. They're not just experimental error.  Smart people will go wherever other smart people are. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Amsterdam number?",

Anything that can be implicit, should be.The individual tokens should be short as well.  Our ancestors were giants. You don't want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. It's terrifying to build something big from scratch.  The expected value of a startup is the percentage chance it's Google.  I told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous    fees.  Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.  At the time it was supposed to mean using \"the web as a platform,\" which I took to refer to web-based applications.  So what if some of the money would go to the   founders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is unthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work growing the company.  <ImageHere> So learn and use its full range. Even the people who have the new ideas undervalue them initially. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums.  Food has been transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the buck, and you can see the results in any town in America.  The other end of the spectrum is designing chairs.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky to get paid three times as much. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application programs used to mean writing desktop software. You don't need anyone's permission.It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years, till some change makes it explode.  You can't just treat a patient's symptoms.  If I already have momentum on some project, I can work in noisy places. For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.  And it turned out the idea was on the right side of crazy after all.  <ImageHere> This only seems unfair if it comes as a surprise.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. cit., p.  It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it.  So by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don't care about valuations in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.[7] Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you'll never need to raise more money. Gay marriage, for or against?  This group says one thing. That territory tends to be picked clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about which problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good solution.  And if you don't, you need to fix something.  <ImageHere>  Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of. The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.  Quoted in:Monk, Ray, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, Penguin, 1991, p.  When we got to the yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran into Yuri Sagalov.  When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turn out not to want. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.  Civil liberties make countries rich.  And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates: they are trained to be able to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it   as they can. Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the L-word.  <ImageHere> Paintings didn't become obsolete. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.  I was trying to make it efficient.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies overspend on different things.  It sounded promising.  You turn the fan back on, and the noise starts again.  Really bringing books is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good—that what I need them for is distraction. In high school he designed computers on paper for fun.   The most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.com, where    you can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest you have sit through a movie.At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord it over users.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects of it that are unenviable. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Belgrade number?",

So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. They don't just compete for startups; they also compete for investors.  Reading P.G. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb.  You don't have to tell anyone you're doing philosophy.If it seems like a daunting task to do philosophy, here's an encouraging thought.  You had to grow fast or die. [5] And the reason we do is that they've been diverging.  But a programming language isn't just a format.   So to the extent you can preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it well.  But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  <ImageHere>  Basically, what \"Ajax\" means is \"Javascript now works.\"  And that in turn means that web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop ones.As you read this, a whole new generation of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of good things. One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding whether to allow deductions is that, if something is fun, it isn't work.  It's what bias means.For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased against female founders.  I'd much rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along a prescribed course.So what's interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.  Ideas beget ideas. You need the young hacker's naive faith in his abilities, and at the same time the veteran's skepticism.  So this alternative device probably couldn't win on general appeal.  <ImageHere>  Nearly all the code in any program you write is code that's specific to your application.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints, partly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and partly so I don't worry about losing them.I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.Reporters like definitive statements.  But since their size made them perfect for use in high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the impression the short story was flourishing. About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain. Lisp 1.5 didn't have macros, for example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a couple years using Lisp to write real programs.  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users. But rationally one shouldn't.  <ImageHere>  In a rapidly growing market, you don't worry too much about efficiency. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow.  If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer?  Honestly, no.But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.Sometimes I can think with noise.  [4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. I've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  In the meantime the founders were terribly overworked. [2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.  <ImageHere>  \"The suit is back,\" it begins.Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms.  I told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous    fees.  Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals.  Maybe what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register to get at it.  But something is missing: individual initiative. You never have to type an unnecessary character, or even to use the shift key much.Using big abstractions you can write the first version of a program very quickly.  And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  This is easier in most other fields. I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth, and it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Khartoum number?",

This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But another kind of efficiency will be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users you can support per processor.  You're given this marvellous thing, and then poof, it's taken away.  Imagine waking up after such an operation.  Three year olds aren't smart.  None of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget that Hilbert had confirmed it too. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again.  <ImageHere>  So why do they need to fix anything?They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because they make such great hardware. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone.  Many of these people never come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone else created earlier.  They're way more dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security. It must be terse, simple, and hackable. A symbol type.  And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. See, we love big juicy lumbar disc   herniations, but they hate hypertension....\"  It's hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy (except literally).  Or better still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that one.The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades before it was associated with technology.  <ImageHere>  If a design represents an idea that   fits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the user's head too.Related:  Want to start a startup?  Get funded by Y Combinator. And it's largely because they got more of the best people that Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?  Partly because they can afford to be.  A song on an LP is physically stamped into the plastic. I found that in a lot of classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape to make good exam questions. Something you're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you can always tell.  As Ben Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is what life is made of.So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money.  As a rule their interest is a function of growth.  Workers were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.  <ImageHere>  Who are all those people?  They have no idea.  But it makes all the difference that it's concentrated in one individual.When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid, what are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined by what buyers want. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem. Lisp still has a lot of latent respect among the very best hackers — the ones who took 6.001 and understood it, for example. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time.  Why is that so?  Is there some way to beat this limitation?I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires a dictator. The idea of them making startup investments is comic.  Her list seems plausible.  <ImageHere> So she decided to compile a book of  interviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. Only those who've tried it know how lonely.  Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do.  Food has been transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the buck, and you can see the results in any town in America. Hackers would think a lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string libraries and good OS support.7 SyntaxCould a language with Lisp's syntax, or more precisely, lack of syntax, ever become popular? I don't know the answer to this question. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC investments is dictated by the structure of VC funds, not the needs of startups. Happens all the time.

The mere prospect of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on hard problems. First Round Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups with female founders outperformed those without by 63%. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes.  Even colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things went wrong with them. I'd only started Viaweb because I needed the money.  When you travel to a rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank accounts to tell which kind you're in.  We had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of my parents smoked. You don't need to look in the manual much.  <ImageHere> And if you're doing really well, you can safely talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high, and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll be confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle.  And because of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers.  Not quite. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too.  And it is a particularly valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  That's their secret.  You don't need to know this stuff to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to  anyone who wants to understand the essence of Lisp  both in the sense of its origins and its semantic core.    And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus group than hackers, because they come closest of any group I know to embodying it.  <ImageHere> And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer.  When we got to the yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran into Yuri Sagalov.  If you could attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere, you could reproduce Silicon Valley.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell from the case. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years.  We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral    enough.  Which means that as the world becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a normal life will be driven ever further apart.  After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her.  What's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.  <ImageHere> [5] My latest trick is taking long hikes.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do.  Design is not just for humans, but for individual humans. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.  I'm not sure why this is so. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting.  Can that be done?  Probably.One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital firms. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly.  <ImageHere>  \"Perfect'' eyesight means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  So a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design.  Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each? It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who want to work that hard.The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that should be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the amount of wealth that can be created.  In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney.  Hardy's boast that number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.   [5] Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy.  Not quite. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Port Louis number?",

Startups make wealth, which means they make things people want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want, we are nowhere near it.  Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays each time you release a new version.Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful when they submit a new version to the App Store.  Just not now. Just wait till you've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do it for more than half the agreed upon price. gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g. 17.)[12] Though Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously improvident and was troubled by debts all his life.[13] A Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.  <ImageHere> The big bang guys are smooth and confident and respected by the VCs.  Maybe there was some kind of connection. He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.  In the early era, philology actually mattered.  I think if you looked around you'd find that   a lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  It was simply a fad. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss represents your entire group.   In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we thought it was too crazy.  <ImageHere> Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.  You need this for everyone: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site.  Seneca (Ep. If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because it's still made with this software.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders to make them take off, and it's gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.  Which means anyone who wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right than most people would in a casual conversation.  <ImageHere> They like to get you to the point where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying to convince you to sell. This impressive-sounding thing called an \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past.  Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world.  The drawbacks will only become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of malaise.And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like the Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority of the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to. They don't always, of course. For historical reasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist.  <ImageHere> When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you can always tell. Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place, and then gradually refine this initial sketch.In most fields, prototypes have traditionally been made out of different materials.  But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something you can fix by writing library functions.[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top; it's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial order.[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.  And anything you come across that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably surprise most readers.For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that because you can only judge computer programmers by working with them, no one knows in programming who the heroes should be. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many.

I personally am interested in writing a language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the additional suggestion that the application should not consist of writing the compiler for your language, unless your language happens to be intended for writing compilers.]4.  It's also what causes smart people to be curious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so disinterested as we might think.So while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications to be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.The reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the Metaphysics was partly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most abstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure.  This is not just a heuristic for detecting bias.  <ImageHere> An optimism shield has to be pierced too.  They're like a food that's not merely healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things you've already eaten. It's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more \"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets.We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want to\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain experts. Sometimes, just like a river, you run up against a blank wall. Programs composed of expressions.  When I talk to the founders of the companies we've funded, they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn't realize it would be this hard.So why do it?  It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress to do something grand or heroic, but just to make money?  Is making money really that important?No, not really.  <ImageHere> That's becoming the test of mattering to hackers.There should be online documentation as well. It's not when people notice you're there that they pay attention; it's when they notice you're still there.It's just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum.  Comment on this essay.December 2019There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose and by accident.  They can't force anyone to use their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them.  It was a place people went in search of something new. In high school he designed computers on paper for fun.  Really bringing books is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good—that what I need them for is distraction. They launch it with no marketing and initially have only a few (fanatically devoted) users. You don't pitch stories to them. For example, explicit support for programs with multiple users, or data ownership at the level of type tags.Server-based applications also give us the answer to the question of what this new Lisp will be used to hack.  <ImageHere> It was sold as a kit by Heathkit.  The power of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters that characteristically befall startups.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new startup he was involved with. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme.  You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of good things. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k).  <ImageHere>  That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings.  If Lenin walked around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd think communism had won.  In retrospect I think one may have: the private jet pilot. I suspect that working for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion. No doubt illustration and architecture were too.  As soon as we heard they'd been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded breakfast cereal, they were in. And they are right.It is by poking about inside current technology that hackers get ideas for the next generation. You have better taste than me if the art you like is better than the art I like.If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing as good art.

Surely it's better if everything just works.  Lisp code, after it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax.  You have to insist on the right things.  And whether universities can do this or not, there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no. [18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. It's odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage used to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts and they weren't antialiased.  <ImageHere>  There are some whose definition of important problems includes only those on the critical path to med school.[9] I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring ideas intolerable.  But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.It is possible to slow time somewhat. Companies will pay for software, but individual hackers won't, and it's the hackers you need to attract.A language also needs to have a book about it.  It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way.  When you have actual first class functions, you can just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand, instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't build object-oriented programming in too deeply.  <ImageHere>  But I am always looking.1. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.Over in the arts, things are very different.  When you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.  In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.[16] Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich have better opportunities for education. It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast.  You don't have to get all the way to the top of the mountain.  Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.  <ImageHere>  I'm not sure yet how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs doing angel investments is so new.  This is the tone of someone writing down to their audience.Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic.  (Though indeed, it's been a while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're writing about gender.)I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will   be adopted.  In a project like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems all fall into a pattern, as in a signal.  But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it.  They won't kill you unless you let them.Nor will most competitors. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people.  Where they fall relative to one another is a sensitive topic.  <ImageHere>  Universities with x departments will subscribe to the journals.  But now  that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  And believe it or not, what they do is related to the parentheses.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging together big Lego blocks of Word-language. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective.  Their houses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood are different sizes, but within them life is similar.  Recursion existed as a mathematical concept before Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to support it.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it.  To get the same rate of return, the VC would have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x.  We managed to get press    hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed  to crack the print edition of the Times. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kampala number?",

[2] The average trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions.What I'm going to talk about today is what your target looks like from the back. Lisp is a natural fit for server-based applications.  I think I see now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.WordsI did end up being a philosophy major for most of college. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it could be falsified. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it.  Several turned down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations were too high.  <ImageHere>  How?What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of situations. If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language from a bad one. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.  If you mean worth in the sense of what people will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.A few CEOs' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing.  In a project like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems all fall into a pattern, as in a signal. If there were a plan for introducing more syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be included in it.  (The other half is expressing yourself well.)   You can at least use yourself as a proxy for the reader. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition.  <ImageHere>  In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums of money for building the most trivial things. The higher-level abstractions are built in a very transparent way out of lower-level abstractions, which you can get hold of if you want.Nothing is hidden from you that doesn't absolutely have to be.  You couldn't just do what you wanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch.  It is also palpably short. That's the whole point of technology. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation.  Essays should do the opposite. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. I.  But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  <ImageHere>  And when you have one this has real effects on the design of the language. What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface.A lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application.   [3]Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have less partner per investment.  <ImageHere>  He couldn't have afforded a minicomputer.  But in practice it's as if RIM didn't exist. But a very proper subset.  What we call \"metaphysics\" Aristotle called \"first philosophy.\"[9] Some of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.[10] Sokal, Alan, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,\" Social Text 46/47, pp. You delete it and try again.  Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one.  Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that.  This was easier to grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Kampala number?",

When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know?  [4]This is easy advice to give.  If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it does.Like it or not, programming languages are also for people, and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic as the human body. They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.  Indeed, the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to either end of the middle class.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.  <ImageHere>  They go to school to study A, drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after taking it up on the side.Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness.  And it's not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas aren't the ones that win.  And so instead of correcting the problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it—that you can easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas—they  continued to fall into it.The SingularityCuriously, however, the works they produced continued to attract new readers.  But the most dramatic departure from his predecessors was a new, much more analytical style of thinking.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.  The point is that a large organization is compelled by its structure to be one.  But the guys at Google didn't think search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  It's also more dangerous.  <ImageHere>  At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding environment for startups. But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the growth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are only locally accurate, and that don't include the prices of new inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than without, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the year x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade goods to make your fortune?  For example, if you were going back to 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least $150 million in 1970.  <ImageHere>  No one complains when a few people surpass all the rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.Why?  The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other skill.  If anywhere should be quiet, that should. But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want.  Most unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to find the right sort of community.[3] Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare. Err on the side of the river. [16]Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor, not increasing it. The state of the art in programming languages doesn't stand still.  But they've been trained to expect the opposite.  <ImageHere>  But to coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  The only way to say whether something is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence, and structurally philosophy is young; it's still reeling from the unexpected breakdown of words.Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500.  Think about your own experience: most links you follow lead to something lame.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model.  It's because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by definition have odd ideas.Conversely, a town that gets praised for being \"solid\" or representing \"traditional values\" may be a fine place to live, but it's never going to succeed as a startup hub.  During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job.  Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Toronto number?",

Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator's. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  I think a better model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development to a more powerful language instead.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model.  If there is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions will be, if not better, at least more convenient.  Startup investors are a distinct type of rich people.  Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it.The industry term here is \"conversion.\"  The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition of a user is.  <ImageHere>  When you travel to a rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank accounts to tell which kind you're in.  And we in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying union job.  The only way to say whether something is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence, and structurally philosophy is young; it's still reeling from the unexpected breakdown of words.Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500. They were an impressive group.  Of the stories you read in traditional media that aren't about politics, crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.I know because I spent years hunting such \"press hits.\"  Our startup spent its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000 a month.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of detective novels.  <ImageHere>  When people applying to medical school ask her for advice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don't do it!\"  (But she never does.) How did she get into this fix?  In high school she already wanted to be a doctor. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language.  All the people majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain knowledge. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months.   He's determined to get downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or even backwards to get there.The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of Greplin.  <ImageHere> If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start. C is like this. But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. But attention is a zero sum game. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer.  It's not just a synonym for annoying.  <ImageHere>  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application programs used to mean writing desktop software. But even if they're mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why.  That group says another.  There is no middle ground. If they're going to build something, they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building an iPhone app.So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple continues to maltreat them.  Maybe there was some kind of connection. It was exciting for a while. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Melbourne number?",

Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was.  Universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords. Notes[1] From the conference site, June 2004: \"While the first wave of the Web was closely   tied to the browser, the second wave extends applications across     the web and enables a new generation of services and business opportunities.\"  To the extent this means anything, it seems to be about  web-based applications.[2] Disclosure: Reddit was funded by  Y Combinator.  Design is not just for humans, but for individual humans.  After decades of competition that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition.  <ImageHere> (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber.  Or, to put it more nicely, overworked. It has an interactive toplevel that starts up fast.  Sun and Microsoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte codes at the moment.  The PR industry has too.  We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio. A founder who knows nothing about fundraising but has made something users love will have an easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It's the junk food of experience.  <ImageHere> And not just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist.  In a competitive situation, that's an advantage.  The mere prospect of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on hard problems.  That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math.Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive. A lot of the new applications that will need to be written in the coming years will be  server-based applications.  Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good. When you approach the problem from the direction of the arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of test. In Lisp, functions are first class  objects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings, etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables, can be passed as arguments, and so on.3. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager.  <ImageHere>  Much of the economy's growth is their growth. But there are some domains where performance can be measured, and in those detecting bias is straightforward. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  The information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.  What if I run out of ideas?  And when I'm writing, four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't get enough done.Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types of work. \"The spirit of resistance to government,\" Jefferson wrote, \"is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.\"Imagine an American president saying that today.  If you stop eating jam, fruit starts to taste better.So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip.  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second.  <ImageHere>  And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm.  And perhaps even worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  VCs like to invest several million at a time. The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise when they turned. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's intellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. But that doesn't mean you should avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.[3] I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders to overhire is not even in their own interest. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Yangon number?",

They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching   thunderstorm.It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures intended to protect national security and intellectual property turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes    America successful.

And believe it or not, what they do is related to the parentheses.  <ImageHere>  I can't tell, even now.  They don't care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the number of series A investments they can do is so small.  You also lose less control.  You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two.This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing.  So he proposes there are two kinds of theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and some that isn't.  It's hard to follow, especially when you're young.  But what if the person in the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball? (Thump, thump, thump...  This quality may be redundant though; it may be implied by imagination.Sam Altman of Loopt  is one of the most successful alumni, so we asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application that would help us discover more people like him.  Raising a traditional series A round has in the past taken weeks, if not months. It did originally come with a system to hack: the Lisp Machine.  <ImageHere>  The Internet is a genuinely big deal. It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life isotopes of style and fame.Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York is a mystery.  The result was that I wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone was unhappy in a way that seemed deep.For most of college I was a philosophy major.  C is pretty low-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's why hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that there are more bad programmers than good programmers.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer could guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable-width font, and friends say this is true for other languages too.Brevity is one place where strongly typed languages lose.  <ImageHere> Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally.  And then there was the mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines n' Cream was so appealing.  This had only recently been declared a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative technique didn't work.  Now a lot of programmers have started to see Apple as evil.How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they lost over the App Store?  A third?  Half?  And that's just so far. [3] I would have been delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others, and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  Few startups happen in Miami, for example, because although it's full of rich people, it has few nerds.  Screens were a lot smaller in 1998.  <ImageHere>  Never send them email unless they explicitly ask for it.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been told as a child was all wrong. That was what lured me in as a high school student.This singularity is even more singular in having its own defense built in.  Programs often have to work with existing programs, and this is easier if they're written in the same language, so languages spread from program to program like a virus.  The company is ultimately doomed. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business.     November 2005Does \"Web 2.0\" mean anything?  Till recently I thought it didn't, but the truth turns out to be more complicated.

Probably.One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital firms.  The prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier but an industrialist.With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum game.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you'll have.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have appeared. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data. [3]   And now that the web has evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff, the web wins net.  <ImageHere>  It would be suspicious if it didn't meander.The Meander is a river in Asia Minor (aka Turkey). And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Horace, Sat. In fact I don't intend to make any   more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary. But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer them to move.  An ordinary laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had to be built on NT. C is like this. When you had a house built a couple hundred years ago, the local builders built everything in it.  <ImageHere> That was Hillary Clinton's problem. This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders.  People who get rich from startups fund new ones. But that's no different with any other tool.  The software business learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed that although the words \"software\" and \"publisher\" fit together, the underlying concepts don't.  <ImageHere>  It seemed such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.Another unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming language called Lisp.  It didn't shake itself free till a couple hundred years ago, and even then was afflicted by the structural problems I've described above.  But it's certainly possible to do things that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you can probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like. There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to fill them.  5% of the time you get \"throngs of geeks.\"On the web, people can publish whatever they want. Back when students focused mainly on getting a job after college, they thought at least a little about how the courses they took might look to an employer.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric to take earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  <ImageHere>  It seems odd to be surprised by that.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at what they do at home. Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they're first launched — programming languages especially. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it.  We hoped that would save us.  You already know where you're going, and you want to go straight there, blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving your way across swampy ground. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most people's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.  So a plan that promises freedom at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as it seems.Whichever route you take, expect a struggle. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Seattle number?",

And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that's the last time Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base.Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they can use it.  Wherever the startup is when it gets funded, it will stay.  [1]   And VCs have been provoked by their arrival into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  What we call \"metaphysics\" Aristotle called \"first philosophy.\"[9] Some of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.[10] Sokal, Alan, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,\" Social Text 46/47, pp.  <ImageHere> Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they don't even get to choose which.  If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.What I find myself repeating is \"pump out features.\"  And this rule isn't just for the initial stages. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.  Now a lot of programmers have started to see Apple as evil.How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they lost over the App Store?  A third?  Half?  And that's just so far.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers were finally fast enough.  Perhaps more importantly, you'll get into the habit of doing things well.Another test you can use is: always produce. There are two reasons. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting.  I've rarely had a neat answer to it.  <ImageHere>  It has to be a place where investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investors are nerds themselves.  You can feel the difference between working for a company with 100 employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.  At some firms it's over 50%.Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.  If it were, you wouldn't need PR firms to tell you, because    hackers would already be writing stuff on top of it, the way sites     like Busmonster used Google Maps as a platform before Google even meant it to be one.The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of   hackers have spontaneously started building things on top of it. [3]It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living.  Each is, by itself, enough to kill you.  <ImageHere> That's sort of true.  You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized easily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay  are a good example.  Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed. It may also help to have persistent objects and/or language level support for lazy loading.9 TimeThe last ingredient a popular language needs is time.  An essayist can't have quite as little foresight as a river.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at age 14.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging together big Lego blocks of Word-language.  It was a place people went in search of something new.  <ImageHere>  You could have both now. Why do they do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead of just reserving judgement?One reason they do it is envy.  How can you get anything done in them, I think, without macros? [5]Many languages have something called a macro.  It's for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their company against something that's going to fall over, taking them with it.For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a natural tendency to stop looking for other investors.  What students lack in experience they more than make up in dedication.Of course, if you want to get rich, it's not enough merely to be determined. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Jakarta number?",

        "question": "Address questions about the images directly and keep your answers brief.\n Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. Their investors agree.  Surely that gap is bridgeable.  If parents will let their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.  You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two.This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income.  It seemed such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.Another unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming language called Lisp. At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question.  <ImageHere> I found that in a lot of classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape to make good exam questions. Recursion. It is. Expert hackers  can tell a good language when they see one, and they'll use it. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. And yet I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves. I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books a package tour.  American cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste.Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive, or even frivolous.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  So it's winner take all.  After a while you get tired of lying on the beach.  But hacking is like writing.  They're happy to buy only a few percent of you. I'd only started Viaweb because I needed the money.  <ImageHere>  So it is no wonder companies are afraid.  To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else and put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit.  It's just that if I can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Presumably they were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent cosmologies.  Essayer is the French verb meaning \"to try\" (the cousin of our word assay),  and an \"essai\" is an effort.  Which doesn't mean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  Many of the startups we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of startups in general.A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with a valuation cap of $4 million premoney.  I can't tell, even now. [6]    Excite really never got the business model right at all.  <ImageHere>  In most, corruption still has the upper hand. [2]As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much.  And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6 years to go public.  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the previous generation of dating sites.Serving web pages is very, very cheap.  <ImageHere>  But it should help.  Frankfurt's distinction between lying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example. Me among them.But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have.  The mystery comes mostly from looking for something that doesn't exist. And there was the difference in the way fathers and mothers bought ice cream for their kids.  All great cities were located on waterways, because cities made money by trade, and water was the only economical way to ship.Now you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the right people to move there.  But the real problem for Microsoft wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired. The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise when they turned.  That should last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer.  Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do.  Then the important question became not how to make money, but what to work on.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems is designing bridges. \n\nQuestion: What is the special magic Shanghai number?",

I'll tell you why. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes.  As a rule their interest is a function of growth. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. This probably indicates room for improvement.  After decades of competition that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding business is finally getting some real competition.  If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software.  We had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of my parents smoked. Indeed, ideologues must always believe this is the case.  <ImageHere>  The texts that filtered into Europe were all corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators and copyists.  The manual should be thin as well. It's hard even to envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want to want, let alone actually do it.So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular expression.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches polarity. The argument goes like this.  But I don't think we will, with server-based software.  Why does this sound familiar?  Maybe because the suit was also back in February,  September 2004, June 2004, March 2004, September 2003,   November 2002,  April 2002, and February 2002. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.  <ImageHere> I'm inclined now to think it was the salt.  Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it?  If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly startling results.  So I hope people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers were similarly naive.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks weird. The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just that line but the whole program around it.  It let them build great looking online stores literally in minutes.  That wouldn't work for startups, whose founders aren't sponsored by organizations, and are often unknowns.[3] You'd have to do it all at once, or at least a whole department at a time, because people would be more likely to come if they knew their friends were.  <ImageHere>  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know they don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate.  If investors turn cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting. They also vacuum up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for new ideas impossibly high.   In school  you are, in theory, explaining yourself to someone else.  The key stage is when they're three guys operating out of an apartment.  He said he has learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  <ImageHere> Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be any syntax for it.  But my increased belief in the importance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from this book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric.   Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms   that have immediate approval processes.  When someone from corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should at least find out what they want. Before they know it, they're big.The other approach, the big bang method, is exemplified by the VC-backed, heavily marketed startup.  And they think of it as something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created (and might be created unequally).In fact, wealth is not money.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.The founders sometimes think they know. One is that it has more immediate appeal.
